the present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the studies carried out by the Committee for Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package directions ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for inclusion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B . wir@@ res thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , where patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is applied to fast control of increased un@@ rest or behaviour disorders , if the oral in@@ gest@@ ion of the drug is not possible .
with both diseases , the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients , using the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this imp@@ airs signal transfer between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is probably mainly known as &quot; partial ag@@ gregation &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in lower dimensions as the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter effect , to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol carries to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain that prevents psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their repet@@ ition will be prevented .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , re@@ loc@@ ating the symptoms , was examined in three trials over up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases that were compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a placebo for two hours .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which had been stabili@@ zed at 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the symptoms of patients suffering from a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment were examined .
the company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absorb the melting tablets and the solution for inclusion ( absor@@ bs ) .
in the two studies with the injection of injection showed patients that received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy were effective in four of five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo .
Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo re@@ juven@@ ating Man@@ ic episodes in pre @-@ treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses have also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were equally effective like Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , ac@@ ath@@ isie ( trem@@ or ) , vom@@ iting ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , vom@@ iting , Nau@@ sea ( di@@ lap@@ id@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting , di@@ zz@@ iness ( di@@ lap@@ id@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and during which the man@@ ic episodes had in the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks .
in addition , the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injec@@ tion@@ ists in the fast control of increased distur@@ b@@ ance and disorder in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
an increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients of 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lower initi@@ ation should be considered a lower initi@@ ation ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the CY@@ P3@@ A4 has induc@@ ted from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ ally behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder not increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ emia disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials published a year or less , there were occas@@ ional reports about during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol occurring Dy@@ nasty .
if patients were treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis , it should be retired to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggests a m@@ n , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ cies should be used in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or at entran@@ ces , which may be used with caution .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in patients associated with psych@@ osis which were treated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo .
however , there was one of these studies , a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ box or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there is no precise risk assessment for hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ related adverse events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used with sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar mania , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , and may lead to serious complications .
as a result of the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol on the central nervous system , caution when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.8 ) .
the H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol to 107 % while the C@@ max remains unchanged .
it is expected to have other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects , and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions .
with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabolism , the joint application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ eases , may have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y together with an excessive increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ ar@@ z@@ ol ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to in@@ adequate data security for people and due to the concerns expressed in the animal production studies , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits just@@ i@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics the patients should be warned against control , dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has no negative influence .
the following adverse events are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as a placebo @-@ relevant safety side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study about 52 weeks occurred when patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , including a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ nasty , compared to patients treated with hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7,3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients receiving placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy .
Man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled trial of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3,3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ean controlled laboratory parameters emerged , no medical significant differences revealed .
enh@@ ancements in the C@@ p@@ k ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects , which may occur in connection with a anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about whose occurrence also has been reported in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis syndrome , undes@@ irable cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch an un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol alone was observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 m@@ g. and without death sequence .
there are no information on the effectiveness of a ha@@ em@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis is in treating an over@@ dose of benefits , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol has a high plasma integration .
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is medi@@ ated by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance about the combination of a partial ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 receptor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4- , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ no@@ rep@@ ortage and for hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 m@@ g. a day for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the Pos@@ it@@ est emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ad@@ one , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to placebo .
in a week of 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who were involved in the study medicine was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Dep@@ res@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which stood at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients under@@ went a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg ) at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active controls for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol showed a lasting effectiveness in week 3 and a conservation effect , comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the mania to such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing clinical symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial of more than 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol achieved a re@@ mission in response to placebo during a stabili@@ zation phase , mainly during the prevention of a bi@@ polar accident , predominantly in the prevention of a failure case in Man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P2@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ ness is cat@@ aly@@ zed through CY@@ P3@@ A4 .
the average elim@@ ination time for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol using CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; Po@@ or &quot; ) metabol@@ ites over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed no gender dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to draw conclusions on their met@@ abolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , reproduction tox@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the can@@ ic potential the pre@@ clinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings .
tox@@ ic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injec@@ tion@@ solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tions can be termin@@ ated and started using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to minim@@ ise res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is strongly recommended by adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) depends on the individual clinical status , taking into account of the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigation on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tion@@ solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ins in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tion@@ solution is considered necessary , the patients should be observed in extreme conditions or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
exam@@ inations for the safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tion@@ solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by the prescribed or illegal medicine ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol should be used with caution in patients with known cardi@@ ovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ emia disorders ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are used for hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ zel@@ er@@ ated and mal@@ ign@@ ant shape ) .

clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , per@@ spiration and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally used with sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar mania , based on anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and may lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , applied in healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) and administered at the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H2 ant@@ agon@@ ist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions .
after placing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial study about 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients receiving placebo .
in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was treated for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ean controlled laboratory parameters emerged , no medical significant differences revealed .
enh@@ ancements in C@@ p@@ k ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

110 and behavi@@ oral problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tion@@ solution combined with statist@@ ically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol injec@@ tions associated with a statist@@ ically significant increase in symptoms and behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference poor .
the mean average improvement of the initial average at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with severe episodes or patients with severe ag@@ itation , a similar effectiveness was observed in terms of overall population , but a statistical significance was determined based on a reduced patient count .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statist@@ ically significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week of 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients who were involved in the study medicine was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Dep@@ res@@ sy @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which stood at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study included in sch@@ izophren@@ ia more than 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . 6 % ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing clinical symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on placebo during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a response to placebo regarding the prevention of a bi@@ polar accident , predominantly in the prevention of a return in Man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of 90 % larger the AU@@ C in the same dose as a tablet ; the system@@ ic exposure was similar to both form@@ ulations .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters were earlier an Anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference between medicines and survival in relation to the deteri@@ oration of the disease and survival .
however , in patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , referring to these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ oles in the blood at the start of the treatment .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) pointed out that Abra@@ x@@ ane was not involved in patients with whom the first treatment was not more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2008 the European Commission issued a permit for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first line therapy for metastatic disease is failed and is not indicated for the therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sen@@ sor@@ ial neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
in sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is to inter@@ rupt , until an improvement is reached by Grade 1 or 2 , and at all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with easier to moderate imp@@ air@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dos@@ ing adjustments in patients with imp@@ air@@ ment of the kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to in@@ sufficient data to in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ ar@@ tic form@@ ulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features as other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be absorbed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment will be handled , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated , until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clear with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven , cardi@@ ovascular inci@@ dents are not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cyc@@ line treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ he@@ a , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ forming resources .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied for pregnant women or women in a tender age that is not pract@@ ising an effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is indispensable .
women in tender age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable connection method .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is stim@@ ulated , during and up to six months after treatment no child to bear witness .
male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm con@@ serv@@ ation , because the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) which can affect the ability and ability to serve machines .
below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of adverse events listed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in the piv@@ ot@@ al phase III study .
Ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie was the most obvious important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( at 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ ing ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
in Table 1 the side effects are listed that have occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in any dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased liqu@@ or hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , increased phosph@@ orus in the blood , reduced phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood heart disease :

pain in the chest cor@@ als , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , genital pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ ks , dis@@ comfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent :
rest@@ less@@ ness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitive reactions is calculated based on a definite in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli active ingredient , which promotes the combination of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from tu@@ bing indi@@ genes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules due to in@@ hibition of their de@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in convey@@ s the trans@@ cy@@ t@@ ose of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies , it promotes the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ al transport is convey@@ ed by g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ re@@ receptor and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bin@@ ing protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs in a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two non @-@ sensitive studies and of 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ised phase III comparison study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi @-@ central study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without any pre@@ medi@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
during the recording in the study , 64 % of patients had an imp@@ aired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ ings .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ van@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % because of metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease and progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree of patients who experienced a periph@@ eral of neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy for sound effects on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was investigated in clinical studies .
the effect exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 According to intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centr@@ ation took off in a multi @-@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates an extensive ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft@@ ening binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance by Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) than after a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues is reported that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ ea ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the mean value of less than 1 % of the given total dose associated with less than 1 % of the met@@ abolic 6@@ α hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al Clear@@ ance .
only a few data from over 75 years of age are only available , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in a light light protected over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ fung@@ al drug , and also in other potentially toxic substances should be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood iron values , in which in connection with blood trans@@ fusion could occur , if prior to the procedure , an own blood pressure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml can be expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be introduced under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in treating patients with diseases which is indicated for the medicine .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or to his coun@@ sel@@ or , if they have received a proper guide .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or patients who receive chemotherapy should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ eased at adults respectively between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are used before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and ice cream cones should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients who receive chemotherapy or patients with kidney problems , a an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or thereby that the body is not sufficient on body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin .
Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ etin is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell which was brought into a gene ( DNA ) that they have enabled for the formation of ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
in all patients participating in this study , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they had either been killed or continued to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also added the results of a study in which the effects of inj@@ ected ab@@ duc@@ ed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries were killed in the same measure as in those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison to this , patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ech@@ ly head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ duction can not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa or other of the other components .
ab@@ duction as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered .
the committee for the Human@@ ity agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that it has been provided for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficiency profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information for medical professionals in all Member States , including information about the security of the medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce medicine P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg has granted approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment of an@@ emia and reduction of the transaction requirement for adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who have received chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general public ( e.g. cardi@@ ovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,2 - 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , no iron deficiency might be available or in@@ sufficient , in case of planned surgical procedures , which require a large blood volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
reductions of foreign don@@ ut may be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , where a high risk of transmission comp@@ resses is expected .
HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml will not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pap@@ al patients who should lie between 9,5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial symptoms and tor@@ tured may vary depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; hence the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease management is required by the doctor .
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ins by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ aries can occasionally be observed on or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value exceeds more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the lasting hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ age exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
the patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is at the lowest approved dose which is needed for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance cells than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance cells than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose of 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary , with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
initial symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease of disease ; hence the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease management is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the patients should be closely monitored to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa is at the lowest approved dose which is needed for the control of an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms .
if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ oc@@ ate by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the labels increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l in contrast to the initial value , the dose should be maintained of 150 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg per week .
if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reproduction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times per week the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reproduction of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , should maintain the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
in contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ oc@@ ate &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , respectively the reproduction of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , is unlikely to increase the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa therapy and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ ventive storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned is required , should receive a dose of 600 i.@@ E. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the surgical procedure .
with the iron sub@@ stitution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous hem@@ or@@ ers program - started to make large iron reserves at the start of the ab@@ duc@@ ed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) .

in case you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia , it will break your therapy with dis@@ mis@@ amed and set how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injec@@ ting into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney illness .
a high hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin value makes the risk of problems with heart or blood vessels and the death of dying could be increased .
when raised or increasing , your doctor may consider an inter@@ ruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the potassium values are again in the norm range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney weakness and clin@@ ically exposed cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ oc@@ ate does not exceed a certain value .
following the present findings , the treatment of blood arm@@ or with ab@@ duc@@ ted adult ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) is not accelerated by the treatment of kidney failure ( kidney failure ) which are not accelerated to the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between Epo@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) and adjust your ab@@ rupt dose accordingly to keep the risk of a blood level of blood ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be varied compared to the advantages of the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa drugs , especially if you have occurred a higher risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cul@@ ine events , e.g. if you have already occurred a thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cul@@ ine events ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ ost@@ atic or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in case you are cancer patient , remember that ab@@ duction as a growth factor for blood cells and certain circumstances may affect the tumor neg@@ atively .
if a greater orthop@@ e@@ dic operation is coming , the cause of your an@@ emia should be investigated and treated accordingly .
if your values of red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ duction , as an increased risk of blood gra@@ ding after surgery is made .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you take Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( funds to re@@ pression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
investigations have no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are used to build the immune system , for example with cancer chemotherapy or HIV chemotherapy .
depending on how your blood arm@@ or ( an@@ emia ) is appe@@ aled to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may re@@ arrange regular blood tests to verify and ensure that the medicine works properly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ at worth a certain value .
once you are well set , you receive regular doses of ab@@ duction between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed to two equal injec@@ tions .
your doctor may re@@ arrange regular blood tests to verify and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lo@@ at value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ emia speaks to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this ensure that the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor may conduct regular blood tests .
if necessary , sh@@ orten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the intervention and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , also learn how to splash yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain bleeding , stroke , temporary thro@@ mb@@ osis , lung cy@@ mb@@ osis , blood vessels ( an@@ em@@ ys@@ men ) , thro@@ mb@@ osis of ret@@ ina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under Er@@ y@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ etin treatment .
eyel@@ ids and lips ( quin@@ oa oil ) and sho@@ cking allergic reactions with symptoms like t@@ ing@@ ling , red@@ ness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and acceler@@ ating pulse were reported in rare cases .
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia means that no more sufficient red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when applying Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ duction - to a blood level of blood cells ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ional vas@@ cul@@ ine events ) .

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in men after men@@ opause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high level of frac@@ turing ( bone mar@@ qu@@ arri@@ es ) , including patients who have suffered a lower trau@@ matic gu@@ ardi@@ ce like the H@@ inf@@ ant ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should have at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hips should receive a big dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or injection into a muscle in front of the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( mean against inflammation ) shortly after the in@@ fusion of occurring symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material was used for zom@@ eta to the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
in the first study nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ rates and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis for over 50 years , who recently had suffered a boun@@ ties over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in total 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again , or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis medicines ) was reduced by 70 % compared to patients suffering from placebo .
in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a question@@ naire ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients receiving placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion agency and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a presents clari@@ fication material for physi@@ cians , which contains indications of the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as similar material for patients in which the drug &apos;s side effects are explained and referred to when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ artis Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to provide approval for the transport of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic Hü@@ ft@@ ist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packing b@@ eil@@ age • contra@@ ction of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing help is &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic Hü@@ ft@@ ist .
treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic zen@@ ith , the administration of the In@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run@@ time period in patients were observed that have been addressed to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic zen@@ ith , an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced due to the application of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
patients with ren@@ al function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose of dose is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination with older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data are missing to in@@ convenience and effectiveness .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because for these patients population only limited clinical experiences .
in front of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with sufficient amounts of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid intervention of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary hypo@@ cris@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) .
in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient amount of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be investigated before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with reasonable pre @-@ ventil@@ ating dental treatment .
for patients who need dental handles do not have data available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduced the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area .
clinical evaluation by treating the doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced due to the application of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe de@@ structive effects reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a were increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) in comparison to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , overall sales of atri@@ al fibr@@ illation between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occas@@ ional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) undes@@ irable drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with ren@@ al function disorders , which is expressed as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases of acute kidney failure .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured prior to the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function was comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis spann@@ ing three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was treated at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on evaluation of the laboratory dogs , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ ctions after a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoid@@ ance of clinical fra@@ ctions of clinical fra@@ ctions , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical study was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion agency such as red@@ ness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) .
Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the area of funds , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) reported that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients or other dental implants .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in a jaw area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia can be reached by the gift of orange calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at equilibrium .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year was indicated for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either one bone di@@ abe@@ tic error or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the sciss@@ or ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
effects on morph@@ ometric cy@@ top@@ ical frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a sen@@ sed significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or more new spinal frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a reduced risk reduction of 60 % compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.0@@ 001 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased bone density on lum@@ bar , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hips at 6.0 % , the threshold of up to 5,@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology were treated with 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the basin .
in contrast to placebo ( µ@@ CT ) analysis , a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the carrying bone volume in comparison to placebo and receiving the carrying bone architecture .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale prolifer@@ ation ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ T@@ elop@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in periods during study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial output and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial output of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was reduced significantly by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment increased in comparison to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total assets and enk@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all time points .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment for an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total assets and 4,3 % at Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized 508 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ ctions in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ ctions amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8,7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 study ) , once again an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the percentage change of Len@@ den@@ om@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light @-@ level serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ times of age @-@ specific upper normal value taken in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day , during 2 months , was detected in two six @-@ month comparison studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of the pain strength and pain influenced in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who have been classified as a result of the six month trial study ( based on therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron patients who was treated at the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron , compared with a mean follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 @-@ 5 @-@ minute incre@@ ment of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
after that , plasma layers rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ ic dis@@ appearance of the big circulation with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ ( 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a termin@@ al eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and white , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , whereas the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance by Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ Systems is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
in this case a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose of dos@@ ing of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
there is no liability for this population ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , for this population , no statements are possible .
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ tering intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C , the 6@@ times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influ@@ encing .
chronic chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application , administered by doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in 3 @-@ day in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C , corresponds to AU@@ C .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which sur@@ passed the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects of other organs , including the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , and the liver , as well as an intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common report in studies with repeated application was an increase in primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ fication of long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all doses , a fund which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance .

the summary of the EP@@ AR for the public document is a summary of the European Public assessment report ( EP@@ AR ) , in which the studies carried out by the committee for the Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abe@@ tic medicine ) is not displayed . • It can be used together with another drug medicine ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , it can not be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fa drugs or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fa drugs may be maintained , except in patients with hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fa resin or insulin .
this means that the body insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
with more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with sul@@ fa resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in a lower@@ ing of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced in application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff showed a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study included in the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision distur@@ ban@@ ces , infections of the upper respir@@ atory ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to irrit@@ ate ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients that might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or another of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ abe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ de ( high level of risk - ac@@ id@@ ation - in blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos within the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( with the sole use ) is used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission announced the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transport of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate ( see section 4.4 ) because of contra@@ indications ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. early heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of continuously .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or est@@ rogen , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ovascular reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and eyel@@ ids when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin .
a cardi@@ ovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and existing advanced macro@@ economic disease has been carried out .
in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output metast@@ ases ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm ) or with other signs of liver illness , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range , the hep@@ atic values are as soon as possible to control again .
if a patient symptoms are developed to refer to hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ial problems , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dark Har@@ n , are the hep@@ atic values of liver .
the decision to continue the treatment of patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on should be continued until the advance of the laboratory parameters was conducted by clinical assessment .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir from fat deposits and linked in some cases with liquid re@@ tention .
as a result of a hem@@ modi@@ ti@@ ally under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ ins by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients , pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale two or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing dependent hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia .
after the launch , Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of an di@@ abe@@ tic mac@@ ular mac@@ ular hole with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but ord@@ n@@ ating doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients should be considered distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ologic diagnosis should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone mar@@ ches of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on were treated .
the calculated Fra@@ ktur was 1.9 fra@@ ctions per 100 patients with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient men@@ opause , which were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a study of 3.5 years of study of cardi@@ ovascular events , frac@@ tures were treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or an entry , treatment is necessary ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on investigation of inter@@ actions showed that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed from these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ a@@ emia and increased insulin resistant of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for killing growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data not estim@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refra@@ ctive index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T jumps over thre@@ e@@ fold the upper limit of the norm range also frequently as under Plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups in met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ economic disease , the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than in Plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch , rare on heart failure under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reports , however , if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone mar@@ ches was random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients treated in similar groups .
over a period of 3.5 years running PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
for taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased insulin sensitive cell of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases periph@@ eral Glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in the case of insulin resistant .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on for 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ised in spite of three @-@ month optim@@ isation , was random@@ ised to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c fell by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued only insulin ; a reduction of insulin delivery in the patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was observed .
clinical trials over a year showed a statist@@ ically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin ( alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin ) compared to the initial results .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , limited to 18 weeks of study on type 2 di@@ abe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction of plasma tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol and minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - Ch@@ olester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduced the total plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to the plac@@ ebo Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was not found in a statist@@ ically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol while under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d reduced values were observed .
in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , but also improved tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de levels , this also improved the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de absorption , as well as to the tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis , as well as to the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ de synthesis .
in the PRO@@ AC@@ T@@ IVE study , a cardi@@ ovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , and existing advanced macro@@ economic disease were random@@ ised in addition to existing an@@ di@@ abe@@ tic and cardi@@ ovascular treatment for either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly absorbed , with the top con@@ centric concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
this basis corresponds to the contribution from M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral application of radioactive mark@@ er Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and found a lower degree in the resin ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma centr@@ ations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance are similar .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not capable of using insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ col ) hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured in the study , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane resulted in a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spiegel@@ s that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strongly lowered as with another human@@ oid .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients that might be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package ) .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane survived in the treatment of diabetes over the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for marketing approval of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the whole European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a quick initi@@ ating effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
the injec@@ tions pin must be left under the skin at least 6 seconds to ensure that the total dose is inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood glucose is significantly improved by intensive insulin therapy , the hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ warning symptoms can be perceived and should therefore be advised accordingly .
any change in thickness , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ polar , long @-@ acting insulin , human insulin or insulin @-@ analog@@ ous ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can result in a change of dosage .
if the change is necessary at Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients who compet@@ ed hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go beyond multiple time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the Council of his doctor , as such travels can be applied , or used to be used or taken to other times .
therefore , the doctor must consider possible inter@@ actions taken in the therapy and ask his patients to other medicines .

the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and total time duration is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ ption profile is established in the fact that it concerns a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied to patients , which have already reported signs of Crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or bile node ( &quot; bricks &quot; i.e. greater urine @-@ cryst@@ all@@ deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ eased after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there may still occur exposure cases ; therefore it is recommended that the patients suffer at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even more medicines for prevention of exposure .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an transplan@@ tation since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study enrolled in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a placebo ( placebo medicine ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for treating hypertension ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used twice a day of 300 mg ; patients suffering from kidney problems were obtained only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary intake in the blood was below 6 mg / dl .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 from 262 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of income , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once daily intake a urine of urine in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo in the case .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ he@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with heart complaints in the pre@@ history , potentially risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lower@@ ing of the urine production in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hypertension in diseases that have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the medical history or currently present gar@@ den@@ ds and / or a behavi@@ oral arthritis ) .
if the serum har@@ ness is still taken into account after 2 @-@ 4 weeks &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , a dose of dose can be considered at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function , the efficacy and safety has not yet been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , when there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .

liver disease During phase 3 , light ab@@ normal@@ ities of liver function values were observed with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before beginning of the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was performed no interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ s ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with a increase in the F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of unwanted events .

in a study involving subjects 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily indicates a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide is delayed by the absorption of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline of the C@@ max at 32 % , but no significant changes in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ ancies do not leave on side effects of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .

the lower@@ ing of the serum @-@ acid cycle on &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the physician attendance in week 2 and permanently maintain over the entire treatment .
509 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ments &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .

there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of dec@@ ency of serum concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl About 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a ser@@ en@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the lasting decrease in the incidence of genetic defects resulted in less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a delay ) .
this was associated with a reduction of nar@@ rati@@ os size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of the stor@@ k notes up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - Val@@ ues ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also received the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are bre@@ ached ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk for a low vitamin D mirror exists .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or use of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
to avoid an irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in medicines which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also led a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D reflection .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels had been treated with the patients who have been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who made solely al@@ end@@ ron@@ at income ( 32 % ) .
the company also submitted data to include the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is needed for preventing a bone of bone .
the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the digest@@ ion device ( muscles , bone or joints ) and symptoms of digest@@ ive devices such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( digest@@ ion ) , c@@ eases ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , dri@@ fts ( ul@@ cer ) , driven abdom@@ en ( blind@@ ed stomach ) as well as aci@@ res .
in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other ingredients may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be used when diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following critics are exactly to follow the risk for ös@@ op@@ ha@@ al irrit@@ ation and thus related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed by the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w or leave the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. p@@ ept@@ ic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age or surgical inter@@ ventions in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only be given under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ c@@ tures , were reported in patients under taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( some were severe and required a hospital instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore notice attention to all signs and symptoms , which should be pointed out on possible anti @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation like dy@@ spher@@ ia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain or a new or wor@@ sen@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn the medicine and take care of medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ al side effects seems to be increased by patients that does not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dos@@ ing transfers to the patient are passed and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .

there is no data available to give tips , if the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure to dimin@@ ish the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw .
clinical assessment by treating the doctor is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their so@@ ber@@ y .
you should not take two tablets at the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be adequ@@ ately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at has been taken in clinical trials along with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without having clin@@ ically relevant interaction effects .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither applicable during pregnancy nor by l@@ act@@ ating women .
animals studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly har@@ rowing effects in regard to pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients to prevent kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ sion of transplan@@ t organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft is already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , with the use of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was canc@@ eled after a treatment duration of one year ( for example , as often a renewed organ transplan@@ tation or a res@@ um@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
furthermore , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were performed with liver transplan@@ tation and exam@@ ines how Ad@@ vag@@ raf is absorbed by the body as compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with sensitive hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other ingredients may not be applied .
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs are taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the Ad@@ vag@@ ue dose or the dose of the simultaneous drug may be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are entru@@ sted with the immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should be prescribed by this medicine or make changes in the immune supp@@ ress@@ ant therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft gra@@ ft or to an increased incidence of side effects , including sub@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; the form@@ ulation of the form@@ ulation or the regim@@ es should only be performed under the close control of a medical master ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
as a result of a change@@ over to an alternative wording , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ ing adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case and based on blood pressure regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recomm@@ end@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot;
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ si should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 the system@@ ic exposure was measured as Tal@@ mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspection of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ ks are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ t phase .
because Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can take an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the state of patients in the first postoperative phase does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ion of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be led intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application to the op@@ pression of transplan@@ tation should not be maintained ; consistent , therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose regim@@ en - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft gra@@ ft . the or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift on the morning .
further dose can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation .
dose of liver transplan@@ t - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of gra@@ ft gra@@ ft . the or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift on the morning .
dos@@ ing recommended dosage - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a gra@@ ft receptor of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , obtained in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over from other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sy to Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must begin the treatment with the recommended genital initi@@ als recommended for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation .
heart transplan@@ t For adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ raf is an oral initi@@ ation of 0.15 mg / kg / day every day .
other transplan@@ t receiver has no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ k@@ transplan@@ ted patients , came in an oral initi@@ ation of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in a oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in a oral initi@@ ation of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dos@@ ing adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood cells in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction a down@@ gra@@ dation of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function , as the ren@@ al function is no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , can be assumed that a dose of dose is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ otic potenti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ otonin levels , calcul@@ ating the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vaginal At the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advis@@ able ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to Tal@@ ut The Dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in single @-@ blood @-@ pot@@ ent Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ king Contro@@ ls .
it is recommended to perform common controls on the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Tal@@ mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood sugar levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled by Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tion , modifications of the immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ y@@ raf is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical trials can conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Tal@@ mirror does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the Tal@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are usually located in the first time after liver transplan@@ tation in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml , and cor@@ n@@ ated patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
usually blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used during the subsequent development of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease .
this has resulted in serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft gra@@ fts or other side effects , which may occur in sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Sub@@ - or Over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus form@@ ulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; the form@@ ulation of the form@@ ulation or the regim@@ es should only be performed under the close control of a medical master ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft gra@@ dient , which has proven to be treated compared to other immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ res@@ sy , are not yet clinical data for the ret@@ arded form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
for the proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of transplan@@ tation in adult heart transplan@@ t and gra@@ ft gra@@ fts in the childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded form@@ ulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
due to possible interaction that lead to a down@@ grade of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the in@@ gest@@ ation of the tac@@ kling of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may contain , or other plant agents ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , or other plant agents during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood , because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood mirrors can be subject to considerable variations under such circumstances .
in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f known as Kar@@ di@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed that can therefore occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an existing heart disease , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , liquid over@@ load and o@@ gens .
like in other immun@@ os@@ u@@ res@@ sy , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothing or use of a sun protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients take the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms of pre@@ s such as head@@ aches , changes of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision distur@@ ban@@ ces should show a radi@@ ological examination ( eg .
da Ad@@ vag@@ raf hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ant , l@@ act@@ ose , is provided with patients with the rare her@@ me@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption special caution .
simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicinal products , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and therefore reduce blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine blood levels while maintaining the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , to monitor and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage with compensation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction effect was associated with anti@@ fung@@ ic@@ ot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly derived from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal pollution .

effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as CY@@ P3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed through CY@@ P3@@ A4 , affect their metabolism .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ sts and thus increase the hormone exposure , is particularly careful in decisions on sensitive action @-@ contrac@@ ting measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and Phen@@ az@@ on and their half @-@ time can extend .
the results of a low number of exam@@ inations on transplan@@ t@@ ational cancer does not notice that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus a increased risk of unwanted events in regard to the course and result of pregnancy .

it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ ma including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours related to the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water @-@ soluble and high binding on er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma rot@@ ein can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ able .
active effect and pharmac@@ ological effects on molecular level might be convey@@ ed by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ) used .
the dosage and frequency of application then apply if Adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A suffer from a factor of VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) has been brought to the formation of the human Ger@@ inn@@ ate directive VIII .
Adv@@ ate is another drug licensed drug in the European Union , similarly , but is produced otherwise , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate at the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood levels has been awarded with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of anti@@ bodies towards factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval by the company B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit for the marketing of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dosage : dosage and duration of the sub@@ stit@@ utes act according to the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of patients .
in the following ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not drop under the specified plasma element ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute imp@@ air@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) , until the risk is over for the patient .
during treatment it is stim@@ ulated to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions a proper determination of the factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ values .
3 proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ y@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VIII per kg body weight by a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII are not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the adoption of the patient should be determined after the purpose of the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alising anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ cooperative activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that are qu@@ anti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ positi@@ onable days is most important and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ positi@@ agen and an@@ am@@ ne@@ ous inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , re@@ loc@@ ating ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare adv@@ ancing of the H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A in women lie on the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s ( 5 patients ) occurring in the largest number of patients who had previously untreated patients showed a higher risk to formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10.000 ( not known as frequency on the available data not estim@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ( 1 - 14 days post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
during the whole period , blood cl@@ ots were maintained during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ oper@@ operational day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a companion heavier to moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 Ex@@ positi@@ vity ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , none of the 53 pe@@ ach@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and a median of moderate H@@ äm@@ op@@ hi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was observed after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
previously untreated clinical study enrolled 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients against factor VIII .
the immune response of the patients on tracks of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the analysis of anti @-@ antibody tit@@ res against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statist@@ ically significant up@@ trend as well as a prolonged Peak of anti @-@ ch@@ o @-@ cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients received the occurrence of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study of the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has been further evaluated as a positive rating , but considering that safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons :
therefore , CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months required that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension procedures in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has with@@ drawn its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
however , they are the breast , the brain , bone or soft@@ parts ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body , surrounds and relies ) of them affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been gene@@ tically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus &quot; that has been so modified that there can be no copies of themselves and therefore no infections can trigger for people .
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have to be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the cancer cells to make the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defect in the human body , is usually used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share themselves .
the company made data from a study involving a patient with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of sub@@ tree , in the bone and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the data submitted by the initial documents , CH@@ MP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company by day .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ours has not been benefits for the patient .
the Committee also had concerns about the processing of drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine .
in addition , the company had not been adequ@@ ately proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company didn &apos;t note the CH@@ MP note whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other is released over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by an allergy to p@@ ollen ( inflammation of the nose paths ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ g@@ inal swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and teenagers over 12 years , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice daily is a tablet containing a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ oned .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the block@@ age of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms that were reported from patients at the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and valu@@ ate with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms have been in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms except the const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , compared to a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % compared to patients who were p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed an alle@@ vi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ cardi@@ itis , di@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( lack of appetite ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis ( appetite ) , som@@ nia , in@@ som@@ nia , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be hyper@@ sensitive to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against rep@@ ain@@ able active agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another drug for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not applied .
Aer@@ in@@ aze can also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glau@@ coma ( high blood pressure ) , heart or blood diseases including hypertension ( hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) , cardi@@ ovascular disease ( caused by a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swallowed as a whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing them , to break down or che@@ w ) .
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used due to lack of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after termination of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as for long term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can be taken at time .
following the decline of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respir@@ ation , treatment may be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as a mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also counter@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amin@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy .
this is attri@@ but@@ able to alph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ cri@@ bs such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , per@@ oral or nas@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ kin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations on the dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients suffering from kidney or liver function , and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations to dosage .
patients need to be informed about the treatment of a hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a speed@@ ometer , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) .
with the treatment of the following patient arms , patients with heart rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bli@@ ster@@ y or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours prior to carrying out dermat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions on indicators for skin reactions or to reduce in their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given , however , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ entr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed .
with the results of the Psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between the patients treated with the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the placebo @-@ treated patients were observed , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not yet identified for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzyme so that interaction with other medicines may not be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in@@ hib@@ its in vi@@ vo CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor any inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
the in@@ convenience of the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences gained from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the frequency of normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals do not always be transferred to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ on@@ stri@@ ctor characteristics of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be used in the pregnancy in the pregnancy .
however , the patients should also be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to a condition which may lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the ability to serve machines .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardi@@ ovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S pac@@ ing ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ et@@ ries ) with possible let@@ tering .

a CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dri@@ ness , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin anxiety , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ ammat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ics / b@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the addition of the addition of the expression of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of subjective gl@@ asting or tasks that are linked to flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed daily .
the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can produce further sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a speed@@ ometer or manifestation of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al .
it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the total co@@ res for symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ ine ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by means of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in about the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin .
within a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached in day 10 .
in the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dos@@ cope study , which was carried out with the form@@ ulation as a tablet of healthy adult subjects , was determined that four subjects dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in badly changed changed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was given to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repet@@ itive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can not recognize any special dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in general .
in reprodu@@ cible studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / p@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day were not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works , before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to alle@@ vi@@ ating the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect can develop .
Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets lin@@ ers symptoms occur in connection with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running , it@@ ching or ju@@ ck@@ ering eyes with simultaneous const@@ ip@@ ation of the nose .

inform your doctor if you encounter the following symptoms or diseases under the use of Aer@@ in@@ aze or diseases : • hypertension , heart failure • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or rein@@ forcement of existing head@@ aches .
taking Aer@@ in@@ aze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
transport of transport and the use of machines when used in the recommended dosage is not able to calculate that Aer@@ in@@ aze leads to Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ity or reducing attention .
if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze you should immediately notice your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a bigger amount of Aer@@ in@@ aze when you should .
if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ aze if you have forgotten to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose to the specified time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .

after the launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , very rarely about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing not , wh@@ ist@@ le breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling and swelling ) have been reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart failure , stomach pain , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , diarr@@ ho@@ ea , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , in@@ som@@ nia with more serious physical activity , about cases of liver disease and about cases of striking liver values was also very rare .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for inclusion ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml Sir@@ up bz@@ w .
for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml Sir@@ up bz@@ w .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and juven@@ iles with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ r@@ d@@ elling , imp@@ air@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment was determined .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup , the solution for inclusion and melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children are harmless .
in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all trials were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ erial increases to an average decrease of the symptoms ( symp@@ tom number ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to a decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ erial 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or other of the other components .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relie@@ ve the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there are restricted experiences from clinical trials to effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for juven@@ iles from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to the symptoms of the disease and can be resumed after the termination of the symptoms and can be resumed .
in persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended during all @-@ time treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not identified in clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the effect of alcohol imp@@ ed@@ ance was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , the patients should also be clari@@ fied , however , that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ om@@ men@@ ity , which can lead to imp@@ air@@ ment of the ability to serve machines .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients treated with placebo .
the most commonly applied side effects , about the more common than in placebo was ti@@ red@@ ness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ time study in which up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ inet@@ een clinical dose ) were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ infl@@ ammat@@ ory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ics / b@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the addition of the addition of endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
a statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described in the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ discipl@@ ines , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg a day .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no effect on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of subjective gl@@ asting or tasks that are linked to flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ emann , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ tic and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , an allergic rhin@@ itis can be sub@@ divided into an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the total co@@ res of the question@@ naire with Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investig@@ ating a further forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology dis@@ regards the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be pro@@ spec@@ tively pro@@ spective .
since the hist@@ amine release is a cur@@ ricul@@ um factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also confirmed in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the determination of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose of dose .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines , were excluded from the study .
improvement of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and the wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were comparable with the general significant allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was achieved in 4 % of patients .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , however , has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor any inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
in a single dos@@ cope study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fatty food rich breakfast ) did not work on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in performed pre @-@ clinical studies , in a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , genom@@ icity and reprodu@@ ci@@ icity allow the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in no particular dangers to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the writing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years of infection are caused by infection ( see Section 4.4 ) and that there is no data to support an inf@@ ecti@@ ous rhin@@ itis with a@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es we should play a role in diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin testing .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in constra@@ ined and experienced a higher sub@@ st@@ ance load ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us syrup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to the children suffering normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this medicine contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not use her@@ ed@@ itary int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose g@@ act@@ ose absorption or a suc@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not identified in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also given ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study it was not ampli@@ fied by taking A@@ erial tablets and alcohol the most powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the total sti@@ ff@@ ness of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ erial Sir@@ up Group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , when patients treated with placebo .
in a multiple dose of adults and adolescents , up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( n@@ inet@@ een clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old , who came into question for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population .
in the framework of a clinical study of multiple adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dose of up to 20 mg , a statist@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardi@@ ovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
for an single daily dose of 7,5 mg A@@ erial tablets resulted in adults and yo@@ ungst@@ ers in clinical trials to no imp@@ air@@ ment of Psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was neither a ampli@@ fication of alcohol @-@ induced performance imp@@ air@@ ment , nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adults and adol@@ es@@ cent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ erial tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ emann , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ tic and red@@ ness of eyes as well as it@@ ching on the pal@@ ate .
as shown on the basis of the total co@@ res of the question@@ naire with Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the effects caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was effective in enhancing Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the determination of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose of dose .
the spread of this fully met@@ abolic phen@@ otyp@@ s was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ cas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with Sir@@ up@@ form@@ ulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , observed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of a clin@@ ically relevant drug cum@@ ulation after once daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose @-@ studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at the recommended doses were comparable with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in syrup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , however , has not yet been identified , so that interaction with other medicines may not be completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us syrup is offered in type III bra@@ ung@@ ers with child @-@ safe polypropylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ artis V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced that the company has with@@ drawn its application for author@@ ization of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the prevention of avi@@ an H@@ 5@@ N1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of influ@@ enza that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new strain of Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears that can easily spread from human beings because people still have no imm@@ unity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the influ@@ enza virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later in a position to make contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus this Stam@@ ina faster anti@@ bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which det@@ ects the human body as body alien ) , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this reduces the scope of the clinical data base for evalu@@ ating the safety of the vaccine in order to meet the requirements of the EMEA to pre@@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .

it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , causing the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , ash@@ ase is available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken together with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ su@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked the an@@ tivir@@ al drug before the patient has previously used to address the virus to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , taken together with twice daily 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs .
in children between four and twelve years old and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of chor@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , as@@ su@@ ase reduces the HIV quantity in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not capable of healing , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also cause the development of AIDS related infections and diseases .
A@@ generic gases was investigated in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al drugs , however without R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies treated with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who previously did not have been treated with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
this was compared with low do@@ si@@ fied R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicine A@@ generic drugs was compared with 206 adults who used earlier Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ demonstr@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients that previously had not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks of age , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than in placebo , but ash@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , an@@ es@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children , who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors , were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults , who had been treated earlier with Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load ampli@@ fied the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came to four weeks along with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients that their previous prot@@ le@@ ft@@ ers had further income :
the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash , and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 can not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r or any of other components .
as@@ su@@ ase may also not be used in patients , the cur@@ rant we@@ eds ( an herbal supplement to treat depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals that are equally dis@@ soluble in blood levels and are harmful in blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV and HIV , the risk of oph@@ thal@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ros@@ is ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the recover immune system ) .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of a@@ generic medicines in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat pre@@ treated HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
chor@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefits of as@@ semblies in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as it was limited to limited information at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission issued the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to provide an author@@ ization to the transport of as@@ pi@@ ase throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ generic drugs is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ previously treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usually A@@ generic Cap@@ sules should be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ths of am@@ ural avi@@ r along with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inhal@@ ation is 14 % lower than capsule ; hence , A@@ generic Cap@@ sules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram base ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for chor@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r twice daily together with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ generic Cap@@ sules should be used without the added addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ em@@ y ) , higher doses of a@@ or@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for an@@ es@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ bus@@ hing / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of as@@ semblies in combination with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied with children .
ast@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to infin@@ ity and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data the dose should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be contra@@ indicated in patients with more light or moderate liver disorder , with patients suffering from severe liver disorder ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ generic gases must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ o@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements that contain St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ generic ase does not prevent the risk of transmitt@@ ing HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for usually A@@ generic gases are to be used together with low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who are suffering from chronic hep@@ atitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk of severe liver activity with potentially fatal accidents .
for the case of simultaneous treatment of hep@@ atitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with existing limited liver function , including chronic hep@@ atitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
simultaneous use of A@@ generic and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with fluor@@ ine or other glu@@ co@@ oc@@ or@@ ti@@ ci@@ ids that are not recommended that the possible benefits of treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , a simultaneous adoption of A@@ generic drugs with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ol@@ ys@@ is including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ sen .
4 For some medications , causing severe or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm ratio ) are available methods for determination of the drugs concentration .
in patients who use these medicines at the same time , ash@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the kind of interaction .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity due to the high propylene gly@@ col solution , this form@@ ulation can be contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution regarding specific other patient groups .
ast@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
in patients who received anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , was reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia or an ex@@ az@@ ed@@ itary of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses involving their therapy drugs needed to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated with related met@@ abolic disorders .
there are reports of hem@@ op@@ hi@@ lic patients ( Type A and B ) that were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen .
at the time of initi@@ ating an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ infl@@ ammat@@ ory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop which leads to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including use of cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ reg@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , in particular patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) reports .
CY@@ P3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generic gases must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also display sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ o@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width aging with r@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should not be used together with medicines , whose active substances are primarily associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel with severe and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
in trying to offset the degra@@ ded plasma gel by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable effects were observed in the liver .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r can be harvested by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes part of St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ er@@ av@@ irus mirrors and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the cur@@ rant .
a dose of dos@@ ing for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ ven@@ ir@@ enz below ) .
508 % increase , for C@@ max is increased by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day which prove the efficacy and thou@@ ght@@ fulness of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % , if Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ) twice a day .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which have been reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous adoption of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to close @-@ out monitoring , as the efficacy and corruption of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is advised due to the ant@@ acids component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and a@@ generic gases are at least one hour ( see ant@@ acids below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose is required twice daily .
the treatment with E@@ ven@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ ca@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both proteins .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may possibly reduce the serum concentration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advis@@ able because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gel .
if these drugs are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast effect of the effect of the combination of am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r and R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in led to an increase in Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ entr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at 193 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is required along with a@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with a@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ generic in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma layers could be increased in the case of simultaneous adoption .
simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to 2.0@@ 69@@ times in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P3@@ A4 , can be applied together with A@@ generic ase , possibly inter@@ actions .
patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are connected to these medicines if they are used in combination with chor@@ ase .
based on the data of other proteins , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as a@@ generic gases , as it can occur to res@@ or@@ ption disorders .
simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va , known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with ampl@@ ar can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il , which may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug .
simultaneous intake of A@@ generic gases can increase their plasma concentration and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in relation to side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , vision distur@@ ban@@ ces and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ batch intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of ag@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ cos , unless the possible benefit of treatment the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid ac@@ ic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which depends heavily on CY@@ P3@@ A4 , increased increases of plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel in simultaneous adoption of as@@ su@@ ase .
since plasma screens of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ubar@@ y@@ ol@@ ys@@ is , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended to am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r .
it is recommended to increase the therapeutic concentration of therapeutic concentration up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while simultaneously the administration of Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , aspir@@ in may not be used along with oral unanim@@ ous Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while applying A@@ generic Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advis@@ able .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eases inhibit@@ ors may point to a possible increase of plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to 3 @-@ 4 fold .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
due to its low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation , such as the Am@@ ber@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose can be adjusted at the same time , if Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
for the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae along with a@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not predictable , so alternative methods for receptions are recommended .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the current gift of ag@@ glomer@@ ation ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied according to the possible use of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in milk lac@@ tic rats , am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people in breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats who was administered in the uter@@ us to the end of the halt in the uter@@ us until the end of the halt , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight .
the further development of the comments including fertility and reproduction was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ nov@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
in adults and in children aged 4 and 4 , clinical trials have been studied in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , coming up early and rarely led to treatment .
with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they are in connection with the intake of A@@ generic drugs or any other simultaneously on HIV treatment , or if they are a result of the disease .
most of the af@@ ore@@ mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors weren &apos;t treated twice daily .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which have been used in connection with the study group than in connection with the study medi@@ ation , and in more than 1 % of patients receiving laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and fast sub@@ lime tissues , more severely intra@@ ab@@ domin@@ als and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( bul@@ ls ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated people who have been treated with ampl@@ itudes in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in in an average duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( bull &apos;s neck ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , Avastin @-@ treated patients showed up to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in comparison to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is on a median duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin rash were normally mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mak@@ u@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching , and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ously within two weeks , without having to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ o were reported particularly in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
at the time of initi@@ ating an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ infl@@ ammat@@ ory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients receiving 600 mg of A@@ generic R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , species and incidence of the side effects were observed , comparable ; an exception were given increases of tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des and c@@ p@@ k values , which were treated with low do@@ si@@ zed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 and 4 ) .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient may be observed on signs of in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .
Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r binds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the process of viral viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ clu@@ sions with the result of a formation un@@ ripe , not inf@@ ecti@@ ous viral particles .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in human being is not defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients with the currently permitted Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been observed - as in other R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ eases - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral re@@ treated patients who have received 700@@ mg Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study E@@ SS@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure could be investigated by week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ic .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure did not rise inside the 59 , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 36@@ V , M@@ 36@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 62@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 54@@ V , I@@ 8@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V , L@@ 90@@ V and I@@ 93@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ) twice daily : n = 107 ) involved in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical predi@@ ctions for 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ eases inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , Gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used to evaluate the activity of am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations to Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of an vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation samples may be subject to amendments by additional data , and it is recommended to extract the current inter@@ pret@@ ations to analyse the results of resistance tests .
based on phenom@@ enal resistance tests , the phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ation systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ big@@ vi@@ r associated gen@@ esis creates a certain cross @-@ resist@@ ence against R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity of In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there are currently data to cross @-@ resist@@ ence between Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r and other Prot@@ ease In@@ hibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ hi@@ avi@@ r Resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on five @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral , non @-@ treated patients ( one of them showed a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ c@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 ins@@ ults ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice @-@ versa , Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment .
the evidence of efficacy of as@@ es@@ ase in combination with R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ dan@@ al@@ oga ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with the lowest rate of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred thre@@ es@@ hundred and six@@ ty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic gases , at least another PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I have been included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis posed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the period ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ mine threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ oid cases is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution was taken twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22@@ ,5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; most of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD@@ 4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data should be considered at the therapy optim@@ isation with PI in pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ approved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generic ase &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
508 % increase , for C@@ max is lowered by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r 12 hours following dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and the rate of absorption .
the apparent mani@@ pulation volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) and can be found on a large distribution volume and an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active agent in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ question@@ able am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active components during the dos@@ ing concentration in the Ste@@ ady State above the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that have induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its CY@@ P3@@ A4 or sub@@ strate a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P3@@ A4 with caution when they are given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ su@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bi@@ ode@@ gra@@ dable as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ generic solution and ash@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ base .
also the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al disorder on the elim@@ ination of am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r and ra@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low .
this treatment schem@@ as lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ geln comparable to those that are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous appoint@@ ments of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on mice with ampl@@ itudes in mice and rats resulted in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cellular aden@@ oma at dos@@ ages on which the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to human beings , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r , correspon@@ ded .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ ogenic aden@@ oma and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet cleared and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , few indications for accept@@ ing clinical relev@@ ance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene tests , bacterial infections mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mice testing in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation@@ test of human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were included , was Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , clinical trials have not observed any significant hep@@ atic tox@@ icity in patients , neither during the administration of chor@@ o@@ gens even after the end of treatment .
studies of tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated from an age of 4 days , showed high mortality in both the control and with the am@@ bush @-@ treated animals .
during a system@@ ic plasma exposure , which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including Thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ eton changes were observed that indicate a delayed development .
24 If a@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be applied without the added addition of R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ em@@ y ) , higher doses of a@@ es@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied twice daily .
the recommended dose for an@@ es@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ bus@@ hing / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be contra@@ indicated in patients with weak or light liver dysfunction with caution when patients with severe liver disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medications , which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm ratio ) are available methods to determine active concentration .
ast@@ ase should be set to duration 27 if a skin rash is accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ tive factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with related met@@ abolic disorders .
it was shown that R@@ if@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes an 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to resistance development .
508 % increase , for C@@ max is increased by 30 % if R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which have been reached twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ er@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dos@@ ing dosage for the simultaneous adoption of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to close @-@ out monitoring , as the efficacy and corruption of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ ven@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ ca@@ r is not recommended as exposure to both proteins .
if these drugs are applied together , caution is advis@@ able ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be made , as an accurate forecast effect of the effect of the combination of am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r and R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , R@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in is required along with a@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in along with a@@ if@@ ab@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available .

in a clinical study , in the R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous c@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ batch intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
for the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae along with a@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alisation R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous adoption of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ ol plus 1,0 mg No@@ re@@ th@@ ind@@ ron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ br@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied according to the possible use of the potential for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats who was administered in the uter@@ us to the end of the halt in the uter@@ us until the end of the nursing season , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during feeding .

in case of over@@ dose , the patient may be observed on signs of in@@ tox@@ ication ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures .
the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) , as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration camp ( IC@@ 50 ) is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.0@@ 8 µ@@ M in acute cells and amounts to 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M for chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice @-@ versa , Am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data should be considered as anticipated by PI in pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ approved &quot; ast@@ ase . &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ ber@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active components during the dos@@ ing concentration in the Ste@@ ady State above the range from C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss ..

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ ull@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inhal@@ ation is 14 % lower than capsule ; hence , A@@ generic Cap@@ sules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram base ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should take as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for chor@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ blown avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dose @-@ recommended dosage for simultaneous use of as@@ su@@ ase solution for use and low do@@ si@@ zed R@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient arms can be avoided .
although a dose of dose is not required for am@@ bus@@ avi@@ r is contra@@ indicated for patients suffering from kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl reaction in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure contra@@ indicated .
simultaneous adoption can lead to a competent inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects like heart rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection , and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generic ase does not prevent risk from HIV to other by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medications , which may cause serious or life @-@ threat@@ ening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm ratio ) are available methods to determine active concentration .

the application sti@@ ff@@ ness and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of the treatment of Al@@ dar@@ a up to a maximum of 16 weeks per week . • In case of small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ omas , it is five weeks a week , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week .
the cream is fertili@@ zed in front of the sleeping area on the affected skin surfaces so that they have sufficient long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
principal indi@@ k@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete breakdown of treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks or al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete removal of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo in all four major studies , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients treated with placebo patients showed a complete reduction rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a treated compared to 0 % to 3 % in placebo group .

treatment of bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or reactions take back after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical results of the therapy can be judged according to the treatment of treated skin about 12 weeks after completion of treatment .
since there is no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be drawn in deliber@@ ation at super@@ fi@@ dential Bas@@ al@@ cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the use of pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours is not recommended .

the available data on the ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ osis on fore@@ arms and hands will not support effectiveness in this use case , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take place during the therapy of intensity or go back after dis@@ closure of the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin reactions are causing big dis@@ comfort or very strong , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
from data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - les@@ ions had a lower complete healing rate compared to patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution when patients who obtain an immune supp@@ ression treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither one has been achieved after one time after several particular top@@ ical application of qu@@ anti@@ fied serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the nursing time .
the most frequently used and likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in connection related side effects were local reactions on the site of the treatment ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the most commonly reported and probably reported as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application place with a frequency of 2@@ 8,1 % .
the Phase III reported side effects reported from 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III .
the most common , probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream in connection with the application was a reaction to application place ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
the side effects that were treated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
according to the evaluation of the clinical signs , the clinical signs indicate that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ tr@@ ation / ab@@ til@@ ation ( 23 % ) and est@@ ates ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the review , the evaluation of the clinical signs indicate that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is very common to severe investig@@ ators ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and a heavy cor@@ p@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials of investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the acci@@ dental recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia , and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was standardized in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , standardized according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , the top@@ ical application of the alpha inter@@ fer@@ ine and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 piv@@ ot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of inc@@ lin@@ ation in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment can be superior to a placebo treatment for 16 weeks .
at 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients , the F@@ eig@@ n had cured completely ; this was at 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five time application per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed to produce single primary super@@ fiz@@ ielle base cell car@@ cin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data shown from an open , un@@ controlled trial study after four years of present data shows that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) were clin@@ ically ha@@ iled for 48 months .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ ot@@ ics , not hyper@@ troph@@ ic AK@@ - les@@ ions within a co@@ hes@@ ive 25 c@@ m2 wide treatment area than on the hair@@ less scal@@ p or in the face .
follow @-@ up dates from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical studies after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external fail@@ ures , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , and therefore were not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was investigated in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies at the age of 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ ag@@ ios@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks )
a minimum system@@ ic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and bet@@ gen 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml when applying in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ value period was about 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ tention of the drug in the skin .
the data on the system@@ ic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low in the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to the healthy adult and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fiz@@ iel@@ lem bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study to paint tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly lower body weight and increased sp@@ leen weight ; another four months long @-@ long study of the application revealed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study to car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice had induced no tum@@ ors at the application of three days a week .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , is a risk for human beings due to the system@@ ic exposure .
the tum@@ ours were treated in mice in mice produced with the nutri@@ ent @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger quantities than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

in the study mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , but it was also measured by its effectiveness in terms of reducing G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver .
in children under five years of age Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the g@@ ag concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children demonstrated a normal liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , stomach pain , skin rash , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion agency .
very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ ometer ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied heavily sensitive to patients ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will examine all new information that may be known possibly , and will update this abstract if required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is treated patients who observe Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in response to in@@ fusion and development of anti@@ bodies .
in June 2003 the European Commission issued the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for the long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a sample @-@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifestation of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases .
initial content rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in individual steps increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any related side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational equipment will be available immediately .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form nearly all patients of Ig@@ G anti@@ bodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment .
patients that develop anti@@ bodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) .
because little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a prolonged inter@@ ruption must be careful due to the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the start of the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re ) to minimize the potential occurrence in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of an easy or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shall be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering .
the in@@ fusion can be resumed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate that the reaction has occurred once more .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the rate of in@@ fusion of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate occurred in which the previous reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or pro@@ c@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference using in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
experimental studies do not leave directly or in@@ directly harmful effects on pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns , which was exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , native to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , it is recommended to breast@@ feeding the treatment with al@@ dur@@ y@@ me .
the effects of clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which have been observed in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years of treatment ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
undes@@ irable drug actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older , are listed in the following table following the following number of periods : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respir@@ atory tract and lungs in the history , there were also heavy reactions on , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and facial ( see section 4.4 ) .
children &apos;s undes@@ irable medicines in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported in a phase 2 @-@ year study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with a greater severe injury and treatment duration up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients showed it within 3 months after the treatment of a nap@@ oc@@ on@@ version , with patients aged under 5 years with a severe violation of patients ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or to a premature withdrawal from the study ) there were no anti@@ bodies to be found by Radio@@ immun@@ op@@ itors ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say pro@@ vable anti@@ bodies , among them 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ ok@@ on version .
patients with lack of low anti @-@ antibody mirror referred to a robust reduction in the G@@ ag @-@ fried in Har@@ n while patients with high antibody tit@@ ers had a variable decrease of g@@ ag in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal to low @-@ neutr@@ alizing the effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ ag in the har@@ n .
the presence of anti@@ bodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undes@@ irable drug reaction , even if the occurrence of unwanted medicines typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G @-@ anti@@ bodies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cause of the enzyme is situated in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated subsi@@ dies and preventing further accumulation of the enzyme . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed from the cycle and recorded by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were random@@ ised in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients ranged from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ c@@ tioned exp@@ ir@@ onic volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closures in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated to the placebo group a improvement of lung function and tra@@ ce@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me Group , as from the following table works .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically significant and absolute lung volumes increased further propor@@ tion@@ ately to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with hep@@ at@@ oplast@@ y prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of the G@@ ag mirrors in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant until the study .
in relation to the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease @-@ manifestation between the patients that summar@@ izes the clin@@ ically significant changes in the 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , movement zone of the shoulder case Ah@@ i and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients were examined at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years ( 16 patients with severe contamination form and 4 with the medium density form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Spiegel in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients , a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for these age group ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the mean displac@@ ement of a normal mental speed which could only be limited to the previous patients with severe contamination @-@ form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study , investigations of pharmac@@ ological effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may have patients who have trouble with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two doses are equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate every new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the product &apos;s features will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in elderly and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) if the cancer is not removed ( drug against cancer ) , or is likely to spread to other parts of the body , or spreads easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not strike the c@@ SCC cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously were not treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously had already received other chem@@ o@@ therapies than any therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should be used during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injection of vitamin B12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , should be given before or after the gift from C@@ is@@ plat@@ in addition to a &quot; anti @-@ plat@@ e@@ um &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( in order to prevent fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood picture changes or during which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be suspended , canc@@ eled or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active effect in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , A@@ lim@@ ta was investigated in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that previously had been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) and both in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were observed an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9,3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
in patients who previously had received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients in which cancer did not attack the c@@ SCC epithel@@ ial cells , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to compar@@ ative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission published Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle of a bottle has to be added with 4,@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding model of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ oral cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic col@@ o@@ idal bron@@ ch@@ oral cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F for a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ ial car@@ cin@@ oma after previous years , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the reduction in the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , and on the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third party cycle .
in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a full blood picture should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and a thro@@ cy@@ tes .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course a dose @-@ examination must be held under control of the N@@ adi@@ m of blood or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the forec@@ asted therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients need to be treated according to tables in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in .
these criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 blood flow .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity by Grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient value the value before treatment
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if patients after 2 dose reductions or non @-@ ha@@ mat@@ ological tox@@ icity 4 or 4 occurs or so@@ - at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials have no evidence that at the age of 65 years , or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 , an increased by @-@ risk @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , based on in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go beyond the dose of dose adjustments for all patients recommended .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ asing value of &gt; for the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( if availability of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied specifically in the studies .
patients need to be monitored in relation to the button supp@@ ression of the button and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients , before the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ts and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ atic tox@@ icity as they have been observed in the preceding cycles . ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ ological tox@@ icity such as ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ rop@@ en@@ ie has been noticed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B12 as proph@@ etic lac@@ tic measure ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium @-@ kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ ic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) must avoid at least 2 days before therapy , the day of therapy and mind@@ less ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must have to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ value for at least 5 days before therapy , in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients who compet@@ ed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid buil@@ du@@ p in trans@@ cellular space should be drow@@ ned before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 severe cardi@@ ovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ ascular events have been reported occasionally in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ed vital substances ( except for yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn to take advice regarding the sper@@ mac@@ on@@ serv@@ ation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of an increased response of side effects .
therefore , caution is advis@@ able if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are used in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ less than 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data relating to the interaction potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the balance status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data to use P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ abol@@ ites , if used in pregnancy , serious birth defects are expected .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful deliber@@ ation of the use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage of the re@@ productive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment begins , advis@@ ing on the Sper@@ mac@@ on@@ ser@@ vie@@ - lock@@ out .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in the breast milk passes and unwanted effects in the gest@@ ill@@ ful inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the audit medi@@ ation ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statist@@ ically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) against the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms have improved through improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / c@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time in the check .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring is ranging from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without the pro@@ - du@@ kt@@ able quality .
it is used for overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take all@@ i and take no weight loss after 12 weeks , should turn to their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , they can not build some fats in the food , thus avoiding a quarter of the fats added to the intest@@ ine .
in a third study , all@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had all@@ i 60 mg of income , had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking of placebo .
in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss for the patient could be observed .
the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are oc@@ clu@@ ded spots at the After , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with chair , gre@@ asy , gre@@ asy st@@ ains ( threads ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied to patients that are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the transplan@@ tation of transplan@@ t patients ) or medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used further in patients suffering from the long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which does not suffer enough nutrients from the digest@@ ive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver illness ) , and during pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited to provide permission for the marketing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fet@@ tre@@ du@@ ated diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and yo@@ ungst@@ ers under 18 , since there are not sufficient data for efficacy and safety .
however , since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal , in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adaptation of dosage is necessary .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of other components • Equ@@ al treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Premature Mal@@ absorption syndrome • Premature treatment ( see section 4.6 ) • Sim@@ ult@@ aneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ gra@@ ces ( see sections 4.5 and 4.8 )
the probability of she@@ ar gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fet@@ tre@@ ich@@ er diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes with an improved met@@ abolic control may take patients who consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ abe@@ tic should be adjusted .
patients who are all@@ i as well as medicines for hypertension , or increased cholesterol , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dos@@ ing of this medicine must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ation contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent the case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study to inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a reduction of Cic@@ lo@@ por@@ in plasma plasma .
in case of application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( internationally norm@@ alized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) .
in most patients that were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E , and K as well as of beta car@@ ot@@ ins were used in the norm range .
however the patient should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin ( see section 4.4 ) before bed@@ time .
following the gift of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , at a limited number of healthy volunteers , at the same time Or@@ list@@ at received a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration .
experimental studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and depend on the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption is prevented from abnormal fat .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily .
the number of frequencies are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , sometimes ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( Frequ@@ ency on the basis of available data not estim@@ able ) .
the incidence of adverse events known after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at were not known , because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i may lead to conversion in terms of potential or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight people without significant clinical findings .
during the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either side effects or similar effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on exam@@ inations on human and animal can be derived from a quick re@@ formation of any system@@ ic effects that are attri@@ but@@ able to the li@@ que@@ fied properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect places in the lum@@ ens of stomach and upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonds to the active ser@@ ene rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ kre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ sions .
from clinical trials , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , three times daily taken , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ ts is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ ic , fatty food .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of the participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
even though in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss appeared in the first 6 months .
the average change in total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
in the standing volume , the average change was -@@ 4,5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3,7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentration of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measur@@ able 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , therapeutic dos@@ ages not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in plasma are only spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml , or 0.0@@ 2 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients who were administered minimal system@@ ic res@@ or@@ ated dose , two main met@@ abo@@ o , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ l@@ ysi@@ ated lac@@ tic group ) , identified nearly 42 % of the total plas@@ mac@@ ular centr@@ ation .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeated gift , genom@@ icity , can@@ ogen@@ icity and re@@ productive @-@ tox@@ icity , the pre@@ clinical data can not recognize any particular risk for human beings .

Alo@@ xi is used for chemical therapies which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chemical therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics ) .
the use of patients under 18 years is not recommended as to the effects in this age group do not lie enough information .
this means that the active substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy therapies which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemical therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was not vom@@ iting ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 from 221 ) .
in chemical therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients who had been treated with Alo@@ xi in the 24 hours after chemotherapy was not vom@@ iting ( 153 from 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) .
for a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2005 , the European Commission issued the European Commission in Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting with severe chemotherapy due to cancer illness and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer illness .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on coll@@ age , patients should be monitored using an am@@ nesty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection eng@@ ul@@ ously .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is offered at the same gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is extended or inc@@ line to such an extension .
except in connection with another chem@@ o@@ therapist Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy is not used to treat nausea and vom@@ iting .
in pre@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ its the activity of the five studied chemical therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ an@@ ab@@ in , d@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady concentration concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in one of a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( dex@@ am@@ o@@ dar@@ on , c@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , c@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , c@@ it@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ran@@ ci@@ ine , ran@@ ci@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experiences for use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies do not lie , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women , unless it is required by the doctor &apos;s treated doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to follow @-@ up side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that stood at least with Alo@@ xi in connection , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to advance ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar skins of unwanted events such as in other dos@@ ages ; there were no dose @-@ response relationships .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were conducted , however , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for an al@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and 250 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg of d@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously to day 1 without any dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ ous intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ azine , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , were compared to patients that were given intraven@@ ously 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron .
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical trials of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c interval and the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation , and extend the duration of action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ v. @-@ given palm @-@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows a slow decrease in Plas@@ mac@@ on@@ centr@@ ations a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ ating time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the overall dos@@ ing range of 0,@@ 3- 90 mc@@ g / kg in excess and cancer patient dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses there was 11 ho@@ den@@ car@@ cin@@ oma patients between Day 1 and Day 5 ( ± SD ) in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached in 3 consecutive days , overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) was comparable with the previous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the entry of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys , and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over more than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lower dimensions , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elim@@ ination After a single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an imm@@ utable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt injection , the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although patients with severe liver disorder have increased the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination time and the average system@@ ic exposure of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use .
10 From pre @-@ clinical trials there are indications that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the action potential .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which have been given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver disease , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ men ( in thy@@ ro@@ id , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time use , the relev@@ ance of these results will be low for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee for Human Affairs ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the regulatory approval for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C intended for the treatment of hep@@ atitis C is recommended by Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Alph@@ eon should re@@ semble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same veter@@ inary element that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long lasting ) hep@@ atitis C ( a viral infection caused by virus infection ) .
in case of micro@@ scop@@ ic analysis , liver tissue damage is possible , moreover , the values of the hep@@ atic cycle of Al@@ an@@ in- amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene has been brought into ( DNA ) which stimulates the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon submitted data to demonstrate the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy of hep@@ atitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hep@@ atitis C the efficacy of Alph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document , What were the biggest concerns affecting CH@@ MP to fail to fail to transport the CH@@ MP ?
furthermore , concerns expressed in compliance is that the data on the stability of the drug and of the market@@ able drug may not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hep@@ atitis C , associated with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after adjustment of the treatment with Alph@@ eon the disease in more patients treated more than in the reference drug ; Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test conducted in the study was to test a immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ bodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) dis@@ solves , not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( a treat skin infection ) and small infected in@@ surg@@ eries ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pped ) , abras@@ ion and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go perhaps has not worked against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not take care of the treatment for two to three days , the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and reduces the growth of bacteria .
the principal indi@@ k@@ ator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the patients whose infection had been dismissed by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin @-@ customers , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response : when the results of both studies have been combined with skin @-@ customers , about 90 % of both groups were involved in the treatment .
in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go has been observed in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( out@@ filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation of the contrac@@ tor .
the Committee for Human@@ ity agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go has survived in short @-@ time treatment of the following surface skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , abras@@ ion or se@@ wn wounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued the Company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with which no improvement occurs within two to three days , should be considered once again and considered an alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensiti@@ zation or serious local irrit@@ ation by the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the oint@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies of secondary wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin on patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ coc@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) were in@@ sufficient .
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3 day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected area happens .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical funds on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma centr@@ ations , which have been reached after top@@ ical application on the oil or infected surface , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo should not be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After a simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the fla@@ wed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to low @-@ system@@ ic exposure to top@@ ical application in patients Dos@@ is@@ iz@@ ations are not considered necessary when top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a system@@ ic treatment with CY@@ P3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors .
animals studies have shown a reproduction phase after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and in@@ sufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and f@@ lange / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to act as an system@@ ic antibiot@@ ic .
by decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / termin@@ ated , is between the benefit of the nursing for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most frequently reported side effect of irrit@@ ation by the adoption of approximately 1 % of patients .
Ac@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ atives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is extracted by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the effect mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain bond point of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ating anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding agency ri@@ pen@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P relationship and the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ral centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line allows the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transferred to the pep@@ ti@@ dal inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin for at least some inf@@ ecti@@ ous forms should appear , an advis@@ ory should be targeted by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of failure to treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study of healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was filed daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on int@@ ru@@ sion and down to a reduced skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 of adult patients in the years before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual system@@ ic intake of man according to top@@ ical application of 1 % oint@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for PGP in@@ hibition .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was pri@@ med by CY@@ P3@@ A4 , under low shar@@ ehol@@ ding of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ ro@@ id changes .
in @-@ vitro review of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats micro@@ nuclear test to in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at or@@ al dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been reached up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of the human being ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 )
in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic study of rats were found in oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and maternal tox@@ icity .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hep@@ atitis A and hep@@ atitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vacc@@ ines , with a protection against hep@@ atitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hep@@ atitis B infection and ensured that the vacc@@ ination can be led to an end from two doses .
if an up@@ unc@@ ation dose for hep@@ atitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hep@@ atitis C or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines work by bringing it to the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; how it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates anti@@ bodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the V@@ rix vaccine since 1996 and has been a registered V@@ rix vaccine since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of one out of three doses of existing vacc@@ ines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that uses the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective anti @-@ antibody concentration .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 month distance between the two injec@@ tions .
Ambi@@ rix led to between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hep@@ atitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the level of the Ambi@@ rix level was similar in six @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions and a 12 @-@ month distance .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , red@@ ness , we@@ ar@@ iness ( ti@@ red@@ ness ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ k@@ s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix throughout the entire world .
the stand@@ ar@@ mp@@ ing schedule for the basic immun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice , and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if an up@@ tick is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vacc@@ ines or a combination of combinations .
the anti @-@ hep@@ atitis re@@ - surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ hep@@ atitis ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hep@@ atitis virus ( anti @-@ h@@ AV ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis virus ( anti @-@ h@@ AV ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis virus ( anti @-@ h@@ AV ) anti @-@ hep@@ atitis virus values are in the same size as after the vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ers vacc@@ ines .
it is still not completely secured if immune competent individuals who are addressed to an hep@@ atitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , because it may not be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no more demonstr@@ able anti@@ bodies .
3 As for all injection drugs , the rare case of an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vaccine will always be available immediately in medical treatment and monitoring .
if a faster protection against hep@@ atitis B is necessary , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended to combine the 360 EL@@ ISA units that contains 360 EL@@ ISA units , and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ating hep@@ atitis B surface .
with hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , under circumstances no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift may be further vacc@@ ines required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimum imp@@ ending vaccine , these injec@@ tions should be avoided .
however , for Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected significantly sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , as it may occur following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix was in the second year of a separate injection at the same time , with a combined di@@ ph@@ ic , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mas@@ on@@ - m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients with immune reactions or patients with immune defects must be assumed that perhaps no sufficient immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this form@@ ulation in adults , the frequency of pain , red@@ ness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ry , head@@ aches , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thi@@ omer@@ ic and preserv@@ ative vaccine form@@ ulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ component combination simple .
the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ures on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.7 % of subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % compared to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix had given , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with 3 @-@ dose combinations .
however , the frequency of mat@@ eness was comparable to a pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects , the Ambi@@ rix got , compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects covered by 3 @-@ cans .
the frequency of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and robu@@ st@@ ness was low and similar to what was observed after administration of combined use with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general re@@ actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with the 3 @-@ doses of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , is not reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported on severe side effects during the 2 doses of vaccine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combined hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis C surface , was statist@@ ically non @-@ different .
clinical trials performed at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 and including 15 years were performed for anti @-@ h@@ AV 9@@ 9,1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , in the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
intra@@ ocular rati@@ os for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a compar@@ ative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses ambient rix and 147 received the standard combined use of three doses .
for the 289 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ icity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to hep@@ atitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dose imp@@ lies with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response , which occurred in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix , or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 EL@@ ISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hep@@ atitis C virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface .
in persons , who were at the time of gr@@ ati@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to both anti@@ gens , compared to vacc@@ ination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 EL@@ ISA units formed formed hep@@ atitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hep@@ atitis B surface in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs @-@ anti@@ bodies comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine is comparable to the vaccine in 0 @-@ 12 months .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year is simultaneously given to a combined di@@ ph@@ ic , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vacc@@ ination ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps vaccine was administered , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current form@@ ulation in adults was demonstrated for the present form@@ ulation similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and nap@@ oc@@ on@@ ial rates such as for earlier form@@ ulation .
the vaccine is both before and after res@@ us@@ sion@@ ing by order to investigate any other foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .

the hep@@ atitis C virus is usually transmitted through viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as by swimming in water @-@ contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark ur@@ anium , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus , even if the full vacc@@ ination series was completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / your child before serving both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already infected with hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B virus ( although you / her child may feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those after hep@@ atitis C or hep@@ atitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) .
an allergic reaction can occur through it@@ ching skin supplements , breathing not or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B , an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hep@@ atitis A or hep@@ atitis B has occurred .
• If you wish to have a protection against hep@@ atitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prescribed date of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hep@@ atitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hep@@ atitis C / hep@@ atitis B vaccine with a reduced hep@@ atitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hep@@ atitis B virus ( hep@@ atitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced salary is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection before the end of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people suffering from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you are weak@@ ened by a disease or a treatment in your own body &apos;s own body , or if you / her child undergo a hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons on the vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 S@@ agen your doctor if you are taking up / her child any other medicines ( including those who have given you without prescri@@ ptions ) or if you have given birth without canc@@ elling / has been given or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibody ) has been given or this is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix is at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , except for hep@@ atitis A and Hepatitis B can be vacc@@ inated .
important information on certain other parts of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) once / her child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .

ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of data that has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first author@@ ization of the market , the CH@@ MP has re@@ appeared that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Ambi@@ rix stood only in one member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited because of minor patient exposure .
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete en@@ c@@ ym@@ eri@@ ous or hyper@@ ammon@@ ium cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ i@@ aps - split into several individual meals on meals - swallowed by the food bl@@ ended or administered over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ chi@@ ves ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach ular hose ) or a nose ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a compar@@ ative study because ammon@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of loss , inf@@ ecti@@ ous acid content , depression , irrit@@ ability , fluid problems or flav@@ ours , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ comfortable body od@@ or , or weight gain .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that ammon@@ ium in patients suffering from urea cycle to high ammon@@ ium values effectively prevented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the approval of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients with which a complete en@@ chan@@ gel is already manifest@@ ed in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( in@@ complete du@@ z@@ ym@@ defect , which is manifest@@ ed after the first month of life ) , there is an indication of the use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking the protein toler@@ ance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as with growing and adults .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ine synthetic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ boo is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ synthetic ase deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given patients suffering from swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the formation of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a exists if the tablets does not immediately arrive in the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used with con@@ gest@@ ive heart failure or heavy kidney failure and with sodium re@@ tention and ov@@ de@@ mb@@ ing in clinical conditions only with caution .
since met@@ abolic and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down in neur@@ ons and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cer@@ eb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated throughout the halt ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at least 56 % of patients entered at least an adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic cephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ acids , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ yt@@ osis , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ kre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred with an acci@@ dentally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) during a 5 month old inf@@ ant .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose of dos@@ ages up to 400 mg / kg / day with an intraven@@ ous neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active link that con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ ylene with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine faced with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the urea cycle can be assumed that the sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment will start immediately to improve the chances of survival and clinical results .
the progn@@ osis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was formerly almost always inf@@ ecti@@ ous and the disease himself led to treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with the nitrogen @-@ free anal@@ ogs within the first year of life to death .
caused by hem@@ ost@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium Benz@@ o@@ ate and So@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium En@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients , it came with time with many spiritual ob@@ itu@@ ations or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ent form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ let form ) that recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible for the treatment and some patients may occur further wor@@ sen@@ ing of the neurolog@@ ical condition .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed by phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is contaminated with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablets , 15 minutes after the intake measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ Council were observed .
in the majority of patients with urea cycles or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was shown in the next morning after n@@ igh@@ tly fasting .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which repeatedly were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at@@ concentrations in Plas@@ mas@@ pie@@ gel were five times higher than after the first gifts .
differentiation of the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat had no more cl@@ ast@@ ogenic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either oral ( infants and children who have not swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ es@@ chi@@ ves or a no@@ ble@@ bee .
according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as with growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ine synthetic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ scar@@ bam@@ boo is the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ ine or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if R@@ atten@@ f@@ tles were exposed before the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ o ) was exposed to les@@ ions in the pyramid of the brain .
a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic cephal@@ opathy in combination with l@@ act@@ acids , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ yt@@ osis , periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ kre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine faced with urea is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
on the basis of exam@@ inations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ylene glut@@ amine nitrogen .
already existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are also hardly reversible , and in some patients additional deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after the intake measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ Council were observed .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this case , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat .
if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes so that they can accum@@ ulate the nitrogen @-@ based waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body .
if you are examined in your laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs .
during the nursing time , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because the medicine could go over to breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , dis@@ infection , re@@ orientation , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states have been observed .
if you notice one of these symptoms , please contact with your doctor or with your doctor &apos;s emergency room for opening an appropriate treatment in connection .
if you have forgotten the consumption of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes of blood cells ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ cy@@ tes ) , reduced appetite , head@@ ache , vom@@ iting , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , nausea , const@@ ip@@ ation , skin rash , skin rash , kidney problems , weight gain and anom@@ al@@ ous laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this use information .
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation and container ship according to &quot; specified exp@@ iry date . &quot;
like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and content of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whit@@ ish color and oval shape , and they are equipped with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 If you have conducted laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you may use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken care of prescription drugs .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in same single d@@ ots ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose ( hose , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take out of the container a hardened measuring spoon . • St@@ range a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ules from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest strap with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart failure ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( a anom@@ aly measuring value for the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that are subjected to a PCI is administered a higher dose and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , with the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often had a St@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - when preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year altogether just as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for heavy bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , other mil@@ it@@ ud@@ ine or other ingredients .
it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with strong blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or cardi@@ ac infection .
the Committee for Human Medic@@ ines ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; September 2004 , the European Commission issued the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for the transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ do inf@@ ar@@ ction ) in case of emergency control or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional Bol@@ us should be given by 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased .
according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resumed for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg can be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI is of a single intraven@@ ous bolt of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) under 225 seconds , a second bolt should be made of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitutional and diluted drug should be carefully mixed with the application and the Bol@@ us@@ dose can be administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg incre@@ ment dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , a PCI should be subjected to a PCI ( if with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is too rich and the ACT is again checked for 5 minutes after the second mei@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( replace @-@ 2 ) , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated for 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous Hep@@ arin .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against mil@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding or increased blood risk . • heavy un@@ controlled hyper@@ ton@@ ia and sub@@ acute bacterial infections . • heavy kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if there are PCI patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , most bleeding in the arter@@ ial pun@@ cture may occur , in patients suffering from a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment are occurring everywhere in bleeding .
in patients who are treated in war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine , a monitoring of IN@@ R @-@ Wer@@ ts ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in will be reached before the treatment existing level .
based on the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed to increase the risk of blood .
with the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with thro@@ cy@@ n@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ ists or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ og@@ ents are regularly checked in any case regularly .
the experimental studies are in@@ sufficient in terms of pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .

both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine group and in the patients treated with Hep@@ arin treated groups it was more common in women and patients over 65 years more common than male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding like in Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurs among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone , less often than in groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the point area , reducing hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation of ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation , surgery due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ aliz@@ ations which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ red , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects are based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in 6000 patients who subjected to a PCI .
both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine group and in those associated with Hep@@ arin treated groups it came to women as well as in patients over 65 years of more common events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurs among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine significantly less often than in the comparison group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are listed in accordance with systems categories in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in immediately breaks off and the patient eng@@ ul@@ fed in relation to the signs of bleeding .

if a PCI is performed in the following patients an additional Bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h should be increased .
in the arm A the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered un@@ question@@ tive Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to get a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or either before beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) or by PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk analysis , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ ted sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) to the abdominal wall , th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose levels ( sugar ) or insulin cannot process effectively .
insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in differs greatly from human insulin , and the change means that it affects faster and shorter time activity has as a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin can not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was investigated in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cop@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was detected compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % at is@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ pro .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted , if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ ent@@ is Deutschland GmbH issued a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , using th@@ igh or Del@@ tam@@ us@@ k@@ els or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin @-@ change the insulin requires patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of action , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , insulin charging ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in insulin .
3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ul@@ ant diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia and an di@@ abe@@ tic carriage ; these states are potentially life @-@ threat@@ ening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of a hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the treatment schem@@ as .
to the substances that increase blood sugar refin@@ ement and increase the inc@@ lin@@ ation of hyp@@ ogly@@ cem@@ ia , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) -@@ shirt , pent@@ ox@@ if@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ yl@@ ates , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiot@@ ics .
in addition , under the effect of symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as bedding , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pin the symptoms of no@@ rep@@ ain@@ able should be weak@@ ened or missing .
experimental studies of the reproduction showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oid in terms of pregnancy , the embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin is over@@ coming into human breast milk , but in general , insulin is not absorbed into the breast milk , nor is it absor@@ bs after oral application .

after having a glucose object , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the urine cause of severe hyp@@ ogly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the periph@@ eral glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ eton muscles and fat ) as well as by in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .

in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - T@@ US showed a dose of proportional glucose levels in the therapeutic relevant dos@@ ing range , and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose levels , exactly as Human@@ ism .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast activity occurs as normal human@@ ism and achieves the complete induc@@ tive effects about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ism .
data from the data was obvious that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached , as with human normal insulin that will be given 30 minutes before the meal .
insulin was taken 2 minutes before the meal , it was achieved a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , there will be comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control such as with human normal insulin that is given 2 billion hi@@ ves in front of the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin treatment in the gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - earlier ) before the start of meal was given 30 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
