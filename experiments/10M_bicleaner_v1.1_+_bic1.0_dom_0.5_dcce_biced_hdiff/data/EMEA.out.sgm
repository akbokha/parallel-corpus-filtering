<seg id="1">The present document is a summary of the European Public assessment report (EPAR), in which the studies carried out by the Committee for Humanist (CHMP) to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your disease or treatment, please read the package directions (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you want more information regarding the recommendations of CHMP, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) as a solution for inclusion (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirres thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder, where patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is applied to fast control of increased unrest or behaviour disorders, if the oral ingestion of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">With both diseases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting tablets in patients, using the swallowing of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transfer between brain cells by "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mainly known as "partial aggregation" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in lower dimensions as the neurotransmitter effect, to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol carries to normalize the activity of the brain that prevents psychotic or manic symptoms and their repetition will be prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify, relocating the symptoms, was examined in three trials over up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that were compared to increased unrest, compared to a placebo for two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilized at 160 patients with which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectionsolution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder which compared to increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the symptoms of patients suffering from a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to examine how the body absorb the melting tablets and the solution for inclusion (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection of injection showed patients that received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify were effective in four of five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo rejuvenating Manic episodes in pre-treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses have also more effective than placebo the symptoms increased and were equally effective like Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients), acathisie (tremor), vomiting (dizziness), vomiting, Nausea (dilapidation), vomiting, dizziness (dilapidation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Human Medicines (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to heavy manic episodes in the treatment of schizophrenia and during which the manic episodes had in the treatment of Aripiprazole, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee came to the outcome that the benefits of injectionists in the fast control of increased disturbance and disorder in patients with schizophrenia or patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment of Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">An increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients of 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "with regard to the greater sensitivity of these patients" "" "a lower initiation should be considered a lower initiation (see section 4.4)." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 has inducted from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicially behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing a antipsychotic therapy (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder not increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemia disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are used for hypotony (dehydration) or hypertonia (including aczelerated and malignant shape).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials published a year or less, there were occasional reports about during treatment with Aripiprazol occurring Dynasty.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients were treated with ABILIFY signs and symptoms of late dyskinesis, it should be retired to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggests a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazol in patients with crampfancies should be used in the Anamnese or at entrances, which may be used with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazol in patients associated with psychosis which were treated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, increased risk of death in comparison to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study of fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for unwanted zerebrovascular events treated with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazibox or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients suffering from atypical antipsychotic active ingredients including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There is no precise risk assessment for hyperglycemia-related adverse events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs treated patients that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyphagie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally used with schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, and may lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">As a result of the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study of healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased AUC of Aripiprazol to 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected to have other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, similar effects, and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolism, the joint application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should weigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteases, may have similar effects and therefore should be made similar to dose reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the dose height before starting the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram or CYP2D6 can be given together with ABILIFY together with an excessive increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan / 3-methodxymorphine-Ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omearzol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to inadequate data security for people and due to the concerns expressed in the animal production studies, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics the patients should be warned against control, dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative influence.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events are more common (≥ 1 / 100) as a placebo-relevant safety side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study about 52 weeks occurred when patients treated with Aripiprazole, including a total of lower incidence (25.8%), including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonie and Dynasty, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57,3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled trial study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients under Aripiprazol treatment and 13.1% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study about 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was treated with Aripiprazole, and 15.1% in patients under Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled trial of EPS 23,5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53,3% in patients under Haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study about 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 17,6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase of 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.2% was treated for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for placebo treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazol and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes of the routinean controlled laboratory parameters emerged, no medical significant differences revealed.</seg>
<seg id="70">Enhancements in the Cpk (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporarily and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects, which may occur in connection with a antipsychotic therapy, and about whose occurrence also has been reported in treating Aripiprazol, the malignant neuroleptosis syndrome, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch an unintended or deliberate overdose of Aripiprazol alone was observed in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg. and without death sequence.</seg>
<seg id="73">There are no information on the effectiveness of a haematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that hematalysis is in treating an overdose of benefits, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma integration.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is assumed that the effectiveness of Aripiprazol is mediated by schizophrenia and bipolar-I disturbance about the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor as well as an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1-noreportage and for histamine H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In the gift of Aripiprazol in dosages of 0.5 to 30 mg. a day for 2 weeks of healthy volunteers, the Positest emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of the binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligadone, at the Nucleus caudatus and at the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazol showed a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a week of 52 the proportion of responder patients who were involved in the study medicine was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- Depressions scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled trial of 26 weeks of stabilised patients with chronic schizophrenia showed a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate, which stood at 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study included in schizophrenia more than 26 weeks, the 314 patients underwent a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg) at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazol showed a superior efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disturbance, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeboarding and active controls for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a lasting effectiveness in week 3 and a conservation effect, comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In week 12 Aripiprazol demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania to such as lithium or Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled trial of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazol revealed a superior effectiveness in reducing clinical symptoms compared to the monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled trial of more than 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase, Aripiprazol achieved a remission in response to placebo during a stabilization phase, mainly during the prevention of a bipolar accident, predominantly in the prevention of a failure case in Mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the CYP2A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazol, the N-dealkyness is catalyzed through CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination time for Aripiprazol is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazol using CYP2D6 and nearly 146 hours at 'bad' (= "Poor") metabolites over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients showed no gender dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics showed no indication of clinically significant differences in ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of the liver function of Aripiprazol and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not enough to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated gift, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and the canic potential the preclinical data could not recognize any special dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans, so they only have limited or no meaning for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects of a dose-dependent outrigger (Lipofuscin pigment) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 10times the mean Steady State exposure) and combined incidents in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (EC) at the recommended maximum dose for people).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a chelixasis was established as a result of the precipitation of the sulfate of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazol in the bile duct from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81fold of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gene at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of found concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazol not found more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the gall of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages that led to expositions of 3- and 11fold of the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubuli active ingredient, which promotes the combination of the microtubules from tubing indigenes and stabilizes the microtubules due to inhibition of their deolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of normal dynamic reorganisation of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin conveys the transcytose of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies, it promotes the presence of Albumin the transport of paclitaxel by the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is conveyed by gp-60-Albuminrereceptor and due to the albuminbining protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) occurs in a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by the data of 106 patients in two non-sensitive studies and of 454 patients who were treated in a randomised phase III comparison study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>

<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledron acid in comparison to taking 30 mg of risedron once a day, during 2 months, was detected in two six-month comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease of the pain strength and pain influenced in comparison to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who have been classified as a result of the six month trial study (based on therapy) were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with Aclasta and 107 patients treated with Risedron patients who was treated at the follow-up study, the therapeutic approach was treated with Aclasta, compared with 71 of the patients treated with Risedron, compared with a mean follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5-5-minute increment of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data that proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, plasma layers rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a long lasting phase, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance of the big circulation with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ (1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal eliminationshal time t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and white, with the above 1 ½ -values) probably represent the fast resorption in the bone and the excretion of the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, whereas the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance is independent from the dose 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance by Cytochrome P450-EnzymSystems is unlikely, because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, hydrogen-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearing of the Zoledron acid correlated with the Kreatinin-Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the Kreatinine-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">In this case a light (clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function down to 35 ml / min does not require a dose of dosing of Zoledron acid.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes) in which metformin (a diabetic medicine) is not displayed. • It can be used together with another drug medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin patients (especially overweight patients), it can not be satisfactory with metformin in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfa drugs or insulin, the previous dose of sulfa drugs may be maintained, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced to the dose of sulfa resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">With more than 1 400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was examined; the patients received a combination of metformin with sulfa resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylized hemoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos resulted in a lowering of the HbA1c value, which allows the blood sugar levels to be reduced in application of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift from Actos to an existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylharnstoff showed a reduction in the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study included in the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin, compared with 0.14% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were vision disturbances, infections of the upper respiratory (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to irritate).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients that might be hypersensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazone or another of the other components, even in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoazide (high level of risk - acidation - in blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos within the framework of a monotherapy (with the sole use) is used as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients, where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "October 2000" "" "the European Commission announced the European Commission of Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited for the transport of Actos in the entire European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, curved and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequate (see section 4.4) because of contraindications (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from presence at least a risk factor (e.g. early heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of continuously.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of cardiac insufficiency, weight gain or estrogen, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and eyelids when Pioglitazon is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and existing advanced macroeconomic disease has been carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output metastases (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm) or with other signs of liver illness, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If ALT levels are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the norm range, the hepatic values are as soon as possible to control again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms are developed to refer to hepatic dysfunction, such as unclarified nausea, vomiting, torial problems, fatigue, loss of appetite, and / or dark Harn, are the hepatic values of liver.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of patients with Pioglitazon should be continued until the advance of the laboratory parameters was conducted by clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, a dose-dependent weight gain was detected, which can stir from fat deposits and linked in some cases with liquid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a hemmoditially under the therapy with Pioglitazon a minor reduction in the middle hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pioglitazon in patients (relative reduction of hemogloins by 3-4% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematokrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity in patients, pioglitazon as orale two or triple combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dosing dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch, Thiazoldindions, including Pioglitazon, was reported on a occurrence or worsening of an diabetic macular macular hole with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödems, but ordnating doctors should be aware of the possibility of a maculaödems if patients should be considered disturbances of visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmologic diagnosis should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone marches of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon were treated.</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated Fraktur was 1.9 fractions per 100 patients with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient menopause, which were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of a pregnancy, and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or an entry, treatment is necessary (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on investigation of interactions showed that Pioglitazone does not have relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized from these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive, cyclosporin, calcium blocker and HMGCoA-reductinhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a Cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC of Pioglitazon around 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC of Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is attributable to treatment with Pioglitazon the hyperinsulaemia and increased insulin resistant of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (from present data not estimable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the tower and the refractive index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazon, ALT jumps over threefold the upper limit of the norm range also frequently as under Placebo, but less often than in comparison groups in metformin or sulfonyl harnant.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with existing advanced macroeconomic disease, the frequency of a serious heart failure under Pioglitazon was 1.6% higher than in Placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, rare on heart failure under Pioglitazon reports, however, if Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone marches was randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and more than 7,400 patients treated in similar groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years running PROACTIVE study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5,1%) treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="797">For taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator) receptor-g (PPAR-g)) which leads to an increased insulin sensitive cell of liver, fat and skeleton muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripheral Glucoseversion in the case of insulin resistant.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclazid as a monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the treatment, a blood glucose monitoring (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazon for 69% of patients treated (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled trial of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar were randomised in spite of three-month optimisation, was randomised to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the mean HbA1c fell by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continued only insulin; a reduction of insulin delivery in the patients treated with Pioglitazon was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin (albumin / Kreatinin) compared to the initial results.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, limited to 18 weeks of study on type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction of plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol and minor, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- Cholesterinspiegel.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazon reduced the total plasmatriglycerides and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to the placebo Pioglitazon was not found in a statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol while under Metformin and Gliclazid reduced values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the sober triglycerides, but also improved triglyceride levels, this also improved the triglyceride absorption, as well as to the triglyceride synthesis, as well as to the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the PROACTIVE study, a cardiovascular disease study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and existing advanced macroeconomic disease were randomised in addition to existing andiabetic and cardiovascular treatment for either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazon is quickly absorbed, with the top concentric concentrations of unaltered pioglitazon in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">This basis corresponds to the contribution from M-IV to effectiveness in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8-inductor) or decreases the plasma concentration of Pioglitazon (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marker Pioglitazon, the marker was found mainly in the subjects (55%) and found a lower degree in the resin (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours, and the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">Plasma centrations of Pioglitazon and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and apes after repeated presentation of Plasmavolume magnification with hemmed, anaemia, and reversible hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is attributable to treatment with Pioglitazon treatment in the gestation of hyperinsulemia and increased insulin resistant of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for killing growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of family-haematous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazoldindions led to an increased frequency of colontum.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated Fraktur was 1.9 fractions per 100 patients with Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient menopause, which were treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with Pioglitazone or Gliclazid were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year showed a statistically significant decrease in the Albumin / Kreatinin (albumin / Kreatinin) compared to the initial results.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, Pioglitazon did not only reduce the sober triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial triglyceride level, resulting from a effect on tryglyceride absorption than also on hepatic tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the goal of its primary endpoints, which represented a combination of total mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, akutarisation and reascularization of the leg arteries, put the results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not related to cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone marches of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,400 patients who received comparative mediation, an increased incidence of bone brood for women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the PROACTIVE study, a study of 3.5 years of study of cardiovascular events, fractures were treated with Pioglitazon treated patients, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison mediation.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is not capable of using insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycol) hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured in the study, which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane resulted in a decrease of the HbA1c-Spiegels that pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strongly lowered as with another humanoid.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients that might be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may be adjusted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar (the full list is to be found in the package).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Human Medicines (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane survived in the treatment of diabetes over the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S for marketing approval of Actraphane in the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day if a quick initiating effect is desired with a longer lasting effect.</seg>

<seg id="873">Patients whose blood glucose is significantly improved by intensive insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia-warning symptoms can be perceived and should therefore be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in thickness, brand (manufacturers), insulin type (fast acting, bipolar, long-acting insulin, human insulin or insulin-analogous) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA compared to insulin-animal origin) can result in a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the change is necessary at Actraphane in the patient, it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients who competed hypoglycemic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin, reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or otherwise than with their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling, which go beyond multiple time zones, the patient should be pointed out to take the Council of his doctor, as such travels can be applied, or used to be used or taken to other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the doctor must consider possible interactions taken in the therapy and ask his patients to other medicines.</seg>

<seg id="1435">Since Adyraf is a drug with a low Clearance, adaptations of the dose may need several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical trials can conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Talmirror does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the Talrolimus are usually located in the first time after liver transplantation in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml, and cornated patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">Usually blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used during the subsequent development of liver, kidney and cardiac disease.</seg>

<seg id="1484">Chronic transplantation that was obliterated, broncholitis syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8,57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrospinal and 83% in Cicloporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">Patients treated with Tacrolimus were in 21.7% of the cases in comparison to a broncholitis obliterans compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0,025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be changed on Tacrolimus (n = 13), was significantly larger (p = 0.02) as the number of patients that have been phased by Tacrolimus on Cicloporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute transplantation shot after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%), and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) was larger (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study the incidence of emergence of a bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreas transplantation A multi-central study with oral prograf was carried out on 205 patients at the same time receiving pancreas and kidney transplantation carried out after a randomised method of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initiation dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the average prunction mirror of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">In clinical trials the published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primowers were treated with 155 patients (65 only intestine, 75 liver and intestines and 25 multivisceral transplants) under Tacrolimus and Prednison an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone maragonists, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus that lead to Talrolimus between 10 and 15 ng / ml and more recently transplantation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low hematocritism and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound faction of Tacrolimus, or having caused by treatment with cortisteroids or to be responsible for transplantation observed higher clearing rates.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that Tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized in front of the excretion, the excretion is mainly done through bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients die from Prograf (once daily) on Advagraf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), the systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was nearly 10% lower than below prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform common controls on the Tacrolimus Talmirror during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft gradient, which has proven to be treated compared to other immunosuppressy, are not yet clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has been further evaluated as a positive rating, but considering that safety profile must be closely monitored by the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, CHMP has decided on the basis of the ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs every 6 months required that the authorisation holder should apply for further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Human Affairs (CHMP) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>

<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been so modified that there can be no copies of themselves and therefore no infections can trigger for people.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have to be injected directly into the tumors and allow the cancer cells to make the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defect in the human body, is usually used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company made data from a study involving a patient with the Li-Fraumeni cancer in the area of subtree, in the bone and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had checked the answers to the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the data submitted by the initial documents, CHMP grants a list of questions that will be sent to the company by day.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP opinion, the injection of Advexin Li-Fraumeni tumours has not been benefits for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns about the processing of drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company had not been adequately proven that Advexin can be produced in a reliable manner and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen (inflammation of the nose paths) in patients with nasal muginal swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and teenagers over 12 years, the recommended dose of Aerinaze twice daily is a tablet containing a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nose mucosa (clogged nose), are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found on the blockage of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measures were the changes of the severity of the hypocrisp symptoms that were reported from patients at the start of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and valuate with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms have been in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hypocrisp symptoms except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the Aerinaze's income, compared to a decrease of symptoms by 46,0%, compared with 35.9% compared to patients who were pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed an alleviation of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving Desloratadine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observe at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), mouth drycardiitis, diyngitis (lack of appetite), pharyngitis (appetite), somnia, insomnia, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnia and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be hypersensitive to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against Desloratadine, pseudoephedrine or one of the other components, against repainable active agents or Loratadine (another drug for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze can also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma (high blood pressure), heart or blood diseases including hypertension (hemorrhage), cardiovascular disease (caused by a hemorrhagic stroke) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed as a whole (i.e. without biting them, to break down or chew).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used due to lack of data to infinity and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after termination of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as for long term application the activity of pseudoephedrine can be taken at time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Following the decline of mucous membranes in the upper respiration, treatment may be continued with Desloratadin as a monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze Pseudoephedrine contains, the medicine is also counterindicated in patients treated with a monoaminase (MAO) inhibitor and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasocribs such as bromocripitin, peroral or nasal, phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napkin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective, and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate recommendations on the dosage.</seg>

<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Ageneric gases must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also display substrates of the cytochrome P450-Ioenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width aging with ritonavir should not be used together with medicines, whose active substances are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are connected to the increased plasmaspiegel with severe and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin causes an 82% reduction in AUC of Amullavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to offset the degraded plasma gel by a dose of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often undesirable effects were observed in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Ameravir can be harvested by the simultaneous use of vegetable preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient takes part of St. John's wort, the Ameravirus mirrors and, if possible, check the viral load and suspend the currant.</seg>

<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of Ameravir in the plasma, which have been reached twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Ameravir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosing dosage for the simultaneous adoption of Amullavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, it is recommended to close-out monitoring, as the efficacy and corruption of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study carried out in combination with didanosin, but is advised due to the antacids component of didanosin, however, that the revenues of didanosine and ageneric gases are at least one hour (see antacids below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amberavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose is required twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Evenirenz in combination with ambusavir and saquincar is not recommended as exposure to both proteins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitor and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapine may possibly reduce the serum concentration of Ambravir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased or possibly subtherapeutic plasma gel.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as an accurate forecast effect of the effect of the combination of ambusavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amullavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in Plasmaconentration (AUC) by Rifabutin at 193% and thus an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, Rifabutin is required along with aifabutin along with aifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Ageneric in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma layers could be increased in the case of simultaneous adoption.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamphiavir and 100 mg Ritonavir with 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily led to 2.069times in comparison to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamphiavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor or inductors of CYP3A4, can be applied together with Ageneric ase, possibly interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are connected to these medicines if they are used in combination with chorase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteins, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as ageneric gases, as it can occur to resorption disorders.</seg>

<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of agitonavir is not recommended together with these Glukokorticos, unless the possible benefit of treatment the risk of systemic cortisteroid acic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In case of HMG-CoA-reductase, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, which depends heavily on CYP3A4, increased increases of plasmaspiegel in simultaneous adoption of assuase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma screens of this HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhubaryolysis, the combined use of this medicine is not recommended to amberavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended to increase the therapeutic concentration of therapeutic concentration up to stabilization of the mirror, as the plasmaconcentrations of cyclosporine, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased while simultaneously the administration of Ambravir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, aspirin may not be used along with oral unanimous Midazolam (see section 4.3) while applying Ageneric Midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteases inhibitors may point to a possible increase of plasmaspiegel from Midazolam to 3-4 fold.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Ameravir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatric symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to its low reliability of historic comparisons, there is currently no recommendation, such as the Amberavir- dose can be adjusted at the same time, if Ameravir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">For the simultaneous gift of warfarin or other oral anticoagulae along with agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Normalisation Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or reinforcement of antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptiva is not predictable, so alternative methods for receptions are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">A careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (e.g. Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended for the current gift of agglomeration (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2003">In adults and in children aged 4 and 4, clinical trials have been studied in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were slightly up to moderate, coming up early and rarely led to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">With many of these events, it is not clarified if they are in connection with the intake of Ageneric drugs or any other simultaneously on HIV treatment, or if they are a result of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the aforementioned side effects come from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which Protease Inhibitors weren't treated twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which have been used in connection with the study group than in connection with the study mediation, and in more than 1% of patients receiving laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>

<seg id="2016">Amullavir binds to the active centre of HIV-1 protease and prevents the process of viral viral and gag-pol- polyproteinclusions with the result of a formation unripe, not infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of Ameravir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute cells and amounts to 0,41 µM for chronic infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in human being is not defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral, non-treated patients with the currently permitted Fosamphiavir / Ritonavir doses have been observed - as in other Ritonavir treatment schemas with proteases - the mutations described only rarely.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral retreated patients who have received 700mg Fosamphiavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice daily in the study ESS100732, a virological failure could be investigated by week 48, with 14 isolates genotypic.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypical analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure did not rise inside the 59, showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>

<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance tests, Genotypic interpretations can be used to evaluate the activity of ambusavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamphiavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147A / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations to Fosamphiavir with Ritonavir as well as a reduced probability of an virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation samples may be subject to amendments by additional data, and it is recommended to extract the current interpretations to analyse the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenomenal resistance tests, the phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with the genotypic data for estimating the activity of amberavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have been developed clinically-phenotypic Cut-offs (dividing points) for FPV / RTV which can be used for interpretation of results of a resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to ambigvir associated genesis creates a certain cross-resistence against Ritonavir, the sensitivity of Indinavir, Nelfinavir and Saquinavir but generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data to cross-resistence between Amullavir and other Protease Inhibitors for all 4 Fosamphiavir Resistance, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on five-five antiretroviral, non-treated patients (one of them showed a resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (one of 25 isolates), Incavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), inquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insults) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Vice-versa, Amberavir reserves his activity against some other protease inhibitor isolates; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations in borders which can affect the subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of efficacy of asesase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (100 mg twice daily) and nucleodanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with the lowest rate of Ritonavir. "</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred threeshundred and sixty (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Ageneric gases, at least another PI and at least one NRTI have been included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis posed the non-superiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the period (AAUCMB) in the viral load (AAUCMB) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-undermine threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the effectiveness of ungeboosteroid cases is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18 years, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution was taken twice daily, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22,5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; most of the patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cells of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>

<seg id="2043">After oral administration the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amullavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increase, for Cmax is lowered by 30% if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with Ambravir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of Amullavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in AUC but has no effect on the concentration of Amullavir 12 hours following dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">The minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the food intake, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and the rate of absorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent manipulation volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg) and can be found on a large distribution volume and an unhindered penetration of amberavir from the bloodstream.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of active agent in the plasma, with the amount of unquestionable amberavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unborn amberavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active components during the dosing concentration in the Steady State above the range from Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that have inducing or inhibits CYP3A4 or substrate a substrate of CYP3A4 with caution when they are given at the same time (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of assuase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amberavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amullavir is made from the solution 14% less biodegradable as of the capsules; therefore Ageneric solution and ashase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbase.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also the renal Clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of a renal disorder on the elimination of amberavir and raitonavir should be low.</seg>
<seg id="2054">This treatment schemas lead to Amprenavir plasmaspiegeln comparable to those that are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg ambusavir twice daily without simultaneous appointments of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on mice with amplitudes in mice and rats resulted in male animals benigne hepatcellular adenoma at dosages on which the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to human beings, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg amberavir, corresponded.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatogenic adenoma and carcinoma was not yet cleared and the relevance of this observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on people, both from clinical trials and therapeutic application, however, few indications for accepting clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro gene tests, bacterial infections mutation tests (Ames test), mice testing in rats and chromosomenaberrationtest of human peripheral lymphocytes were included, was Ameravir neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, clinical trials have not observed any significant hepatic toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of chorogens even after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies of toxicity in young animals, which were treated from an age of 4 days, showed high mortality in both the control and with the ambush-treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">During a systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly higher (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including Thymuselongation and minor skeleton changes were observed that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If agenerase capsules should be applied without the added addition of Ritonavir (Booemy), higher doses of aesase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for anesase capsules is 20 mg of ambushing / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg ambusavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application is to be contraindicated in patients with weak or light liver dysfunction with caution when patients with severe liver disorder is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medications, which may cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International norm ratio) are available methods to determine active concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external failures, actinic keratosis and superfizielles basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients, and therefore were not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was investigated in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies at the age of 2 to 15 years with molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks)</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimum systemic recording of the 5% Imiquimod cream by the skin of 58 patients with acute keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks.</seg>

<seg id="2236">The calculated half-value period was about 10times higher than the 2hour half-time after the subcutaneous application in a previous study; this indicates a prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on the systemic exposure showed that the absorption of Imiquimod was low in the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable to the healthy adult and adults with actinic keratose or superfiziellem basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study to paint toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly lower body weight and increased spleen weight; another four months long-long study of the application revealed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study to carcinogenicity in mice had induced no tumors at the application of three days a week.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, is a risk for human beings due to the systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumours were treated in mice in mice produced with the nutrient-free cream, earlier and in larger quantities than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study mainly the safety of the drug was investigated, but it was also measured by its effectiveness in terms of reducing Gag concentrations in the urine and regarding the size of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of age Aldurazyme the gag concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children demonstrated a normal liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, stomach pain, skin rash, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat feeling, fever and reactions at the infusion agency.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), speedometer (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be applied heavily sensitive to patients (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will examine all new information that may be known possibly, and will update this abstract if required.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme is treated patients who observe Aldurazyme in response to infusion and development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003 the European Commission issued the Company Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the transport of Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology under the use of Cho-mammal cell cultures (Chinese Hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese Hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for the long-term enzyme therapy in patients with secured diagnosis of a sample-ysacchariot (MPS I, α-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestation of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with aldurazyme should take place by a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Initial content rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in individual steps increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and for these patients no dosing scheme can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with aldurazyme treated infusion-related reactions that are defined as any related side effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment where revitational equipment will be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected to form nearly all patients of IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients that develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Because little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a prolonged interruption must be careful due to the theoretically increased risk reaction after an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of the infusion with medication (antihistamine and / or antipyre) to minimize the potential occurrence infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In case of an easy or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen shall be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are decreased, treatment with antihistamine and paracetamol / Ibuprofen is considering.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate that the reaction has occurred once more.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / Ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the rate of infusion of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate occurred in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procain, because there is a potential risk of interference using intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Experimental studies do not leave directly or indirectly harmful effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there is no data to newborns, which was exposed to Laronidase, native to Laronidase, it is recommended to breastfeeding the treatment with alduryme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The effects of clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which have been observed in the phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients with participants under 5 years of treatment (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug actions in connection with aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension of a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older, are listed in the following table following the following number of periods: very often (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the history, there were also heavy reactions on, including bronchospasm, respiratory and facial (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children's undesirable medicines in connection with aldurazyme, which were reported in a phase 2-year study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5, with a greater severe injury and treatment duration up to 12 months, reported in the table.</seg>

<seg id="2309">Most patients showed it within 3 months after the treatment of a napoconversion, with patients aged under 5 years with a severe violation of patients (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or to a premature withdrawal from the study) there were no antibodies to be found by Radioimmunopitors (RIP) Assay provable antibodies, among them 3 patients who never came to Serokon version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low anti-antibody mirror referred to a robust reduction in the Gag-fried in Harn while patients with high antibody titers had a variable decrease of gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low-neutralizing the effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing Gag in the harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of undesirable drug reaction, even if the occurrence of unwanted medicines typically coincided with the formation of IgG-antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">"" "" "" "the cause of the enzyme is situated in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated subsidies and preventing further accumulation of the enzyme." ""</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is rapidly absorbed from the cycle and recorded by cells into the Lysosomes, most likely via manosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and effectiveness of aldurazyme were randomised in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study on 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients ranged from the middle phenotype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forctioned expironic volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute enclosures in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open-label extension study where they received further 3.5 years (182 weeks) every week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with aldurazyme treated to the placebo group a improvement of lung function and traceability that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme Group, as from the following table works.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is not significant over this period of clinically significant and absolute lung volumes increased further proportionately to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with hepatoplasty prior to treatment, 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant waste of the Gag mirrors in Harn (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was established, which remained constant until the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In relation to the heterogeneous disease-manifestation between the patients that summarizes the clinically significant changes in the 6-minute walk-test, movement zone of the shoulder case Ahi and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year-old Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the security and pharmacokinetics of aldurazyme in 20 patients were examined at the time of their inclusion in the study below 5 years (16 patients with severe contamination form and 4 with the medium density form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased GAG- Spiegel in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients, a size increase (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-Score for these age group (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the mean displacement of a normal mental speed which could only be limited to the previous patients with severe contamination-form only limited or even no progress in cognitive development.</seg>

<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 blood flow.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity by Grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient value the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be canceled if patients after 2 dose reductions or non-hamatological toxicity 4 or 4 occurs or so- at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials have no evidence that at the age of 65 years, or in comparison to patients at the age of 65, an increased by-risk-risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age, based on inconceivable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary to go beyond the dose of dose adjustments for all patients recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function limit of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminasing value of &gt; for the 3.0-fold of the upper limit value (at the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-fold of the upper limit value (if availability of liver metastases) were not studied specifically in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored in relation to the button suppression of the button and Pemetrexed may not be given to patients, before the absolute neutrophal count again reaches a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of absolute neutrophal count, thrombozyts and maximum non-haematic toxicity as they have been observed in the preceding cycles. (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hematological and nichthological toxicity such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenie has been noticed if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be treated with Pemetrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophetic lactic measure (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium-kidney insufficiency (Kreatinin (NSAIDs) such as Ibuprofen and Acetylsali- cylic acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) must avoid at least 2 days before therapy, the day of therapy and mindless (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients who are intended for therapy with Pemetrexed must have to avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-value for at least 5 days before therapy, in the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients who competed these events had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore patients with clinically significant fluid buildup in transcellular space should be drowned before Pemetremixed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 severe cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events have been reported occasionally in clinical trials with Pemetrexed occasionally, if this active ingredient is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenued vital substances (except for yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage is made by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment - Ginn to take advice regarding the spermaconservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroid antiphic acid (NSAIDs, such as Ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage (≥ 1,3 g daily) lead to a reduced Pemetrexed excretion with the result of an increased response of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable if patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are used in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicyl- acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and mindless than 2 days after the therapy with Pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there is no data relating to the interaction potential as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the balance status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulators and antineoplasty chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Normalised Ratio) when the decision was taken to treat patients with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data to use Pemetrexed for pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites, if used in pregnancy, serious birth defects are expected.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessary, and after careful deliberation of the use for the mother and risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of an irreversible damage of the reproductive capacity by Pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment begins, advising on the Spermaconservie- lockout.</seg>

<seg id="2526">Experimental studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and depend on the pharmacological effect of the drug, since the absorption is prevented from abnormal fat.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporarily.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The number of frequencies are defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), sometimes (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), not known (Frequency on the basis of available data not estimable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events known after the introduction of orlistat were not known, because these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size.</seg>

<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change of body weight compared to the output value (at the time of Randomisation), was evaluated as follows: as a change of body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as percentage of the participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Even though in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the greatest weight loss appeared in the first 6 months.</seg>

<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting, induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can extend the colon collage, patients should be monitored using an amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus after injection engulously.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is offered at the same gift from Palonosetron with medicines which extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT- interval is extended or incline to such an extension.</seg>

<seg id="2634">After the findings of clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation, and extend the duration of action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of i.v.-given palm-osetron in single doses of 0.25, 0,75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows a slow decrease in Plasmaconcentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminating time of approximately 40 hours.</seg>

<seg id="2639">From pharmacokinetic simulations, that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron reached in 3 consecutive days, overall exposure (AUC0- ∞) was comparable with the previous intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the entry of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys, and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosetron over more than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous bolt injection, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although patients with severe liver disorder have increased the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure of Palonosetron, however, a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From pre-clinical trials there are indications that Palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular De- and Repolarisation and extend the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30times of therapeutic exposure in humans), which have been given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver disease, endocrine neoplasmen (in thyroid, pituitary, pannierenmark) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee for Human Affairs (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same veterinary element that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference agent").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long lasting) hepatitis C (a viral infection caused by virus infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In case of microscopic analysis, liver tissue damage is possible, moreover, the values of the hepatic cycle of Alanin- aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene has been brought into (DNA) which stimulates the formation of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon submitted data to demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient, composition and purity of the drug, effectiveness, safety and efficacy of hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C the efficacy of Alpheon was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after adjusting the treatment to the medicine (i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: email @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document, What were the biggest concerns affecting CHMP to fail to fail to transport the CHMP?</seg>
<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns expressed in compliance is that the data on the stability of the drug and of the marketable drug may not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, associated with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After adjustment of the treatment with Alpheon the disease in more patients treated more than in the reference drug; Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test conducted in the study was to test a immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) dissolves, not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a treat skin infection) and small infected insurgeries (Riss- or chipped), abrasion and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo perhaps has not worked against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the skin surface should not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not take care of the treatment for two to three days, the physician should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial Ribosoms (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and reduces the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The principal indikator of effectiveness was in all five studies of the patients whose infection had been dismissed by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin-customers, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response: when the results of both studies have been combined with skin-customers, about 90% of both groups were involved in the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, that Altargo has been observed in the treatment of Abszessen (outfilled cavities in the body tissue) or infections that have been proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation of the contractor.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Humanity agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo has survived in short-time treatment of the following surface skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasion or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"" "" "" "in May 2007, the European Commission issued the Company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the transport of Altargo to the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvement occurs within two to three days, should be considered once again and considered an alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the application of retapamulin Salbe the treatment is canceled, the ointment carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin on patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3 day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area happens.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical funds on the same skin area is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma centrations, which have been reached after topical application on the oil or infected surface, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo should not be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After a simultaneous gift of 2 times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the flawed skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to low-systemic exposure to topical application in patients Dosisizations are not considered necessary when topical Retapamulin is used during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animals studies have shown a reproduction phase after oral ingestion and insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and flange / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy, if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retapamulin is preferable to act as an systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">By decision whether the breastfeeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo continues / terminated, is between the benefit of the nursing for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo was the most frequently reported side effect of irritation by the adoption of approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Acapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is extracted by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a certain bond point of the 50s subunit of the bacterial Ribosom, which differs from the binding of other ribosomal interagating antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding agency ripenal protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P relationship and the peptidyltransferral centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, Pleuromutiline allows the peptidyltransferred to the peptidal interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Due to the local prevalence of resistance the use of retapamulin for at least some infectious forms should appear, an advisory should be targeted by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment in S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study of healthy adults 1% Retapamulin Salbe was filed daily under occlusion on intrusion and down to a reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days to topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 of adult patients in the years before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic intake of man according to topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolites in human liver microsomes was primed by CYP3A4, under low shareholding of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in rats micronuclear test to in-vivo study chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has been reached up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure of the human being (topical application on 200 cm2)</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxic study of rats were found in oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccines, with a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix can only be used when immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensured that the vaccination can be led to an end from two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If an upuncation dose for hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis C or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing it to the immune system (the natural resistance of the body), "how it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises viruses and surface antigens as" "" "strange" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components such as the Vrix vaccine since 1996 and has been a registered Vrix vaccine since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however Twinrix adults and Twinrix are administered as part of one out of three doses of existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that uses the application of Twinrix adults were also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a month after the last injection of a protective anti-antibody concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with six months and a 12 month distance between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led to between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children a month after the last injection to develop protective anti-antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the level of the Ambirix level was similar in six-month distance between injections and a 12-month distance.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, weariness (tiredness) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix is allowed to react to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologks.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix throughout the entire world.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standarmping schedule for the basic immunization with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice, and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If an uptick is requested for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalers vaccines or a combination of combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis re- surface antigen (anti-hepatitis) anti-hepatitis virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis virus (anti-hAV) anti-hepatitis virus (anti-hAV) anti-hepatitis virus (anti-hAV) anti-hepatitis virus values are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective monovalers vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is still not completely secured if immune competent individuals who are addressed to an hepatitis A- vaccination, because it may not be protected by immunological memory even with no more demonstrable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injection drugs, the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine will always be available immediately in medical treatment and monitoring.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is necessary, the standardization scheme is recommended to combine the 360 ELISA units that contains 360 ELISA units, and 10 µg recombinating hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">With hematalysis patients and people with disturbances of the immune system, under circumstances no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved so that in these cases the gift may be further vaccines required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimum impending vaccine, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, for Thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected significantly subcutaneous in these cases, as it may occur following intramuscular gift to bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was in the second year of a separate injection at the same time, with a combined diphic, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mason- mumps vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">Patients with immune reactions or patients with immune defects must be assumed that perhaps no sufficient immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturry, headaches, and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the former thiomeric and preservative vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccinations were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared with the 3-component combination simple.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and matures on a calculation basis per vaccination Ambirix, but not based on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50.7% of subjects, compared to 39.1% compared to the gift of a dose of 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of subjects, the Ambirix had given, about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects that were vaccinated with 3-dose combinations.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of mateness was comparable to a proband (i.e. over the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects, the Ambirix got, compared with 36.2% in the subjects covered by 3-cans.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of impregnated pain and robustness was low and similar to what was observed after administration of combined use with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with the 3-doses of formalinactivated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, is not reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines, which reported on severe side effects during the 2 doses of vaccine with Ambirix, or during the 3-doses vaccine with a combined hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis C surface, was statistically non-different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">Clinical trials performed at vaccines at the age of 1 and including 15 years were performed for anti-hAV 99,1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, in the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Intraocular ratios for anti-hbs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to the month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses ambient rix and 147 received the standard combined use of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher compared to hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dose implies with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response, which occurred in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds after the completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix, or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis C virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In persons, who were at the time of gratization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after the immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response to both antigens was comparable to both antigens, compared to vaccination of 3 doses, consisting of 360 ELISA units formed formed hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs-antibodies comparable to immunisation in the 0-6 months vaccine is comparable to the vaccine in 0-12 months.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year is simultaneously given to a combined diphic, tetanus, azellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccination (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps vaccine was administered, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults was demonstrated for the present formulation similar seroprotection and napoconial rates such as for earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after resussioning by order to investigate any other foreign particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark uranium, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines Ambirix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series was completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected / your child before serving both vaccines Ambirix already infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus (although you / her child may feel uncomfortable or ill / feel) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that cause liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those after hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection, cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can occur through itching skin supplements, breathing not or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you wish to have a protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the prescribed date of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the physician will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced hepatitis C virus and 10 micrograms of a combined hepatitis B virus (hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced salary is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection before the end of the vaccine series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is suffering from people suffering from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you are weakened by a disease or a treatment in your own body's own body, or if you / her child undergo a hemostalysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons on the vaccination can not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Sagen your doctor if you are taking up / her child any other medicines (including those who have given you without prescriptions) or if you have given birth without cancelling / has been given or Immunglobuline (antibody) has been given or this is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not enough and the person is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine is to be given at the same time with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and possible limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Immunglobulinen, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix pregnant or lactating women is not given, except for hepatitis A and Hepatitis B can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other parts of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) once / her child.</seg>

<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients with which a complete enchangel is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete duzymdefect, which is manifested after the first month of life), there is an indication of the use when in the Anamnese a hyperammonic encephalopathy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking the protein tolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as with growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbylphosphine synthetic or ornithintranscarbamboo is the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an Argininosuccinatsynthetic ase deficiency must be arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given patients suffering from swallowing disorders, as a risk for the formation of Ösophagusulcera exists if the tablets does not immediately arrive in the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used with congestive heart failure or heavy kidney failure and with sodium retention and ovdembing in clinical conditions only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolic and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), it came to a slowdown in neurons and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">A delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined if phenylacetate is excreted in the breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated throughout the halt (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at least 56% of patients entered at least an adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not connected with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient, which developed a metabolic cephalopathy in combination with lactacids, severe hypokalemia, panzytosis, peripheral neuropathy and pankreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred with an accidentally single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg) during a 5 month old infant.</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose of dosages up to 400 mg / kg / day with an intravenous neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active link that conjugated by acetylene with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine faced with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urea cycle can be assumed that the sodium polyphenylbutyrat may be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is of importance that the diagnosis is early and the treatment will start immediately to improve the chances of survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of first symptoms in newborns was formerly almost always infectious and the disease himself led to treatment with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with the nitrogen-free analogs within the first year of life to death.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Caused by hemostalysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen compounds (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium Benzoate and Sodium phenylacetate), proteinated Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate in postpartal (however within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonium Encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients, it came with time with many spiritual obituations or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygent form of the Ornithintranscarlet form) that recovered from a hyperammonic encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrat and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible for the treatment and some patients may occur further worsening of the neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized by phenylacetate, which is contaminated with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine have been determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adult and with liver cirrhosis as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in tablets, 15 minutes after the intake measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyCouncil were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea cycles or hemoglobinopathies, according to different doses of phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in plasma was shown in the next morning after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which repeatedly were treated with sodium phenylbutyrat (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the average phenylacetatconcentrations in Plasmaspiegel were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Differentiation of the medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat had no more clastogenic effects (investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either oral (infants and children who have not swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gastrostomieschives or a noblebee.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experiences, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg, as well as with growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteine in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbylphosphine synthetic or ornithintranscarbamboo is the substitution of citruline or arginine is required in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrat, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2856">A more likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anoretic patient, which developed a metabolic cephalopathy in combination with lactacids, severe hypokalemia, panzytosis, peripheral neuropathy and pankreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine faced with urea is comparable (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of examinations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram, sodium polyphenylbutyrat may be produced between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylene glutamine nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some patients additional deterioration of the neurological state may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in granulatform, 15 minutes after the intake measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyCouncil were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this case, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medication over a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (solubility of sodium phenylbutyrat amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">Patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes so that they can accumulate the nitrogen-based waste products that accumulate in the body after consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest strap with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart failure) without "ST- Hebung" (a anomaly measuring value for the electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients that are subjected to a PCI is administered a higher dose and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, with the effect of angiox in sole gift or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIA inhibitor) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often had a Stent (a short tube that remains in the arteries to prevent a lock), and they also received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was Angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - when preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularisation) after 30 days or a year altogether just as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected to a PCI, Angiox was in terms of all indicators as effective as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against bivalirudine, other militudine or other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI is of a single intravenous bolt of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single Bolus gift from Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened (ACT after 5 minutes) under 225 seconds, a second bolt should be made of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstitutional and diluted drug should be carefully mixed with the application and the Bolusdose can be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg increment dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney disease (GFR 30-59 ml / min), a PCI should be subjected to a PCI (if with bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutted subcutaneous (under the skin) to the abdominal wall, thighs or the upper arm or administered as a continuous infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for the regulation of glucose levels (sugar) or insulin cannot process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-ulisin differs greatly from human insulin, and the change means that it affects faster and shorter time activity has as a short-effective humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body insulin can not work effectively, Apidra was investigated in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance glycopylized hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a decrease of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was detected compared to a decrease of 0.14% at isinlispro.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be oversensitive (allergic) against insulin lulisin or one of other components, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted, if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"" "" "" "September 2004, the European Commission issued the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH issued a permit for the transport of Apidra throughout the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, using thigh or Deltamuskels or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of abdominal muscles.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced gluconogenesis capacity and reduced insulin-change the insulin requires patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of action, the brand (Her- Steller), insulin charging (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can move a change in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or breakdown of treatment, especially in patients with an insulant diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and an diabetic carriage; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another type of insulin or insulin should be conducted under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in changing the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">To the substances that increase blood sugar refinement and increase the inclination of hypoglycemia, angiotensin-converting enzyme (MAO) -shirt, pentoxifylline, propoxyphylline, propoxyphylates, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as bedding, Clonidin, guanethidin and reserpin the symptoms of norepainable should be weakened or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies of the reproduction showed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and humanoid in terms of pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin is overcoming into human breast milk, but in general, insulin is not absorbed into the breast milk, nor is it absorbs after oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are listed by clinical trials listed in clinical trials, grouped according to system agents and subordinated according to decreasing frequency of their shewing (very often: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000; very rare).</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglyphs that may be treated with intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of Glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a corresponding person, or by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After having a glucose object, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the urine cause of severe hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially through skeleton muscles and fat) as well as by inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be made faster by insulin-insulin. it is shorter than with hu- manem normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- TUS showed a dose of proportional glucose levels in the therapeutic relevant dosing range, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in the glucose levels, exactly as Humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast activity occurs as normal humanism and achieves the complete inductive effects about 2 hours earlier than humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2996">Data from the data was obvious that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable postprandial glycemic control is reached, as with human normal insulin that will be given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Insulin was taken 2 minutes before the meal, it was achieved a better postprandial control than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin is turned 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, there will be comparable glycemic control such as with human normal insulin that is given 2 billion hives in front of the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin treatment in the gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - earlier) before the start of meal was given 30 minutes before the beginning of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
