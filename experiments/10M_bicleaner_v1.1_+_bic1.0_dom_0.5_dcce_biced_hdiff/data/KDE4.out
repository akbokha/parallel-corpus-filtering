the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by using this lighter .
for more information about the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions you can find in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings Format . open the card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de package ; add @-@ ons . please note that there are more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you comp@@ ile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or . then , you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crash@@ es if present .
you can also reach the module filter ( also folder filter ) in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current work directory to different kind of fil@@ tering .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M &apos;s root notes , for example : document@@ al , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root no@@ od@@ al .
the module &amp; fs@@ view ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the M@@ IME type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; fs@@ view ; consists in the display of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is displayed graph@@ ically with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented in proportional to its size . this size must have the size of the size of the sub@@ ordin@@ ate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; fs@@ view ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of entries in it . according to this , &amp; fs@@ view can be easily identified as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command will be considered .
in &amp; fs@@ view ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation represents a rec@@ t@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have the rec@@ tan@@ gles of useful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rec@@ t@@ angle , which is switched on View color mode , can be either deep for slight detection of the dis@@ appearance or the picture of another file pec@@ uli@@ ar such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rec@@ t@@ angle can be labeled with the various features of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can define if sufficient space is displayed or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ate rec@@ t@@ angle may be used ( whereby therefore a change error by restrictions on the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap occur ) . in addition , you can set the relative positions of the label in the rec@@ t@@ angle .
in case of representation algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is not always adher@@ ed to the size of the entry , and this frame is not always available . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rec@@ t@@ angle is square .
how to split the surface of an entry to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation remains to be left out . here it is possible to establish the surfaces so that the right corner are as square . the best methods in this respect are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing .
you can specify the minimal display area for an entry on the menu entry . instead , an image sample is drawn into the area of the parent single , to indicate that this area is actually covered by an or@@ derly entry .
originally &amp; fs@@ view ; as a small test application and introduction into the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application C@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the picture gallery you can find in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery , a dialog box will open with which you can define the gallery .
the title title page allows you to adapt the title of the picture gallery in a text input field .
the option pictures per line has a sliding switch and a rotating panel to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
using the File Name box , specify whether the file names will be displayed among thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to display the image size of the image you specify if the file size is displayed among thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
to display image size , please specify if the size of the images are displayed among thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog box , place where the Gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be stored .
with the check box sub@@ folder , you can set up a slide or rotating panel , up to which level the sub@@ folder will be included .
copy the original images to copy whether the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
to use the comment file , you can specify a comment file for the labels in the gallery .
you can specify a different color depth than in the original images in the check box for thumb@@ nails .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings offers you an easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML settings are available in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
you can find the media playback for the navigation area in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu in the navigation area or with the F@@ 9 key area .
to play , click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media reproduction .
browser recognition add a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , with which you can change the browser and operation system for individual domains . this is helpful to web pages that allow access to specific bro@@ wsers .
the standard browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ; ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you are looking forward to a website that is denied access to this browser , change the browser recognition into one of the following options .
changes in MS@@ IE for pages that refuse to access bro@@ wsers on the basis of Moz@@ illa . for example , you need MS@@ IE browser detection to call up with the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages , which correspond to the W@@ 3C standard , or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the purpose of this out@@ dated browser .
this option is used to use browser recognition for all pages of the site you just visit .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information on the used browser and the operating system in the single menu .
with this &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; module , you verify your &amp; CSS ; instructions and &amp; HTML ; -@@ documents on accordance with the recommendations of the W@@ 3C and other standards .
the module &apos;s website check in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under ex@@ tras . you can make the following tests :
with the &amp; HTML ; check check if your &amp; HTML ; -@@ Document of the syntax of &amp; HTML ; matches , all found errors are displayed . with this examination you can make sure your pages are displayed correctly by all bro@@ wsers .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera head will be provided to you with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ p@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ous ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a fast image processing with basic image tools . you can use them to review and correct your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . editing capabilities can be extended easily with KDE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ous ; easy to use is it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color administration workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; on the camera or lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ ous ; an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of the end user . you should therefore have problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; attempts to make the mil@@ king of problems or improvement suggestions as easily as possible for them . if you use this link , your web browser will open a page in error reporting system . all required information are listed here . follow only the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; is a project supported by a community . i.e. , users and developers have to help each other . if you are interested in a regular user of &amp; digi@@ came , we would like to answer any other users of &amp; digi@@ al ; in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ ous .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ous ; registration in the developer mailing list . instruction to register in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
if you have &amp; digi@@ ous ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply specify a local , remote or remote directory . simply click on the folder icon folder to select a folder .
in the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; you will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ z library . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the upper@@ most folder , the images contains , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ plug has changed as an album . no picture gets changed as an album . during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator as this :
&amp; digi@@ ous ; dur@@ al recur@@ sive the library path in its whole depth . you can not exclu@@ de sub@@ folders , unless it is in pet@@ ri@@ fied folder . this you can insert an unusual &amp; digi@@ ous file . this you can insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will not take pictures as symbols . this will then be used as an album icon . this will then be used as an album icon . more details can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ ous ; you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ dat@@ ei@@ a : if you &apos;re using the raw mode of your camera , you can also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help pipe support .
how to set up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ ms and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera head will be provided to you with your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ p@@ . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , every medium and every card reader is supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ ous ; working together .
modern digital cameras distinguish themselves through the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera will then be used as a disk drive . older cameras can be used as a disk transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; used the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras , which has a continuously increasing number of cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional driver .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transfers the serial port slowly , this connection is now out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ p@@ pled , this connection is supported by g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to be able to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am reliably . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not have any thumb@@ nails or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ ous ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plug@@ ins interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ous ; the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s much easier , &amp; digi@@ ous ; by writing a small module to complement a function as the changes in &amp; digi@@ al came ; even implement .
to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either switch the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
moving and shut@@ down from pictures can work anywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the tree line , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or in another application window . the only restriction is that a picture is not in keywords , file list or search .
- a file selection allows you to extract the wid@@ est : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , Movies and Audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbolic view . thus , the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is displayed with symbol view . which fields are displayed in the dialog of the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . these albums can be saved in a single Alb@@ umb@@ um . these albums can be saved in one single album , where the album was first created , sorted by the album first , and the date can be changed in the album &apos;s properties .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into one album . you can also scan an image photo directly to an album . select the album import photo .
to copy or move a picture from another album to another , you may move the photo with the mouse to move or copy there . in the then appearing menu , you may select whether the image will move or copy there . simply select all photos and move it to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the Alb@@ um@@ properties allow you to include information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , you must click on the album and edit the album Add @-@ Properties in the context menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - Colle@@ ctions : are a method that you can be group@@ ed under a common name , so you can select or delete records from your collection . if you want to add or delete new collections from the tool@@ bar , you can add or delete new collections from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make it in the settings for collections .
the album date : will be used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons el@@ dest , average , new : this place the date on the oldest , the latest picture or the average of the album . if this fails , the average of the images will be used from their EX@@ IF data . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first came out an album in &amp; digi@@ al , the first picture is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is supposed to help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click on the picture with the right mouse button , and in the context menu &amp; quot ; as an album show squ@@ ot ; select . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
an album can always be only included in a collection and collections cannot be em@@ ailed .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My keyword in the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can always use all the photos of the album . you can , of course , use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lu@@ pin buttons in tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time you have to wait in short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided in which you can re@@ produce in the menu Extras all thumb@@ nails .
information on each image are displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this are , you can change through settings digi@@ al ; select the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help on a picture . the help shows a moment to rest on a picture . the help shows the most important features , including all the keywords of a picture . the screen shot in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
photos are all the wor@@ ries about &amp; digi@@ al ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it works . you can reach all the features that are done with &amp; digi@@ al ; you can reach the menu @-@ menu of preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between viewing the pictures , a di@@ mp@@ au or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image processing with a photo by calling either F4 image ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and select ... select . in the section digi@@ al ; image processing can be found in the section . you can view and change your photos with the image processing .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ plug came ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button , and how to adapt it to the file type , and how to adapt it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should be aware that after editing other picture processing programs , you can &apos;t save problems with the metadata in the picture . some programs do not store this data using the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug has two options available to turn . the easiest is to select and select the right mouse button on preview and rotate . in the lower menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can click on the preview button and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ ti@@ f , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo of &amp; digi@@ al ; delete it in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F8 picture del@@ e@@ tion or del@@ f if you prefer to delete it , you can use it by taking Shift ; unlock .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ ous ; used either the EX@@ IF date or if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the data sheet below , so that you can only see the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords are provided a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos . tags are st@@ icker that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
when a keyword is selected , all the photos which are marked with this keyword are displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hier@@ arch@@ ical tree . you can also organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keywords can be summar@@ ized , so you can find the keywords you are looking for , easy to find .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords are imported from the loss of database re @-@ imported , once &amp; digi@@ p@@ ah has noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ note quot ; or click on an existing keyword . if you clicked on a new keyword when you clicked on an existing keyword , this will become the fore@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword using the right mouse button and delete it . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and then there is a menu that gives you the keyword to shift . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the properties of a sample by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the keyword keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sample quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album look . in addition , you can drag the picture to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
around &amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; s functionality with keywords you have to handle it . this can be done in two ways : once you have chosen the photos , you can also click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ note quot ; . alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button on the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu keyword .
you can add a photo with any number of words . the photo is displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords to assigned to him . in this way , you can create a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the picture was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have a photo with keywords , this will appear under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can open the text menu of the photos and remove from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the words which have been assigned to the photo .
the time interval shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be shifted by this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you just need to click on the lower rec@@ t@@ angle of the drop frame , which indicates the time unit . thereby all related images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . then it appears in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future more .
Neb@@ ul@@ er Such@@ box is a small lamp that will find . if you click here the fil@@ tering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search does not find anything , then the lamp will be red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you can open this , however , you can search a simple search box as described above . you can always have this search here as a live search , which you have entered as search crit@@ eri@@ on . after you saved , he will appear in the list .
when you are satisfied with your selection , press the header OK and the search will be done . if you want to change your selection once again in the search window . if you want to change your selection once again , select the corresponding entry in my search list and select an option in his context menu .
if you select search , select the form to enter your search again with previously specified search information . in case you select as advanced search , the dialog appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found here . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search .
if you want to delete a non@@ exist@@ ent search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the Extended Search will provide you an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ al ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Alb@@ end@@ at@@ database . all rules will be added to the search group or deleted . each option can link to this list with search group All ... , A ... , no ... or at least ... link to this list . in addition , you can search the type &amp; quot ; AND NO@@ THING ; create .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; characterized every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows images to compare by these signatures . the lower the difference between two picture positions , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop any picture . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ er@@ ts the results can be enlarged or resi@@ zed . if you move a picture from somewhere on the icon of the un@@ precise search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there .
sketch : free hand @-@ made color sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ plug ; finds the right pictures . here too , a swelling value can be set .
this rider represents an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ atures . push C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all photos inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your images Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this is then added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Ge@@ o@@ Fol@@ der .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; provides a light in a separate window with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L The ligh@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the ligh@@ table and open its windows . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ al window , you can open the ligh@@ table fast with L Extras .
from the thumb@@ turn , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you can select a preview of the tool@@ bar and perform a look at one of the images , then these are also executed in the other picture . you can also compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to extract quickly from a series of images . if you use p@@ airing from the tool bar , then the two first pictures are automatically downloaded from the tool@@ bar . the right next picture will be shown in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies the right pane in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar images .
of course , normal sol@@ dering reactions work directly from the lumin@@ ary , e.g. F4 or F4 .
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails at the ligh@@ table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
in the lower end of each range you will find a built @-@ in swivel function , which you can click on the crossed arrows . to hold the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images are viewing the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom regulator under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and beyond . this happens in both pictures when you are in the mode pre@@ viewing .
what is a digital imag@@ inary administration - aside from the field of fashion ? digital inventory considers every part of the process of saving , sc@@ ans or digital photos stores a form of digital existing administration . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , use , protect and use photos . we consider to use , ren@@ aming , backup , rate , backup , secure , maintain , maintain , export , export , export and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , secu@@ res , search , syn@@ dic@@ ated and exported contents that have a mon@@ et@@ ary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is determined according to your definition data that will provide information on or documentation of other data that will be managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t need to watch how many photos you need , then use very fast searching and a secure archi@@ ving on which you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you have to do and need to know something you need to have in your system . you must decide whether other access to your photos may want to store or change it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . please note that you need to change to a bigger drive .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location . if you have enough photos , then you will be using sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . , then you will print a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photograph@@ ers have other requirements like ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a great number of all . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not re@@ organise your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stac@@ king handling easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or a guided picture .
we also recommend using the metadata in the settings page of metadata in &amp; digi@@ al ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently select the metadata from the database by clicking the corresponding point in the menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want to change ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ p@@ ouch has a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are of course the most important ones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the real work starts as you should now select any photo keywords , inscri@@ ptions and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that you need the same attribute and then start the value . this makes sense , since you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now deal with keywords , keywords , as you are often called in other programs , or categories . all three syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catal@@ og@@ ical images from another source with embedded j@@ acks , then it will be done &amp; digi@@ ous ; automatically build the tree to the right place . the modified keywords will be done on another spot . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; digi@@ al ; updated as it is followed by sub@@ trees .
the graphics show how different metadata changes . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catal@@ og@@ ize your metadata .
you just want to let most ni@@ ze your photos just see you want them to share with your friends , your family , other photograph@@ ers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look closer it , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the landing place of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing , memories , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence . thus , your perception has changed completely .
for other who consider your photos the title is possibly more important than the picture itself . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about what you understand .
it is OK when a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can also use a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) . if you export your images into web galleries , you can even tell you a spell chec@@ ker . thus , you will have to tell you a spell chec@@ ker for your wishes in writing and / or the title of Web @-@ gallery .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different town without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures , the train de@@ parts the spatial presentation now with a speed of light .
the possibilities to explo@@ it the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already countless in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also re@@ ap K@@ ML files with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures at the reception location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice the copyright to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you what information about the setup page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be deposited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization is used , it should not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( syn@@ onym for author ( syn@@ onym for author ) : links to the author . examples of this field can be the title of the photographer , freelance photographer , or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author field , this must be completed .
publisher ( Syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who is offering the photo . if the photographer has been listed here , you can &apos;t need the picture to others . if the picture is a warehouse photo , here the group / agency will offer the picture here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against abuse . this is a little bit more than basic knowledge of this problem . for individuals , this is only very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ pros this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; this module will provide such a module for stac@@ king processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this type of losses are the same you can pass through traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest conversion company , has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you must be treated this c@@ auti@@ ous and you may not have more than a few years . of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality which claim longer , harder and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years for oneself . whether you believe it is in your mess@@ ing game .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ cos and good recording equipment and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . it &apos;s about the right to select .
CDs and DVDs are very vulner@@ able to mistakes , even if you have just been written just for use . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ atting and the control sum@@ s . despite this massive prot@@ ector they are required by chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that doesn &apos;t work miracles on CDs and Linux . it &apos;s also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to store the For@@ mat@@ war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . please read the media with a description , date &amp; author license and then to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing sters include a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ mis@@ c study
shortly : dis@@ cos stop on the longest when you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . in case of lower temperature changes , the most common error code , SM@@ ART , can not determine that error . some of SM@@ ART confirmed the immediate failure . these are particularly read@@ ings and re@@ location . the expected life @-@ time is between 4 and 5 years .
these are only the complete losses due to over@@ stress . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a black@@ out before you have secured the files , but these losses are normally caused without great problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t make up a lot , this can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these attacks can cause heavy damage , hardware conversion , destroyed mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that contains a part of the energy consumption and it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ bar . however , remember that not every plug line also contains an over@@ voltage .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting against lighten@@ ing and protect the connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of any cable can be used to your computer , you should also make sure that all periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ ots , which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modems and the TV card .
if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for traveling .
while over@@ voltage is protecting your system for smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a break @-@ free power supply .
in addition to protection from over@@ ten@@ sions , these devices can automatically make battery energy when a power failure happens . some models allow them even further to work until the current runs . if you have a UPS , you should be sure to fulfil the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting .
remember the potential risk , which is exposed to your computer system and compare its safety on avoid@@ ance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; it is only a small price difference if you think it is safe to keep your computer with it . finally , you should always remember to tr@@ ash all cables before you enter the holidays .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
in comparison to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost and dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost and dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions therefore only occur as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but it is no general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality .
data backup is very safe . transfer errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer is secure and a partially distributed memory . thus they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one to transfer error . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integ@@ rates between operating system and hard disk .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection in your computer . nobody seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are a further source of transfers , since they generate inter@@ fer@@ encing within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle turn@@ out at lower level and is highly scalable . we can only hope that it is available soon for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English too .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data losses in the notebook and 46 % in the job operating systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most often think . it leads to lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the pre @-@ trial process during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely stored before the problem came up , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistake are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings away from fundamental physical limits . this means that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras operate in the direction of 10 meg@@ apixel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk will be responsible for 100 &amp; euro today . so , if you do not have any other data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . thus , backup your data frequently as the re@@ installation of your operating system , replacing disks or size change of hard drives .
suppose you have daily your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , lightning beats if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget Aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally concern a whole room or complete house .
therefore , deser@@ ving is always a not local saving . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs into the neighboring house , in your office or something like that .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
secure backup : a complete backup of all files must be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differenti@@ ate .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files changed since the last backup . it creates several snap@@ shots . you can re@@ produce the original status at any time at which one such f@@ use has been made . this backup comes with a delay system on the next one with the exception that it is only ex@@ tri@@ mm@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only changed the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to enhance safety via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media .
this approach enables you enough time to detect and restore loss . at the same time , you come to safegu@@ ard but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . at the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for every month . any additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file , IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , res@@ ume images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , view@@ points , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the interval of you really interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be respected :
since the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you have to consider everything that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other way to let yourself be in@@ compatible with caution . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easier it is the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use and switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available nowadays for everyone . if so , if you have an old system , it is important to read your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and secure technology , or change your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the reference to change a system in its size . this is actually increasing .
let &apos;s go out that you have put the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move to a new record :
check the d@@ mes@@ g command , whether your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; part@@ ed re@@ size / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ B ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS and dollar ; resi@@ li@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is able to read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format which disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF . it can save much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , but not as many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IFF needed and a slow compression has . this format we would like to save your pictures .
T@@ IFF was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression sal@@ g@@ m ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , there is a problem that this format has been adapted to many people . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open @-@ image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is already available on the T@@ IFF / EP format and is oblig@@ ated for use of metadata . a hand@@ ful of Cameroon is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also be used .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is allowed with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photograph@@ ers move it before an original of your photo , mostly in the raw format , where it stores the metadata separately from the image file . therefore , it can be noted if you use D@@ NG as container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application for use and modelling work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connection and educational efforts to achieve a far reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the images are on the camera , you can use it as a temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
for a fin@@ alized editing , you can use external programs . if you want to re @-@ edit the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ al ; you should then add the metadata . these were cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . simply export it into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ al ; you can find a description as you already have on your hard disk . but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Alb@@ end@@ at@@ database .
to use your digital camera and digi@@ plug ; you connect it to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a fer@@ tig -@@ indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails will appear . if this is the case , the file name and a symbol of file access for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page bars and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras don &apos;t have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer &apos;s remark , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ al ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all photos . this download the photos from their camera into one album in &amp; digi@@ p@@ on . in the download the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures will be downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the button download and then read off . the button Aus@@ gewählte is as long as you have chosen .
if your camera supports this , one option is new available . these pictures were not yet marked by &amp; digi@@ al . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the front window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded .
when you can download the buttons all or chosen , a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored , displayed in the section My albums , then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after choosing the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug came ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all at once by del@@ eting the button . if you only want to delete the delete , you must first select it first and delete it from extin@@ ction .
please note that there are no possibility to restore the photos from the camera , they will not be deleted if you want to delete the photos successfully in a &amp; digi@@ al ; you should carefully check it out from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera memory , you should make it easier to delete the camera memory , as this is much faster .
cameras are frequently used as a file name for the photos frequently . the fil@@ en@@ ames are often used again , after charging the photos from the camera . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate in the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for dat@@ est@@ ates . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day .
the options During the broadcast opens three more options which will be done before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields are copied . with the latest option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option to read date &amp; time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in lower@@ case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ ous ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name displayed on the camera . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera for time points of recording . not all cameras make this information ready . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo , read .
the automatic turn is normally switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , you can turn off the original turn off . if you want to turn off the automatic turn off , use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the lower range of the window .
if your camera has been made available on the date , where the photo was made available , it can be downloaded and downloaded by downloading . all photos with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras make this information available . in the section page bar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case , &amp; plug came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to disable this option . use the button Advanced and select the option date @-@ based underground at the bottom end of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your machine to your camera is button Download . select then up@@ loading . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you ask &amp; digi@@ ous ; you where the images are to be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to launch the up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted by your computer .
GPS ( Global Pos@@ iti@@ oning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position which can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and that can be displayed on a map . determination of the data can be performed by American GPS , the Russian GLO@@ NAS , European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photographs , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to board an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you have forgot later , where exactly the photo was done , you can send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ous ; users who want to locate a postcard to document the site , or simply document this aspect , it is good to record the position data of a picture .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , artic@@ ulated and card refer@@ encing . the question is actually more than three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last of manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a couple who together with GPS receivers work together . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading GPS data from one device can be made with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel , but you must save these data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic mapping .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ if@@ Tool of Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy co @-@ ordin@@ ates , such as map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; try to give you much control of his working processes as possible . there are many settings that you need to change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; you must select in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; action can be set on set preview or image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lay down the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ al ; firm , if you click an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this page contains , as shown below , the standard did@@ ac@@ ity and copyright data . this data will be automatically written into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , when the option is written to download from the camera file . this data is also written in the IP@@ TC fields .
Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . this field should be the professional photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer , or independent , commercial photographer , must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to enter the photo . this must not be the author here , as this for a news agency such as Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations have to be listed here . if the picture is a camp photo , the group or agency will be available here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thereby , the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ p@@ . these metadata is also available and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ ous ; imported to go without lost .
image descri@@ p@@ ings as embedded inscri@@ ptions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos , with the images embedded in the images . please note : by images that have already been signed , these are over@@ written by the digi@@ p@@ ings .
the Settings page contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse cur@@ sor appears in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ous ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ p@@ es are attempted , you can add the file extensions of this list and remove . any file in a &amp; digi@@ ous file ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which does not have these extensions , ignored by &amp; digi@@ ous ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by press the button Update right from each category .
the settings of the lamp by &amp; digi@@ ous ; can then be switched on this page when you are then switched on . some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can only get better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool bar while you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dar@@ ker or bright color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the color form@@ ations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer statement .
with the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to a high compression . this means a high compression .
with the T@@ IFF files option , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ fl@@ ate compression salt for T@@ IFF images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF images . it has no effect on image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm comp@@ ile free .
with the adjustment of los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files you can freely save yourself . even if you have been writing the los@@ sy settings , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . as this paragraph , metadata was not yet supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ ous ; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is developing a tool for mani@@ pulation on your photos . this dialog allows you to change the settings of the image processing .
the standard im@@ itate is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option for ultra@@ violet light , this is a bit soft , elimin@@ ates this difference with minimal loss of details . this option shows a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the whit@@ ening is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white @-@ off is not set . standard , it is a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps will get more details into the top lights . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your images are being burned down , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the Spitz@@ lich@@ ter in the settings . lastly , you can re@@ locate some unusual results because they are trying to recon@@ struct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ lich@@ ens .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast sati@@ ated like green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ v therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question , how many color or white you want .
if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized to each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ee value according to your taste . you probably have to put it higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ al ; -@@ image processing can be done . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should approach conservative .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image data that have many cameras and which is available to a matrix of color pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; and D@@ cra@@ w made you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homogen@@ e@@ ity ) was the first algorithm created by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenti@@ ls you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ ar as you are carried out during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how these should be given back . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ p@@ ons ; information such as the colour information of a color space in the other are to translate the colors as precisely as possible .
behavior Questions when a picture is opened in the image processing / color administration module with raw files .
color profile file S@@ etting here the folder , such as / us@@ r / share / color / color / ICC or / home / .@@ color / ICC , where you store all of your profiles . &amp; digi@@ p@@ ouch ; examine this folder then during the start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here only your pictures colour@@ fully does not manage the entire screen .
the input profiles should be used to the camera vend@@ or and model you are using . not all profiles are created on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not fixed for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you must perform the tone mapping itself .
there are more options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer has to be given back as your photo as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , instead you can manually adjust to the flash algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious that color profile is intended for what is intended for . unfortunately , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official :
the Canon Profil@@ extension allows the style to recognize : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Ne@@ ut@@ ral , P for Por@@ tra@@ it@@ and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image analysis and image editing ; many modules support , which were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the files you want to use and these modules will then appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you can also see some of the menu in the context menu .
short commands for tasks that are performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings Short@@ cuts .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules you can get through the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjustable in time between the images , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the pictures during the display .
the camera characteristics show a list of all @-@ supported cameras on the left hand side . if you want to use a camera that is connected to the computer , you make sure that the camera is connected properly , switched on and in the image line mode . below are the port settings . currently there are serial , USB@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory .
at the bottom end you can set the path for USB@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / s , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera and digi@@ plug ; you have to connect the camera to your machine to display them in the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ plug came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can manually set c@@ amer@@ amo@@ del and port . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert it here .
with the confirmation dialog for the re@@ location of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can you can adjust the summary of &amp; digi@@ al ; you will find more details when del@@ e@@ tion of a photos and del@@ e@@ tion of an album .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ it through &amp; digi@@ al ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without feedback . otherwise you have to apply the changes to the button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can also display the display &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Welcome screen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screen ; by startup , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; digi@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When you are looking for new photos , you need to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time from &amp; digi@@ al . this extends the starting time from &amp; digi@@ p@@ ah . if something from the base folder has been deleted , you ask &amp; digi@@ p@@ ah ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot; &quot; &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can adjust the main window to your taste . you can select it under Settings Design from the tool bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ al ; you will find more information on this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improve . image processing can be launched by clicking on a preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting entry / Edit menu .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ al ; therefore , they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the image processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , and the current image size is shown .
one menu bar at the top edge and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you store File Save or Save from the tool bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture .
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with File Save .
as long as you have not saved the picture , you can restore the original image by clicking on the File Station File . you will then lose any changes you have done in the photo since the last store .
almost any promotion of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can und@@ o und@@ o by using the Edit Feedback or restore Edit re@@ produce from the menu .
if you often use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ z to return and C@@ trl ; -@@ switch @-@ Z to restore .
if you remove the &amp; L@@ MB ; for a moment longer press the back or restore button in the tool bar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can select and zoom out in the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the box menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t like this , you can call this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ ous ; you can call this from the &amp; digi@@ al dialog . you can call this from the &amp; digi@@ al window . see the section for setting the image processing .
if you want to print the current picture , select the image from the image and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or complete phrases . all image preview pages can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer assist@@ ent . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ ous window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images are available . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation devices , even if one of the five riders is clicked :
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar disappear or disappear into the rim .
in the labelling view , you can input labels with unlimited size or insert . note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs .
the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labels in other applications , you should notice these restrictions .
after you commented it , use either the button user or change to the next picture , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures .
the section rating shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied to a single click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut . to rate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword will display a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; digi@@ al ; session .
the keyword tree is dynam@@ ically adapted to the entered keyword . you can easily restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search of a keyword rapidly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be placed by selecting the corresponding boxes in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the keyword in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword sub@@ section below .
the side@@ bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ as@@ - , j@@ igsaw and search filter from the right side , only the inter@@ section of these two will be displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also pull , drag and place them . if the keyword already exists , you can easily draw on the right side bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is not reduced to three images . they were picked up with Str@@ g + a and then a keyword from the right keyword will be put on the selection and put it off . a dialog asks if this keyword will be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off by settings .
if you have a rule with and create and find that it should be a or be , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and control panel .
( 1 ) : the entry which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key term , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , is already set in the database .
for example , you can choose an extended search over all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows :
why did Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted to &amp; digi@@ ous ; s more concrete implementation .
the reason why you insert a color@@ less workflow , which in fact have a color@@ able devi@@ ation from the actually photographic or scanned colors . with a color@@ less workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor need to print or the colors you print or on the web you publish from your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
if the theme comes on color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons it must express . unfortunately , colour management meets you at any point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , we will provide you with lower information about color administration at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should make links with lower information to make your own informed decisions so that you will receive the desired outcome .
if your frame does not meet all the criteria listed below , you do not need to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on s@@ RGB colour space . ( see further information below )
your only other picture expend@@ itu@@ res are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ RGB de facto standard is standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should you then use another color space and do not have to make thoughts about color administ@@ ers ?
a visual example of limitation by s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see is the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ical region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour space , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to install my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to install your monitor , because s@@ RGB works on s@@ RGB format , then you have to use your monitor on s@@ RGB format , then you have to use your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool displays five automatic correc@@ tions which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attemp@@ ting to move further manual processing .
the functions norm@@ alize , identical , autom@@ ating and contrast from the menu corrected automatic correction try to automatically test your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which seems best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the whole picture above the whole picture , so that the dar@@ k@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest point as bright as possible . this function is often a mag@@ ic correction for images that are dark or washed .
ab@@ same : this method adjusted the fluores@@ cent factor of the color of the selected image so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity is as flat as possible . sometimes it &apos;s a very powerful surgery , which causes either wonder at a picture or it destro@@ ys it .
autom@@ ate the same : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue channel . it identi@@ fies the dark and bright mar@@ gins and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ o@@ gram@@ m@@ range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ance of RGB values of an image by shift the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ comparison of &amp; digi@@ ous ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white @-@ like photos .
the white @-@ correction correction is somewhat limited to be worked as a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can carry out too far from the original mode , in case you can perform the whit@@ ening in the raw mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode can be used , so your possibilities are better to compens@@ ate for correction .
this tool is based on a white ab@@ stain@@ ism of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start the menu entry colors white as the image processing .
the window window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , the original image can be seen as well as the pre@@ viewing of the tool . if you want to see the original whit@@ eness , then it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ anz of the Pix@@ els under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
to the right top , a hist@@ ogram is displayed , as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ines . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . sum will be called L@@ umin@@ anz .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow of alignment makes you improve or di@@ mming the shadow details of your photos .
An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then put somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white ink . on this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set .
in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of prefer@@ ences . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is exposed .. you will see the combined result in white . this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons save as and store doing exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ mount you have set you can store in a text file and later re@@ load .
the Con@@ ferences tab sets all filter values back to their default value and the corresponding neutral white @-@ balance . note that neutral settings will be shown another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the co@@ effici@@ ents per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suitable for high @-@ quality pictures . this coding requires also more turn@@ table , computing time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog such as editing images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour tone mapping can be done by sub@@ mitt@@ ing color profiles . a detailed manual for use of color profiles can withdraw the chapter colour management .
another important tool is available in the menu below colors sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously , so that you can always use it for multiple photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always require the same error . in the manual on the sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problem is the tool for re@@ dation , that you will find below colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool colour effects makes you four colour effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image completed by the additional light . this had the effect that the light , dar@@ ker areas protected by the second illumination . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls solar energy . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase creates a negative image that is not produced on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ety effect that makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try to em@@ bell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth frame structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contrast colors . but also some photo ograph@@ ers , especially those who are barely visible from landscapes .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slide repet@@ itions increases the thickness of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can trigger the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color constra@@ ints and the lumin@@ ance of your photos with the tools in the menu . all your alignment you can be satisfied in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you have a photo at bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a good choice for brightness / satur@@ ation instead of increasing her . all changes you can perform in pre@@ viewing . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lamp@@ shade / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool sound correction to improve exposure . even if the dialog to this tool seems very complicated , you will only need the area of the slide . more concrete the three fir@@ s below the Hist@@ o@@ Program .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s three sliding times are clicked and the left side will be shifted to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls , and ensure that the image changes .
on the right hand the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left hand are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted , if the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic setting is useful .
three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , commonly called g@@ amma values .
the three colour pin@@ p@@ ettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic calibration .
evaluation : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls which can be used to modify the output values as for example , a remote picture can be used as background , while something else can be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values in the fil@@ esystem can be saved and later re@@ loaded , the Gimp level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color p@@ ettes , the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shade , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the Hist@@ o@@ Program for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kan@@ äle .
the option over@@ load indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to view over @-@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you will only see the effect only in pre@@ viewing and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you see an example of adjustment of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module :
in addition to this box , two symbols are to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a course section to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are dar@@ ker and the corresponding image pixels are dar@@ ker .
on the preview of the original photos , a red marking is shown . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change , it will be a suitable line on this line and move it up and move it up until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : you can do exactly this with these buttons . each curve you can have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and loaded later . the file format is the Gimp spa format .
when you create this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes buttons automatically create the curve points for all channels of the shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ curve .
the option over@@ load indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , that means you will only see the effect only in pre@@ viewing and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white picture which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kanal . shadow and sun tones was placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image ( 2 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; channel mixer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixer ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour sh@@ ady images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with the own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram appears to display the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to change these channels as well . if you can also activate L@@ umin@@ anz , since the channel mixer is used to generate powerful black @-@ white converter of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color becomes visible in the same place in the colour canal which looks different in each channel . if this is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first .
the Save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender settings can then save and then download it . the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format .
the option over@@ load indi@@ k@@ ator controls all colour channels to view over @-@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you will only see the effect only in pre@@ viewing and it &apos;s no effect at the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the revised picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as colour images can be easily converted on the machine . also with a set of film roller profiles .

green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all the scenes and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter .
orange @-@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with an orange line filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ filtered .
red filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ est@@ ial effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ar effects on the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ unda .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ iat@@ on : produces warm light and medium tones as he adds a little cold in the shadow zones . this is very similar to the process of failure of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sept@@ a . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool texture apply you to apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mur@@ al image on a wall . the menu image is applied to the image processing can be used .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture on the image .
a paper text effect is applied on the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
to keep the eye of an ob@@ server in the limits of a photos is no easy task . one way to keep his attention is to place a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . under picture frame , the module can be started out of the image processing .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired cream type for your image . pier@@ ce the picture with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , it surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a frame with patterns .
width : width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target screen will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio will have . this is important for the printing of the images , especially if you have used the tool with aspect ratio before .
with this practical tool , you can insert an easy @-@ format text into a picture at any point . this also goes to several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply specify the text and place it with your mouse . if you need to adjust text size , orientation , color from the color space and character set with its features as you need . you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; after the picture is stored once the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool templates can apply a template to a picture .
the template image template uses in the image processing can be used to lay templates via a picture .
for the sten@@ cil there is no limitations regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and to add a maximum compression ( 9 ) to add a file size of the template , please send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; digi@@ ous ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ user @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder in the dialog box . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be shown for the next start .
after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of sten@@ cil printer . the selection of a folder is updated automatically .
below the preview three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlarges the image below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks the image below . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shr@@ ink the picture accordingly . check the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move this button to post@@ p@@ one the image below the template . take the image and lay it on the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; digi@@ ous came ; introduces three different tools to shar@@ pen@@ ed . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very quick and simple , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
Un@@ sharp@@ ness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . they can use it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winst@@ on Chang .
Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing is possibly the best of the three as he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alised images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because of the dig@@ iti@@ zation process colours are combined with only minimal differences to a color . this in turn shows that sharp edges can be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras are normally more im@@ itable than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG pictures , a camera has often been applied to internal sharp@@ ness . images in the raw format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
some scanners contact a hot filter during the reading of the picture . if you disable this , you will receive control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness of shar@@ pen@@ ing . you can call it with the menu entry sharp@@ ly .
but you should cope with careful because the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise of an image the tool . you can easily focus on the menu entry . under Re@@ focus , you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for hot .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to adjust the image a bit soft . use the tool to fix it with the menu entry and experiment a bit with settings . the screen window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter is very sharp , a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview can help editing the image , showing the display of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values frequently produce good results and should be tried out first . if you make the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask too strong , noise and the impression of bur@@ ring will produce close to sharp edges .
the radius appears like many pixels on each side of a channel through the filters are affected . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . they should be shar@@ pen@@ ed at best in their final resolution images .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the linked image that is added to the original . thereby the thickness of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the swelling value is a break out of the maximum of RGB value and the difference amount . this way , it can be used for a channel of filters . this way , areas with a soft change is excluded between the sounds of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , he@@ els and water surfaces .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ c@@ ate was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Re@@ focus re@@ foc@@ usses a picture through improvement of the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to reverse a picture too &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; in which it is used to reverse the picture . it is used to use a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ming . re@@ focus can usually get better results than un@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ sively . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice , the circular saw works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding result is also dependent on the source code which is far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ itting is affected in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels . that causes unwanted results .
circular edge : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should set 1 good results , but if your image should be very in@@ sharp , but should mind on Christmas .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced by the sharp@@ ness effect of the module .
space filter : an increase in the space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values above 0,1 is likely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will increase the image further .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ S archipelago . in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the space filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular hot or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be saved for later and then can be loaded then .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity tun@@ nels on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations made not immediately visible , but left un@@ comfortable arti@@ facts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the un@@ compressed image to the un@@ compressed image .
generally un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results as hot . this could be caused by causing un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as hot .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ quer@@ ade always have to produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed filter . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is always at least just as good as the in@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better with the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture , see :
the original un@@ clear color image has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused results is attri@@ but@@ able to in@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information about the methods of the Archi@@ f@@ ec@@ tin@@ cture in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the kno@@ b of the set makes the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of the range of dar@@ kened to generate a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink content makes a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non @-@ desired art@@ e@@ facts with an un@@ preced@@ ented speed .
this algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ference as starting points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail @-@ keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of details . a small value leads to a smooth glass above the picture . for larger values , the value of 0.@@ 9 should ensure that no sharp@@ ness is necessary . please note that the detailed conservation should always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
guiding depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ther evenly throughout all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gra@@ ins or CCD r@@ ushing will produce a high @-@ shaft pattern . JPEG art@@ e@@ facts are best removed with a value in the vicinity of 1 .
smoo@@ thing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ es@@ . p defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of space in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is necessary , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect he needs to be higher than 3 .
repet@@ itions : specifies how often the algorithm is gone . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle incre@@ ments da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angular @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen , it should also be small chosen , so that small angles should generate a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral st@@ ep@@ per in pixels . you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
linear interaction : use more on quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow him out .
the buttons save as and store doing exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and be loaded again later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take a long time and move a high CPU load . so you can break the calculation anytime with the button closure .
below you can see how imag@@ ery can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module will be applied on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is an in@@ trin@@ sic black arti@@ fact that has been caused by a poor film storage during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ al was a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read these in English in this tutorial .
the screen picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the lower window details and the advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1x@@ 41 ) , which is needed for the filter . large numbers increase the time that the filter is administered per pixel and can scale the image above the image and the color in it is smoo@@ ther and therefore minor bug adjusted .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness distance to the edge of the filter . if it is increased , noise points will be removed , if you need to change the edges . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer be obtained and r@@ ushing , or repro@@ ach .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . if it is too strong , the frequency response can be removed or smo@@ kers can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ e@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ous tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these att@@ itudes do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by details settings .
colour : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these att@@ itudes do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ em@@ oler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which are typically harder to increase . however , it does not contam@@ inate the shadow zones .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acting when it is increased , r@@ ushing and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter will appear on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it .
save below and load : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how smoking can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was used with standard settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution , painting a bit soft , is fortunately enough easier than a picture to shar@@ pen and experiment with the deposit . the display window on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ p@@ ist ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ ields .
this filter to rest@@ oring you gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undes@@ irable arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s sound gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , comp@@ art@@ ments and local mistakes in the image con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text conversion , which is done with another tool , the image error correction , performed by I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ kre@@ ich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG art@@ e@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . it creates some comp@@ resses &amp; quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons save as and store doing exactly this . every adjustment of photo rest@@ oring can be loaded into a text file and later re@@ loaded .
photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can take very long and move a high CPU load . therefore , they can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
below you can reduce how a photo with equ@@ alling noise is restored . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo rest@@ oring . this time , tex@@ tures can be used to see an old color photo created with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that have been viewed by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ light and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image below ( 1 ) can be seen and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel of photos that were equipped with a CCD camera . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by the copyright of Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly with high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression may have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ image sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark picture right in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the corrected image . note that the wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark and re@@ charges this automatically in the next session .
the image area and preview can help you correct the result within the picture . the display window displays the output of the filter with current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all types of action .
select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
average Dur@@ ation : it is an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels which have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel Cor@@ rection on a color photo , from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , used . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ work@@ correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ h , i.e. , sub@@ bel@@ ated corners , an image .
wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can often also illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( shaded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objective highlights also this behavior .
but it has also draw@@ backs . many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used , also with center @-@ filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or less , since otherwise unexpected effects are created by movement .
with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i applies the transformation with a C@@ enter@@ Filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i @-@ Filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light amplifiers at the point of the biggest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or randomly to compens@@ ate a larger degree of Vig@@ net@@ scape , reducing it by a small degree of compens@@ ating .
Leu@@ ch@@ starch , Con@@ tr@@ ast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ stat @-@ correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls provide you only positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fine adjustment of the target image , so let the values for light intensity / contrast / g@@ amma is zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ work@@ correction is applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the adjusted picture in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a lamp@@ shade and contra@@ sting correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ ous is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses in photos . it uses an protected algorithm created by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ tions . color@@ less dist@@ or@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree of gravity has a similar round effect , fl@@ att@@ ens on the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth Gra@@ des correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion almost elimin@@ ates .
general : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the second degree . with negative values , ton@@ n@@ ical dist@@ ortion is corrected and positive values are cushion @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of the dist@@ ortion . this value is more active in the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter is the reverse sign of the parameter General .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thus results in a correction first gra@@ dient . negative values increase while positive the picture smaller .
bright : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrate the dialog with a preview the dist@@ ortion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and the next start as default values are used .
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes . best , do these correction as all first by . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent the fal@@ ter .
to help you find the best correction , this tool will display a vertical and horizontal support line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection you can correct the audio / ho@@ ver@@ ted dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion @-@ like dist@@ ortion , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers from the image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog .
for most pictures the t@@ onal correction is enough . the next logical step for some motives , such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction given to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ulating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left hand side of the window you can select the range of pre@@ viewing . if you move the red rec@@ t@@ angle with the mouse , you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can adjust two parameters for film gra@@ ins and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ ins of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ ins and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in converting . green meadows will know how snow !
since the filter duc@@ ts are mixing of infrared film , particularly the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos , as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the worked picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type of aura at the top .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter Film@@ kör@@ nung is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film gra@@ ins on your pictures . this is of classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver gra@@ ins of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ iny effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to be back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
with the kno@@ b the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated for control of intensity and gran@@ ular@@ ity of bas@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are required , in ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more bas@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film maker applied to a black / white picture . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous came ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two controls to affect this effect . the upper choose the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing the sm@@ ooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the char@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editor is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to produce a carbon dioxide . thus , images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing , so it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to look for you . this would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controls with a range of ranges from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator choose the pin size and the bottom adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon recording filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving marks your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses an protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ous ; filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure in which color is not the most important content of the content . the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ious landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the working image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using dist@@ ortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divi@@ des the image in cells and looks like if it is seen through glass blocks .
wavel@@ ength 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by accident effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : get off the image along st@@ ern@@ ing lines going out of a centre . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera and thereby produces a dynamic expression of the most often found in sports photography .
radi@@ ale im@@ sharp@@ ness : get the image by turning the pixels around a center . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ shar@@ per of a rotating camera .
distance Im@@ sharp@@ ness : get the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
motion detector : get the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing camera .
soft@@ ness : get the image soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or for adding a warm and subtle glow .
Schüt@@ te @-@ sharp@@ ness : get the image by random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the im@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing of an arbit@@ r@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Dis@@ shar@@ ks : finds the colour p@@ add@@ ling in the picture and get caught without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : share the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , by col@@ t with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button .
the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es to your picture . this gives it natural pictures a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected by copyright algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drop . since the size of the image is not automatically growing with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drop . fish stocks change the optical effect of drop in the image .
you can keep using &amp; digi@@ ous ; image processing a range free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the range of tools to keep the area , for example a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ing filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ers turning and transform@@ ers .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo , with minimal loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you zoom into a picture , how can you invent a picture ? how can you retrieve or guess the missing information ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see it here a good job . try it and you &apos;ll see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose a change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is shown below .
the tool for size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating .
many educational programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation for the increase of an image . &amp; digi@@ ous algorithm uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image aspect ratio will be retained when setting the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is necessary , as it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as and store are used exactly for this . each entry for photo is stored as a text file and be loaded again later .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast at what makes it , but it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button .
you can see an example of the picture below by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 2 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magni@@ fication comparison .
the cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ rated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rec@@ t@@ angle , then you will see this rec@@ t@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photos will cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like . you can pull the size of the square by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ t@@ angle . a new rec@@ t@@ angle can simply pull it by using the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the size , use the button button in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the Save File Save file in the menu to save the newly designed photo .
in fo@@ aming area you can change the size of the rec@@ t@@ angle by shift the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain .
in the tool Fol@@ lowing aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ size width is assigned .
the tool After aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you use cen@@ timet@@ res , In@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically centr@@ ate the selection automatically or vertically .
below for dialogue , you can set the Max . ratio button to access the size possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings on the image @-@ orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are stored as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are stored in the image and not the original image .
the settings of co@@ hes@@ itations allow help to hide your images better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmonious divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility of rec@@ t@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden middle : the golden centre is a division leading to different natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the leaf sheets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we find as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used to construct your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting particle is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden centre . a composition which follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden centre provides fluid relief lines if you compose a picture . these help become listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to the third party , the Golden Spir@@ ale can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
another rule is the right side of the golden spiral , also called the golden right corner . it should be used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be placed into the center of its composition . it can be a line or different objects . this can be simply there without the eye , it will fulfil its task .
the Golden triangles are also guided from the above @-@ mentioned golden spiral . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are no equ@@ il@@ ateral triangles . diagonal to place these lines can place a static object of more dynamic .
when you use golden triangles in order to break your frame , create a effect of a professional photographer dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your photo foc@@ uss@@ ed on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition which you can not reach different .
the options horizontal refle@@ x and vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ iliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of your lines to your current picture .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
if you make a photo , then it is easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ al . you can fix it with the &amp; digi@@ al ; image editing and the tool free rotation . select the transform@@ ers free rotation and adjust the target angle .
turn your picture with the slide angle . the values on this slide are specified in degrees . by default , you can set the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right .
for your help the module provides a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
once you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is the function transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ ther the image a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tiv@@ al transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ comp@@ uted automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels .
new heights : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels .
angle left at the top : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
after adjusting the perspective , the image will be somewhat contaminated . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two custom@@ iz@@ ations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after which you have adapted the perspective , you get unwanted tri@@ angular holes to the corners . one way to ber@@ some it is the picture with transform@@ ers cutting off the image processing .
the calibration tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image will be dist@@ orted . with other words , a rec@@ t@@ angle is transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can run this module over transform@@ ers .
make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press on prefer@@ ences , the angle is reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target range are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
at your help a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image .
after completing the calibration , the image will be a bit wi@@ thered . this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible , but two notes created twice as much devast@@ ation and so you should avoid this .
after shifting , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate these is the picture with transform@@ ers cutting off the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the type as these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ al .
based on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on this site . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF below .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; displays only files in formats that knows . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file extensions &amp; digi@@ p@@ ments . in the configuration configuration you can find more information .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras allow you to select it even the use format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compressor to digital images . this way redundant information is reduced to save the image data in an efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also store los@@ s@@ less if this is indicated in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or T@@ IFF to the Roh@@ ing@@ Converter of &amp; digi@@ al ; you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ ous ; .
&amp; digi@@ ous ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ al ; all support cameras can be seen below the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ ous ; supports :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in the avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . but you don &apos;t have any film editing program and it &apos;s not a film editing program and it &apos;s not available anymore . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for viewing movies use to start playing the program .

if you are doing the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do good if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four Just@@ ings with the module white .
many tools you need for photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ al ; contain their description here .
all image editing tools such as sharp@@ ness , turn@@ out , noise supp@@ ression , refle@@ cting , im@@ sharp@@ ly mas@@ c@@ ate , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture Applic@@ able quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nail . these modes are :
without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the range of the selected model .
horizont@@ ally , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the range below the selected model area .
the left section shows the original and the right to comparison the effects of the filter .
horizontal parts . the upper area shows the original and the lower part of the filter effect .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the used colors can be adjusted in the common settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select preview . you can move this frame with the mouse within the picture and on the part of the picture you want to see the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjustment from the latest use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by yourself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data origin@@ ates from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider represents an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ atures . push C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull out a square . all photos inside this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is of course ahead of your images Ge@@ o data .

the Pal@@ etten files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ all@@ ets or browse the folder to files .
the cur@@ sor is shown as a line in the p@@ allet view . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color to it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box is cur@@ sor under the button color , the color will be inserted into the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode is selected or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode is checked , you can choose to select the check box under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the promotions , cut out and paste .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional colour name , if another color follows in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ o@@ dit ;
the colors in the p@@ allet and the print selection can be drawn with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free to visu@@ alize . the programs which contains &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are based on view of the program author &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; -@@ programs with only few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; project has set itself to the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphics surface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graph@@ s with all the options of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ s re@@ comp@@ uted and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; opening or the graph in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; opening in a &amp; Kate ; component
loading large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and one h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for presentation of the graph . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in its own under@@ window . in this case , the tool bar is empty , as in the lower screen photo . in this case , the tool bar contains just the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last open files . click on the first icon to view the dialog file .
after you have one or more &amp; dot ; files chosen , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the straight in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; loaded file changed from another program , the following window will appear :
you can choose whether the graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can also notice your decision as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up your choice later , you can set up the menu settings .
if you open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; eg . open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; -@@ instance you want to display a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; -@@ instance you want to display the invitation in an under@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change them with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all the graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph will be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose if the parts of the graph will be placed on this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph without head@@ line and with a different font
the site again provides the option to specify behavior if a file is modified on the hard disk , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or program the program every time .
the page open the option to specify the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph , if a graph is open outside of a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( open the graph@@ s in a new window or specify in a sub @-@ window of the already current session ) or determine that every time you are asked .
the seat of seating is the possibility to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph . you can open a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine the files of the last session ( or not ) or determine at any start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further possibilities are opened :
here you can select among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Layout algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; -@@ Algorith@@ m , the standard for directed graph@@ s . he manufactures hier@@ arch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graph@@ s . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to right or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as possible few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ fair graphics . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spring @-@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statist@@ ic multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographic in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system that is used by GPS and Galileo , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and lat@@ itude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in GP@@ X format and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call up the menu . to download a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you have to load a backup file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data that were taken at the same time as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed , which displays the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore needs to be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . put here your camera zone .
the setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation is an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the devi@@ ation below are the data collected . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these boundaries here and then cor@@ relate the button .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog , the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the shown card and set it . if you have reached the relevant area and increase it again , you must always be selected manually . the map can always be changed manually . the card can be changed manually . the card can be changed manually .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.0@@ 1 . you can select the albums available as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be customized to select . the tab is allowed to select all the albums you need to select by HTML . in the area , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ sis and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely in@@ explic@@ able for each image . if you then click on a picture , a new page is displayed in the picture . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed .
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all of your related images . choose a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything that will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . this also affects the file size . all other settings are explained by yourself .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user as far as the action is . press release to break the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically shut . you can therefore read the programming messages in order to display whether error occurred during the production process . the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery . press Close to lock the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and do on them base operations such as speeds , zo@@ oming or shifts . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it was developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown as default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG @-@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is it the file size is increasing since there is no compression of the color form@@ ations . this can be found at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera tool is a tool that allows you to connect your machine with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module editor is currently not documentation . if you wish to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org des K@@ IP@@ I teams .
with the import function of the metadata model , you can copy the image from one image to another . then , select the image file dialog with which you want to copy the image file , so the image to which you want to copy the metadata . copy the data to which you have pressed the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a sach@@ ar .
the MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ asch@@ au .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . in addition , you can create a background color for the slide format . using this module , you can use the formats DVD / X@@ VCD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the tool you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . then you can launch the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected from you are listed below image files in the portfolio . you can also change the image and content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adapt the other settings . if you are planning to select the file from different formats , DVD , X@@ VCD , SV@@ CD and VCD , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NTSC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds . the speed of the image file is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high however very smooth image change .
the background color can be set to be set next . in doubt you should set them black . specify the name and path of the generated file . if you specify the name of the MPEG @-@ output file .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then you can start the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can then go to the production of your computer . depending on the speed of your computer you can then drink a coffee or in all the rest of your computer , if you are back again .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , then you can adapt the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages on the kno@@ b settings .
the printer assist@@ ent allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp . this is , for example , to improve or print with the Gimp module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original condition of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it generates the same results as the software from your comra@@ de . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first , choose the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window appears then in mode for a single image . you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the converter process . the first option decides to adjust the camera values for the white . if the result is not optimal , you can process the picture below .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use counter information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and the file name is equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , T@@ IFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compression .
if you want to process your pictures often or otherwise , you should not select the JPEG format , as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteri@@ or@@ ated . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JPEG as storage format , metadata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF data .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start running button . if you want to break this process again , you can use it .
the stac@@ king mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to automatically over@@ write the file . this is helpful if this is not available in a previous attempt . a preview of progress is not available , but the progress bar is progres@@ sed to how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of any album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and tim@@ est@@ amp of the uses .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . there are four types of image change available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . width or height of the image will be automatically chosen depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt to your image format .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
printing preparation : prepar@@ es the image for the camera pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , edge size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the sending images before . more images can be shown on the list of images to be sent and put there .
after you started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images displayed by you . you can add more images to the right image with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right side .
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the pictures of the images to add .
with the kno@@ b images you will remove the selected images from the list of the images shown .
after you have selected all the images you can open with the button OK the new message window to your e @-@ mail clients . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . you have to add the pictures selected as an app@@ endi@@ x .
do not take care of too many images at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . it might be a good idea to send more e @-@ mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and every time used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments will be added to the images into a text file and added to the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore have P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and files the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to the images displayed .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down when searching for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button closing , you can lie down this window ? en .
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have shown your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the chosen and all pictures of the album here .
the Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation enable very elegant image trans@@ itions with Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graph card because otherwise the slides will be very slow .
the file names indicate that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images in the left lower corner will be displayed during the presentation .
the loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a terminal loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c ; ab@@ ort .
the option will randomly select that the pictures are displayed in a random order . so it will not be used the order of the pictures in the album .
taking a delay between the images can be set at the time interval between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds match 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should be out before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . randomly sel@@ ects a different effect when moving between pictures .
during the Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn off .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au .
at the left , you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , position of current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date adjustment is currently not documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g . attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your KDE operation surface .
once you have signed your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture , are now available in every group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories you have entered as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , watching the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse to the entry , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to some individual pictures .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere .
in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but for each person you can store your own thumb@@ nail , that is , of course , also for places , keywords and other categories that you have defined for yourself . see the picture .
to display images next to the name , select the button that you want to select the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you have no appropriate pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you have to specify which image for each individual person must be displayed . in order to do this , you will have to select the picture @-@ pin window ( as described in the picture ) and select the image below for the appropriate person . in the An@@ sich@@ ts window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image will appear or cut off or cut off .
when you visit the main window in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is similar to the dialog for the feast of the image properties very similar . you can watch this dialog on the picture .
if you enter a string in the field label or description , you may also enter a date and descriptions of the images according to this text , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you may also use a part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options below the bottom part of the window you can browse all the pictures after certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted here .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but prefer to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick access , screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you launch &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry with photo@@ album ; you can then download some sample images and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
the time line can display several different time units . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bars only 10 @-@ minute @-@ sections .
the time line can be used on the following ways : you can change the displayed viewing view from the database ( if you select a date , you will always display the current picture of this date in preview @-@ files ) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images , if you navigate in preview View .
you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the line bar , so the time information is displayed . if you select a range , you will only see pictures of this period . you can break the selection by clicking a bar bar on the bar .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user interface you can create in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; built in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , which you can call on the HTML menu ...
before HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the trans@@ verse and description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the review page . see information about export files you will find in .
lastly , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML page . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed without description . for example , you may not use any pictures of a party . currently , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are unique , which is why not specifically received .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . therefore , those you have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images can download , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so , it can browse your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , place the various folders and the URL to where your website is stored .
best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first you have to select the root folder , in which all your pictures will be saved . this folder will be saved and select for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a KDE supporting protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if these are really visible to the viewer . if you have created for the base folder a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you should set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder , you need to manually copy it manually . so the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final target of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folders in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the just described settings are related to all three to basic folders or URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , its name you can choose in output folder .
if you are looking forward to a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may need to add a HTML page to view images , admission , etc . , then you must enter with &amp; k@@ photo album ; this work is not yet to do .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import another in your database . the images are used with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file , whether the images are stored in the file or if you only have a link to the file , that you can have all the pictures into the file so regardless of the file . the obvious down@@ side is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two times . first , the images that have entered in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file are not found , so the images of the URL you have indicated in creating the HTML files . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML exports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for Export images is described , which you can call on the File Properties menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
to copy the Manu@@ ell option near the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the option Automatic to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is normally not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to comp@@ ress this , simply select the config file .
the last option of this page is limit maximum image size . if you send your friends image , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would not be very large . here you can limit the size by telling example that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the Menu file import ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the Wiz@@ ard to import consists of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that you are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Person@@ nel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; category ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) while this category is called in your database . this is why you should be imported in the third dialog window which should be imported into the file in the third dialog window and which categories will match these in your database . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fourth step you can see the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture .
it must be easy to browse and watch images : if you look at pictures you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will find the different steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information on your pictures , via ( 2 ) to pass through and through ( 3 ) Advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about images , but often it also closes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; saves all of its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can copy on a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want to secure a disk or re@@ visions in CVS .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; re@@ members the folder , in which your pictures are stored and used this at future start . if you want to read another folder with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; using the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
on the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide you will explain the various setup options .
on the left you can see six different icons with which you can visit the viewer &apos;s preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call through a button to the F1 key and click on the option .
it has been described as you can define for every image different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog box options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a center like in expl@@ aining .
in view , you can find the setup options available to you to establish the membership groups . with the above selection list you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , you will find a list of the current category and in the right one list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo album ; share his mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ plug and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plug@@ in interface . see information on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the modules module . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most modules have a help page which you can use about the modules yourself .
since the modules of multiple applications can be used together , it can always test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu . do not say , I would not have warned you !
the applications that are using modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage if you share functions with various applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this sim@@ ulates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which matches the current view , so show all the images that show you the picture preview .
in addition to the current album &amp; k@@ photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here you get &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &apos;s browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have set in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums , for example , if you are using the category individuals , so do &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you have chosen people to view and to share this module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules that modules are to be loaded .
on the picture you can see an example of the start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other KDE application , you can see the window and a tool bar . under the tool@@ bar , you see the window that you have entered your picture database . in this section we will not show more information about your pictures . in the section we will now show you on this window , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture taken with notes , where the picture was taken on . you can set any image on either individually or for a bigger number of images . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is depicted and all pictures were included in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and bro@@ ws@@ ing how you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view lists three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on the shifting of images within the list : if you are depicted for example a family celebration , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people may be depicted , so that the names are moved upwards , the people will find faster and assigned .
if you prefer to see a alpha@@ be@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon to sort by date under the list .
if you have chosen comments for each image individually , you may still edit all selected images and add these images with notes . simply click on the front and back buttons that are below preview of the picture right above .
if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , it may be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles , California , are all available in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as a trans@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or Sub@@ category . in addition , you can also make an entry to a category or to make this entry into a Sub@@ category this entry . attention , this requires you to sort your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically . see also this .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by moving the strip that make the surface of the frame , click and move . you can also make your own window by drag it outside the window .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... which offers you the opportunity to save the current layout and the appearance of the window .
you can also leave a frame completely . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then window a / fade . this can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you can get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not have a filter . for example , you can download the size of the thumb@@ nails , configure by simple after pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you miss a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the image preview . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and delete in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the pictures anywhere , so you can record the pictures anywhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images loaded from the hard disk .
pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is available . however , you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer .
as you see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and to copy them again . if so , you don &apos;t support trouble @-@ to @-@ insert your images , please purchase a bigger hard disk to save all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to keep a little more privacy you want to click on the pictures you want to see for other in@@ accessible and click the menu . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures you want to see your little sister , upcoming and choose the menu .
so , you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of your little sister . if you want to put your laptop now on your little sister , simply select the pictures you want to get hidden . if you would like to show the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in your privacy menu .
please remember that this picture prot@@ ector is by no means very safe . for example , all images on the hard disk and to the other one can easily read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection can only be trusted , those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbi@@ d the view of private images .
the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at some point . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo album ; for a picture _ and video review . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer you can see in . naturally , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ Box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily configure and put it somewhere else . all these options are displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you then click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you chose people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have invited several pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them and back , by using the keys picture high and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as Di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds . how often it can be checked by pressing the Str@@ g button and plus or Min@@ us . then the slides will be stopped and stopped by using the keys C@@ trl ; S .
a very useful ability of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is used to change full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch back to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can click into the picture and zoom out . with the mouse button you can unlock a rec@@ t@@ angle in the middle of the picture . with the Min@@ us button , you can zoom out again in the middle of the picture . it shows how a zoom rec@@ t@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ om@@ t shown . with the mouse button sets the zo@@ oms so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel image of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work on videos that come in and zoom out with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ ust@@ aste .
with the rotating functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you have a look at the image you can find a picture with a person whose name you &apos;ll have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to insert this name . however , you may proceed to mark only the image and look at further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you are looking at one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with traits , while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in which you press the corresponding letter . in view , you see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , you can see in your browser . if you have always selected all the images you want to print , print or whatever you have selected , so you can easily copy all of you to copy the selected images to a CD , or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail view . if you can view categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail , then you can add features to the pictures by simply press the letter for the characteristic after the picture has been selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you will allow you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; paint on the picture .
the painted is not saved with the image , but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your mixture later .
in , you can see a picture on the painted . to turn on the painting from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; click on the image to finish off the context menu . simply click on the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must work the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should absolutely read and understand .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their qualities are displayed in the object properties and displayed the objects in the wire module .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are several positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be inserted , so you can choose the right position :
delete either from the menu bar , or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before .
if you have modified features , click Apply to adopt these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message is corrected using a bug description . then you can click the input errors or dis@@ card the changes with dis@@ rup@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ User Document@@ ation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the unique view .
press on preview in the scene view and a small example of the scene is removed using the chosen texture . if you want to select a texture part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you tick locally .
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can pull this control points with a mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points and it will appear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling the mouse inside the whole window .
each object has a visual model as a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the visibility of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only then if they are selected or their visibility stage smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar chosen by the scene .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as a default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you do not like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it as desired . you can also store several shut@@ ters and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window over or under a present view , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the upper or bottom of a view . a rec@@ t@@ angle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the An@@ f@@ asser to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be ancho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the An@@ f@@ asser in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views through clicking on the card leader above in the views .
the last possible window order are floating views : views that are not ancho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , draw the An@@ f@@ asser on the desktop or click on the small left side above @-@ line arrow in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the An@@ f@@ asser@@ ie . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for any kind of views . new views are suspended , you can anchor them at any point .
you can save the current window view with view window order ... and it will display a dialog in which you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program has to be correctly installed . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ ders icon in the tool bar or select the menu item scene .
a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon of The R@@ ender settings in tool@@ bar or in the View View menu option ... the following dialog will be opened :
each re@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode .
in the map size you can enter the width and height of the higher picture . if you only want to render an image of the picture , select the check box below and enter the image section for ren@@ ders into the input fields .
in combination @-@ field quality , you can select the features that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for rendering . this is done by a very simple color and light model to create a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user guide to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture emerges with only one ray per pixel , different mistakes can occur . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or chair effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of this error . in general , pictures with this feature better look .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates &amp; connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is constantly split and adap@@ tive because the re@@ version depends on the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray reviews a ray of pixels . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified parameters , then both pixels are calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you calculate the depth value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the rec@@ ti@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . when you turn J@@ itter@@ ing , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light @-@ fle@@ x@@ ion . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map card , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent , if their beams have no object .
opens a new window to display the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , not currently supported by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor in order to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ds . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
if you click on the Help @-@ View , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Document@@ ation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example altitude ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ t@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can adjust the object reception of points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the button separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects like the ball , you can set the detailed press for two directions separately .
if you cross high detailed information for advanced projec@@ tions , all the wire model is used , all projec@@ tions with exceptions of perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this feature gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to rendering .
when you show wall displays a wall behind the objects , the wall will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you tick ground , there will be a floor underneath the objects . the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you tick c@@ abling , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for the rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more precise information about the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes .
on this page you can change existing window boards or create new window arrangements . in the section window regulations explain how to create and store windows .
the standard window arrangement : displays all existing window boards . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window order when starting the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the list of new window boards displays all existing window boards . you can create a new arrangement with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views for the chosen window order . new views can be added to the button and delete selected views on the button .
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with tab@@ by card , you receive a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you would like to follow without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should find the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a bul@@ let on one level .
but you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can use as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image .
if you have everything installed faul@@ t@@ less , take the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program .
these menus and symbols are often used frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . in order to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry edit . thus , you have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the contents of the view object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera will find . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera will change in the view control points , with which you can change the camera in view . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the button user or the input button , change the wire model views and the object tree according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . for example , you might insert a qu@@ ader ( insert the body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a reversible method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and press the button user or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view also shows the level , even at the moment just as limited to the plane . when you render the scene , the level extends to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can see the entry for the bottom . in this case , you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you can only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and adjust the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit of different materials at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog in which you can select as the object is to be inserted . please select the object in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now .
of course , the preview of the Pig@@ ments only shows a matt black material , because you need to check the pig@@ ment for the pig@@ ment . please try to check the colors at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way now .
if you don &apos;t see color on qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button button and then call the preview button .
the material for the floor is right now . if you render your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you need to insert two new attributes . then , in the color scheme you need to do two new attributes . then , select this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the property tree , select the colors in any time and change the colors in view of the object properties :
this step you should already be able to execute the basic work of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should already understand the ball . the ball is just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button user ) , so the ball will float above the ground since you have moved the floor to bottom a unit .
of course the rendering now gives a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put a suitable material in the following step .
if you chose the ball , you can now assign a material to you now . as already on the ground , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as colour :
select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , select Settings and select the values as follows :
but you can reach interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on Apply or press the input button .
the Settings brightness effect and reflection results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not at all selected :
you should now have a good impression of what ways you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offering . hopefully you have learned so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
when you play a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ er , the Ren@@ derer hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that explo@@ res scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects will be reflected in the scene and how atmosph@@ eric effects like the m@@ ist . so the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you can also see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously , every scene needs to be re@@ acted , some light sources and at least one camera .
in usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in default file dialog you can select a file that you have done with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and disk space .
imagine the scene in the last stored version . all changes since the last store are rejected .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you haven &apos;t saved any stored changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only select if you have used Edit Back@@ sets .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the key@@ hole and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ list . you can change or add new commands to this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands or add new commands .
opens up a dialog to set up the tool bars . you can add and remove the tool@@ bar option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to apply rough surfaces without any b@@ ump on the surface individually model and without changing the geomet@@ ric shape of the object .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body . these models will then be processed further to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel @-@ base , by applying an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return key .
you can adjust whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . if a password file is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c ; .
in dialogue set up - &amp; ball show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can adjust the work@@ load of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the two other , Short@@ cuts for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the key@@ note for each window .
if this is selected , the images are open in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is enabled , invites &amp; ball show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still select the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; at the end of the last opened folder . the next start &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored beams to select a background color . it is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is also filled with the selected colour .
you can &amp; ball show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program .
this option increases the display window to the full screen . this option is enabled as default .
specify if the slideshow can begin with the first picture in the folder or with the selected image .
the interval between the image change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until they change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the cards Short@@ cuts for the display window and Short@@ cuts for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window .
shows large icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short description .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short description .
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short description .
the picture shr@@ inks by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Ch@@ ick@@ show ; it is also closed if no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is useful only if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on the &amp; digi@@ al ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ al ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and modifications .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user is dependent on it , at least problems and potential improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it easy to report as possible . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains problems or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed and you can simply follow the instructions to return your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you have a more common users of &amp; show@@ photo ; you can then answer any other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; it is the developer mailing list to join . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you much control of his working processes as possible . there are many options that you need to adjust the behavior of &amp; show@@ down . to set up on these settings , you have to change the settings dialog in eight pages . you can change between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left .
in the area of exposure @-@ inde@@ xes , you can select the color that is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ mode should display colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you important information and promotions to the selected images . you can also find this page in the picture . you can click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and scan them .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can also store a dialog for storing or save the images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images from the store .
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ Bu@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be put on the command line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in Terminal , if this scanner can not be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for the selection of the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . wi@@ pe off &amp; sk@@ ate ; finish .
other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
to can@@ on a picture , the user can start a Vor@@ aus@@ aus@@ can and then scan the scan for the final scan . the preview button is launched by the Pre@@ view button .
to select the picture better the user can zoom into the picture and select from the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in so that the full preview fits in the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
when storing a preview in the settings , the image will be shown in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is stored and ch@@ lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you will return to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; through the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialogue is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be chosen before storing a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the style as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; pictures stores it . dialog to store for each image opens the dialog before each scanned picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically needs to store in a previously defined folder , then you must store it without a file name .
this setting defines where the pictures can be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue on saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is furthermore the proposed name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically stored image will be counted when a picture is stored when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality to store . if Cho@@ ose your image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help the KDE help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the KDE over -@@ Dialog box for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings will show the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ ate .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like all other programs short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these pump@@ ing and their function . you can set up a list of this short@@ cut by clicking the right mouse button in the Player window and select a Global button on the Player window , click on the Player window and select Short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may also set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Short@@ cuts are doing your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , playlist , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function pause could be &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de . in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the modules are available and use k@@ dialog for the user to run why a script does not work .
start of &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is RE@@ QU@@ IRE@@ D for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the Fol@@ ders scripts / templates you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . they will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with amar@@ ok and manage Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in every KDE installation .
most scripts therefore allow the exec@@ uting of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is used . this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts will continuously monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data you need to worry each script itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the work@@ folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might be played &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions more information about the new piece ( e.g. the metadata or the track length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integ@@ rating between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ iz@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le , contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified . to remove an entry on your own entry , you can use the d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok is finished , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the Sign@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed using a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which allows users to recognize the archive clearly as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages properly .
the main script must be executable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be executable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
if your script package is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page by &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features , yet surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can easily draw music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus . maybe you can also find a quite certain title out of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you would like to hear ? then , the play@@ lists will always be hard for you . and if your decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . so many different audio systems can be used , so that YOU can listen to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music !
usually you have to enter the following folder of amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok in the base folder :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should not have any trouble when comp@@ iling , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; just like most applications you can activate or disable some of the applications that you can activate or disable the configure point . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activ@@ ating de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can set up without effort using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cards to set up the various features of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
player window displays the player window , in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be displayed .
voting bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option will switch the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
tuning full design : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this is the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
note : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . when this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored on the storage site of the respective music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok . ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser be started by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if a browser is needed .
other bro@@ wsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not included in the list below .
playlist , save the current playlist , automatically saves the playlist by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored .
note that the playlist window will be visible , that the play@@ lists will be switched off / off , in order to always keep the running piece in the visible window .
when changing to the context menu , change the context browser automatically , as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section appearance , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance is custom@@ ised . the section is in three parts sub@@ section .
in the fonts section , you can use the usage of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context Browser . press on Select ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the selection of custom color scheme , you own the qu@@ al of choice and can define a color scheme . use the color selection for front and background colour .
playback at the start caused that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , the playback is automatically continued with the piece , with which it stopped at the last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is displayed , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select the font font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes that the text is shaded by the O@@ SD .
your own colours gives you the opportunity to adapt the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color panel will open the color selection . if suit@@ cases are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de are used ; -@@ colors are used .
the display text displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be customized to your needs . below you will find a list of the available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can define on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment will appear in the O@@ SD screen .
the map audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate more adjustment in this map card .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection with its name , check the check box next to its name . this section also includes check@@ box for setting up as with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder will search for music .
changes to changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . moreover , an incre@@ mental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
play@@ lists : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists added to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ s and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection data is used to select a database for the collection . drop down sel@@ ector driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , further installation in the sub@@ window MySQL is necessary .
the MySQL institution is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : will the calcul@@ ator enter , on which the MySQL database is set , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data you need to connect to the database .
the card pay@@ .@@ f@@ m is directed to last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
sending pieces and so the profile update : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; , the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters recall : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each of the played pieces will be given . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other KDE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so ( including those contained in it , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , such as k@@ deli@@ bs minimal compiled .
some functions like e.g. the O@@ SD is pres@@ umed that your window manager will work the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . we try to assist Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this file to delete the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib when reading the Meta @-@ Infos from this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is something sophisticated .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok used are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if for example &amp; Amar@@ ok , compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , Tag@@ li@@ b is compiled with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then this leads to overthrow the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you use KDE with art@@ s@@ d , then disable autom@@ . turn off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the E @-@ Mail will automatically appear in a crash ) . if it comes to a commonly occurring crash , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error is resolved .
this is because many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but this is not known as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The File $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : Mp@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &apos; Er@@ ror during writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; or $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) is always active in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click the status center under App@@ endi@@ x 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases , you can click on a symbol for up to three times , until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this bug : amar@@ oc@@ app : icon L@@ ook@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which cat@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ zed Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ al finds the right version first .
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems clari@@ fy the easiest by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use the help with other users or for developers . use the Forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Canal # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only if you find something about the correction of an error in amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only an empty playlist . how do musical pieces get there ?
that is simple . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ up window is converted into the statist@@ ic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points will be calculated automatically .
to evaluate each piece , in the playlist , the evaluation column must be displayed . click anywhere in the new application column , to specify the evaluation for a piece . you can also use the Short@@ cuts Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ al is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select Von playlist remove from the folding menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the tool bar of the playlist , directly next to the Add button , the button can store playlist . click on it .
probably you &apos;re missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ dev@@ el and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the Equalizer can be found in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) and you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used by the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question of the media types are supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . g@@ amer can even support lyrics and P@@ NG !
it may be ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which is not provided in default for any MP3 decoder . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , inputs
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the g@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows several applications to use the device at the same time ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software Mixer ) . see also the help mix D@@ mix for AL@@ SA .
the output of this command should help you in finding the problem stationary and a solution . for g@@ amer you may need to specify another string ( e.g. os@@ s@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded . g@@ amer is not easy to listen to AL@@ SA . G@@ stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data . G@@ stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set .
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error message . read the magni@@ fying sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts drivers , but instead of Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE multimedia complete around the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts drivers . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less s@@ lugg@@ ish react . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ asp@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; Amar@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow @-@ register to register all the streaming components .
read the g@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask for IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok earlier ! ) : - Download Sy@@ peg file , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and then run @-@ register again . now run &amp; Amar@@ ok . .
please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes , send them the best to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are spar@@ ked by the gentle sounds of the music that you have stopped before bed .
how to read the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ? current title if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current play : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pl@@ aying
replace IP address with your username and username . this assumes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent , in the size variable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Rights mouse button provides a piece in the queu@@ e in the queu@@ e . by pushing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search returns .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the Control bar ?
with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser should be displayed .
my Personal folder $ HO@@ ME is based on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can not be created and displayed on the console will appear many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok on a local drive , or use amar@@ o@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
put the CD , then click in the menu on Audio CD . it opens a file browser with several folders . to normal read , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . to automatically remove files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List Val@@ ues = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , Per@@ cent F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HERE ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escape string ) ) ;
basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has a total score .
you can add the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking on a column he@@ address in the playlist window . then you can click on a column in the playlist , just like any other attributes , click on the piece and edit : select your rating or modify F2 . you can also edit the review in the dialog metadata .
the developers do not want to present you when you want to publish a stable version of amar@@ ok . this means : KDE packages have a fixed publication plan that doesn &apos;t plan to bring together with the short term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , but some users can also find a bit annoying . disable the option icon in general settings in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click to install new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ quest@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
in the navigation area , the monitoring and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok then allows you to browse through Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 in order to display the navigation area . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select Amar@@ ok in the folding menu .
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you require only a free user name and a password . Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you wish to use AL@@ SA , please make the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of stor@@ ages and thus also caused a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not comp@@ ile this output module . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still doesn &apos;t appear . and now ?
probably use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you need to install x@@ ine @-@ dev@@ el . after that you need to re@@ comp@@ ile and install x@@ ine .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. how can I fix it ?
her version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with pre@@ stige , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to comp@@ ile g@@ amer without pre@@ sides . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : Ver@@ wen@@ d@@ ne does not comp@@ ile L@@ D@@ FLA@@ GS if you are comp@@ iling Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 although the module g@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with g@@ amer , the g@@ amer quick@@ time module has to be installed besides g@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator register . then you restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can we use Amar@@ ok the second sound card ?
set up under Settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output you specify the device . typically , for example HW : 0 for the standard sound card and HW : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a onboard AC@@ 97 @-@ co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intellectual 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 0 &quot; type HW card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; HW : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type HW card 1 }
enter the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is based on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check box at Sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you must@@ n &apos;t hesitate to take this problem yourself into your hands ! if you like , you can get the new so urgently needed advisor for Arts : )

&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the sub@@ window is starting off . the information provided here are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information in the statistical window can be collected ( ex@@ tras statistics ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sub@@ window music shows information about the just running piece , as well as the perform@@ ers and the album .

the button Edit allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database is stored . this is no running text script required .
the button searches goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .

if you enter between the search terms OR enter , according to entries , which contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three included ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , then include the search term with go@@ ose po@@ ets : Mike Old@@ field . thus , you are looking for entries to contain Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or less . for example : rating : &gt; 50th This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not include a certain search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ Some@@ thing search for pieces that are not included .
you can combine these synchron@@ ized options according to each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and not included the comment .

after you &apos;ve done all &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; please press the button Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like as it looks like :
in this dialog window , you can follow the progress of the head process . once the reading of the original is complete in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium , to which the data should be burned .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; burns the image file . you must now wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the QT designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Widget modules can not be found . to fix this problem , you can add q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS / lib / k@@ de@@ 3 / plug@@ ins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IRS by your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
the website of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b@@ .org . here you will receive the latest version of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and you can get feedback on community assistance from the forums and learn news .
if you want to use &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tured description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; cd@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; cd@@ record ; has all functions that also contain &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; it is usually automatic &amp; cd@@ record ; for burning CDs it is reached &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality with burnt audio CDs .
cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read out digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are generally referred to as Ri@@ pper .
OGG Vor@@ bis Library : OGG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , pat@@ ent@@ less and professional technology for audio co@@ dation , and for handling audio data streams . OGG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competitors to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Lay@@ ers II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a well developed MP3 Decoder can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so that you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Lib@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ x : a program that can convert between different audio formats and convert . SO@@ x is used by the SO@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Imag@@ er : a fully @-@ featured car system for editing , dis@@ assem@@ bling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool will be used for adjusting the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and Mp3 @-@ collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different capture of the different albums can lead to the un@@ fair effect , which can be played differently according to music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and play all videos on the CD &apos;s base folder .
this is a convenient method to load recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . KDE &apos;s dialog box is displayed , with which you can select Fol@@ der and File Name for the project file .
stores all open projects . this is the same as if you would call for every single project file .
includes the current project . if a project changes and not saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you can then select between Save and Chang@@ es . you can then also stop the closing and keep the project so open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any stored project what should happen , just as if you had called for each project file .
includes all open projects and ex@@ its &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any stored project , what should be done so as if you would have called a file .
if you visit this entry , you can choose from the release dialog files to add to the project . if you have the same effect as you get the files directly from the top view into the Project View . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Burn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only open if the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many projects related settings . every project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is that ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes me to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you use files for a multi @-@ session CD , even if this function is not used for you , so that you can see the files already existing files and folders .
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature promp@@ ts &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the medium , it displays only the previously imported files back .
opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows you to copy the copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD , which you may then later burn , if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD Copy dialog . this also allows you to copy the copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use the possibility to burn a DVD with the help of the copy dialog , so the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW disk .
open the dialog to the form@@ atting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which will be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write @-@ writing and incre@@ ment@@ ell .
burn a previously installed CD image . the dialog asks you to burn after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you must use other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously introduced DVD image . the dialog asks you according to a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously joint DVD @-@ video can be converted . this dialog box appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as well . it contains information about the read @-@ out video , coding settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the media , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small strip at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
if the folder view goes on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is activated , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions like media info , locks and unlock the drive or dis@@ card the media .
if the content view goes on or off . the content view provides the elect and drag of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
sh@@ uts down the head of the project in the project view or off . the head bar is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the project view has no real function , it looks pretty beautiful and separates the view view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens up a dialog window to change key assign@@ ments for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after you select one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key order below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , you need to setup correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileges are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings will be carried out . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should be able to work correctly . this dialog is intended for person@@ alize and adjustment of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can use either the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or that is identical to the program code K@@ d@@ co@@ p . therefore , both programs are identical in the functional scope , so that the type of your task is crucial , which the accompanying programs you give .
in this chapter , we assume you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program are in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mostly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and further functions for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ c CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ .com ( ) void copy@@ d@@ vd ( ) void copy@@ d@@ vd ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a project via the command line : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ jec@@ t@@ Interface , which is only applicable on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ l ( K@@ URL ) void re@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ ame@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Me@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ unded ; is an audio CD ; it is an audio CD ; it &apos;s easy to read audio CD ; it can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ists ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; files in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers to code this WAV files ( comp@@ ile free compression ) . other enco@@ ders can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD are read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , read out the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ des ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ pre@@ bis ( for MP3 ) , og@@ ged ( for OGG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are already available , it &apos;s not necessary to comp@@ ile a bit yourself . but if for example , FLA@@ C does not need to be used , the installation is also not necessary .
which coding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction of Ko@@ di@@ erer , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ia ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection . if not , it is possible to b@@ ypass the mechanisms of cop@@ ing protection . simply avoid buying the Cop@@ ier audio CD ; s !
while the set @-@ up only needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , after the daily use of a &amp; CD . this leads ( hopefully ) to comprehen@@ sion for the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD : get information from the free@@ DB from the Internet or can completely work without a network , where everything is covered manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is only a brief list of the main window commands . on the page step for example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the Register for the program .
the CD@@ DB will start the CD@@ DB request according to the device from request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection must first be made to the Internet . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the tab card tab in the setup d@@ al@@ ogue - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ coder so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the standard . it &apos;s too aware that before the en@@ coder is configured in the tab card tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ er@@ ts ( such as protocols , pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programs ( as read out the &amp; CD ; ) to configure .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cks ; with various cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) , you must go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes audio quality , coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er .
if no audio information is lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
today , MP3 and OGG files are the most common among the audio formats , such as MP3 and OGG files are the most common . OGG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences become less important , since both Ko@@ di@@ erer will produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high up to very high sound quality ( high bit rate ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bit@@ rates .
OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special Auto stereo equipment . today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common Stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good gen@@ ug for music by yo@@ ungst@@ ers , portable devices and auto@@ stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information , typ@@ ed manually or by the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be delivered / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ des ; and the code name to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters . the manual or help to the code readers explain the switch for these programs .
for example , to add the &amp; CD ; titles to the keyword ( English : day ) when MP3@@ s with l@@ ame are encoded , the switch must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cks ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ds ; parameters used to be needed ( = button number in assist@@ ants ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which the information can download / enter the information instead of yourself in the machine . it &apos;s too aware that all other information is spoken instead of the computer : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. of the U@@ e@@ ber@@ aster ) is not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD . and besides , the information is not yet to be added to the music business . all the information can be added to the music by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ unded ; it is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counter@@ feit ) address that is not used in the system . in this type of configuration , it does not seem to know the e @-@ mail address for retri@@ eving data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer that has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ unded ; for use of free@@ DB , the geographical position is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of mirrors for the online cancellation of &amp; CD ; information during the read of a &amp; CD . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates on the database .
what is the reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in WAV files on my computer ?
there is rum@@ ours that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know it , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD . it &apos;s always the best choice to be installed from the right distribution at first , if this has not happened yet .
for saving the released WAV files , the code can be chosen and used to select the desired file format . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers tab . other code can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined code . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in Chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after the installation of a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers you can get more information about its switch through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ; sole ) must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
this may have many causes . check the device number of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to put both programs with a command line in a terminal . that might be a reference to what is wrong .
check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with one step for example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips how to proceed .
have you read the entire manual , everything understood , but are somehow still uns@@ afe to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to create MP3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 j@@ ig@@ s ( tags ) .
there must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre@@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it can be found as a non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the / us@@ r / share / cd directory contains and that you have write permission ( eg ; by copying them with the quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ unded ; , something that is probably done only once , and
the second section describes the procedure to read out a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each pending &amp; CD .
here we determine the used co@@ effici@@ ant for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program using to use the free@@ DB file to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it with any read of a &amp; CD . if once the matching settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the device number is handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
/ dev / c@@ drom can be specified a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD / DVD drive is available , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stick and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the map General Settings . there &apos;s no much to do here . here you can define an additional conversion . in our example everything will be so bel@@ low / input as shown in screen photo .
only In case of incomplete information , select so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data will automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB calcul@@ ator .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet to access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can easily be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; um@@ ame and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , if you want to manually enter the selection box and free@@ DB mode , if you can use the database before you can use it twice as well . however , you can choose to use free@@ DB in Off@@ line mode , at least the two sel@@ fs must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map .
CD@@ DB is free@@ DB for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from free@@ DB server over the Internet . how do the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as shown in screen photo .
mode : we don &apos;t have downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look at them following a mirror server in your vicinity . on this path , the load is distributed between the computers . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , since however , many fire@@ walls can bo@@ ck the protocol 88@@ 80 as standard , there may be more fortunate with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit &amp; CD data to the free@@ DB server . you should disable the first check box .
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously exclusive pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time when only an existing drive ? a parallel read and code ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try yourself .
CD : dis@@ card out of the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; dis@@ card the end of the process .
user defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this link , the path / folders can be specified , in which the WAV files can be saved . if only space is available on another drive , the files will not be created in the private folder , if you don &apos;t want to do anything with the WAV files .
everything you type as it is on screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something to be blind@@ ed to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP3@@ s . as previously mentioned , the resulting bit@@ rate is sufficient for very good quality stereo quality , even for very good HiFi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restriction of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of later change of the tags file . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously encoded WAV files : when a Du@@ al@@ Core or Quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time .
this is what we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ cks ; this configuration is used as default for any excer@@ pts of a &amp; CD . if you have chosen the organiz@@ ational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD . we will create MP3 files in the previous section , as we are convenient to pick up the music on the hard disk , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB is used . the process of this section is described in this section , must be repeated for any read &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD which is still not included in free@@ DB , screen shots are a bit different from the data for a &amp; CD . therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of pick them out from the Internet . comments are applied to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of this manual .
if this is not done yet , then the &amp; CD has to be set up in the drive that was defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD can be identified as audio CD ; it could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then search in the section questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully collected from the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and in addition , the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key to your &amp; CD ; there will be a window embedded , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) you can also manually trigger the selection of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current title &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the rest of the data in the input field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Album &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artist must not be entered in the input field &apos; actu@@ ator &apos; unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments by ini@@ di@@ v@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB file is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album names ( e.g. if all words start with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to see if there are any unwanted remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on the tab card settings ; take a look at the tab card settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with whom you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see in the aid to the Ko@@ di@@ erer to obtain more information .
simply select an entry , obviously with the style of the read @-@ out CD ; this example is not important since we do not transfer the &amp; CD . for more information please go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are available under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD @-@ editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have already recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way you have entered all titles of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window doesn &apos;t appear when you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB file . it is already sorted into one of these categories of database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the third kno@@ b of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the track list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected can be read or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has been started by clicking on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button , this window appears to confirm . OK , then click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and trace something out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
click on the tab to turn on the folder window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer , which you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have a write access to the file for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3 . thus reading out and coding in parallel . please note the status of status in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able is the result of parallel processes to read and coding . the machine used with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous spin and code ( of course two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e &apos;s queu@@ e . after the last piece is encoded , a small window will appear in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ists ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . / 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ists ; today &apos;s within the &amp; k@@ de ; you can download it as part of the cat@@ ap@@ ults package . most distri@@ butions , however , contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ lies ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you probably already have done it ...
this section is directed to persons , comp@@ iling from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be customized to your needs if it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . at the best , read the step for example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screens of different maps of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , always read on ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first time start of the program , without any clu@@ ding point as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what about it ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author may not maintain this manual . it &apos;s the first version for a hand@@ book to add or change it . at least after the contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agre@@ es with this suggestion .
strange if you succeeded in taking the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others he has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ digital display of texts , also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical display of each MIDI channel by lifting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can go in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from one &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to drag .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the process used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the menu file . the usual file dialog appears where you can select the desired song .
you can also create a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; this will also work with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the tool bar , select the entry sample from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the kno@@ b and drive .
if you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to change left and right of temp@@ o . to get back the original speed , double click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu , thus breaks the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics ex@@ propri@@ ation and again others both . some pieces don &apos;t have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you need to manually set the Karaoke text , so you will have the ability to change this if you want to see the other way in the Settings menu .
if you want to set an event type in case you choose from the menu Settings menu items or song events . the same function also have the 1 and 2 buttons .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these are the series after being played in . in this section , you can use the collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open first the collection manager . in this menu you will find the collection under the point organizing ... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will include the same songs as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the collection manager each time .
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the button . it appears in the file dialog , which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting of automation to the collection .
if automation add to the collection , a piece is automatically added to the active collection ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if Autom@@ atically add to the collection , it will be activated and emp@@ tied the temporary collection when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select a row after the menu , select the songs in the sequence , the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection .
if you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list above the Karaoke text .
to jump on a song , select the button next song , next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right .
to skip a song back , select the button previous piece , the previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the delete collection and click on the button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it does not matter as they are not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI map General @-@ MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that understand the syn@@ thesizer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , which converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et when it is always a trumpet to play a piano .
if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( including AW@@ E - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there is no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the requirements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section that may appear as often as desired . requires that every occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MAP &quot; Another Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible .
in this section , as the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general use will look as follows :
please note that the left side of the equation is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all notes that this instrument will need to take on the sound with the number M ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds like a gun shot . to do this , you can wear the following in the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( ri@@ fl@@ ation ) , patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is located in the MIDI file .
please note that here , with the concept drum @-@ patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the tone is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some keyboards do it ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MAP section is needed to specify how notes are depicted on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
like the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as its presence . thus , you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ note maps are mainly used to form tones at the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel . check out as an example of the supplied ke@@ x@@ maps .
this section can be used to convert some channels to others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the corresponding Key@@ map must be defined on the front in the file ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ kus@@ sions patch on the Per@@ kus@@ sions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if so , an MIDI file will be converted with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then for@@ warded it only . the value of 40@@ 96 will be used in the map file no dec@@ imal .
this setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard , which is to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some keyboards up to an oct@@ ave up to an oct@@ ave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu in Settings , Point MIDI settings
the Can@@ al@@ View is a window with a whole row of Kla@@ vi@@ aturen ( one for every MIDI channel ) . on this occasion , see which sounds are being played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t change green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to view the played sounds . view the View in the Settings menu : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the speed of a song . if so , for example , find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a music piece . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can result in the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file is needed about 50 KB , while an mp3 file you need a similar sound quality . in addition , you can also change the single instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
agreed , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
check the collection of automation to the collection previously . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow keys on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o , click on the LCD panel .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or I would like to play a file only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and the desired file in the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them directly to a collection , switch to the collection of automation to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you want to play the first file . so , set up the setup of automation to collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then do you decide to track also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do it ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , animated me to program further on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Anton@@ i@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; in the third year , I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment , I &apos;m not much spare time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to record MIDI files , music make and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write to me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really do a huge delight when you send me a postcard from your home or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or MIDI file , please contact me . before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me , since I might have the file already .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to make money for this money . I would like to emphas@@ ize it because I only get feedback , because if I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - Beh@@ ind the bug that the pitch was too high in AW@@ E charts .
my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Magnus Die@@ f@@ enb@@ elt , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Peter G@@ rit@@ sch , Johannes Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or just a supp@@ or@@ tive email .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on its homepage , which can also be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also find information on pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends considerably from your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL , it runs as if you could have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD , VCD or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The KDE website on new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Mail@@ ing list .
the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always a window with the central view . and lastly , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is re @-@ released .
it is possible to track the preferred links under the menu bookmark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ archy . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached record .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; not running through the application itself . simply click on a name in the directory , and as next editing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after modi@@ fying XML files , you must be selected from the menu with the playlist and select either the processing mode , or select a different category .
all changes are lost when the processing mode leave or select a different group without using the playlist .
due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some functions can only be switched on by modi@@ fying the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change of &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 if the option is not available , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will consider the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / cd / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at startup does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ate by opening another source . this would end at the end @-@ animation however distur@@ bing , the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; / lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; are supported in the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size can be adjusted from the network and other things .
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config / config / config / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; using the sw@@ f@@ dec mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field of Emb@@ ed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can be restored , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player has to specify the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime Type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library . if no errors occur , the back@@ end output is within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
therefore , a given back@@ end for a certain M@@ ime Type is taken ( of course only if this was determined also ) , this must be done through manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / config / config / config / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . for example , phon@@ on will restore all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using the M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be checked , the scanner can be configured using the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player settings dialog under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there you should be detected , from which one is selected ( e.g. , it &apos;s PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB inside .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one ) . this is why the video for@@ lin@@ ux expansion must be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , this must be included in the following configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of emergence of this documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ ais@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , t@@ v@@ source , source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin playing the playlist .
is there any indications as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from him ( not by the VCD file : / / ) ?

QT ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; k@@ ile .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . among Unix @-@ like systems will probably be back on the package &amp; tex@@ ex ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be used in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . they permit a simple installation without any further comp@@ iling and are on the k@@ ile ; web page included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . if you want to support this project or documentation , contact via the k@@ ile ; web page should be made .
any questions about or when comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ; it is desired to be addressed to or become expan@@ sions , this should be addressed at the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ dev@@ el @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ desktop . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , direct and custom @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions . finally , the easy to use and comp@@ ile tools for this . finally , the easy to use wiz@@ ard , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his ways to learn the manual will be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start working with the editor by &amp; Kate .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right selection : L@@ ay @-@ T@@ ECH ; it is difficult to use , also a loader ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also use it . a less demanding but realistic gro@@ unding is that it desc@@ ends from Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort .
in case there is only a good view to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do . B. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r .
as well as other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , with which the gener@@ alized features such as paper format , side@@ ways and text cre@@ eping with text . the introduction has to be closed with the command \ \ Document { document } and must be closed with the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; command .
the quick @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a useful function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . the selection of the wiz@@ ard ( menu ) offers some opportunities for the creation of the document . they can also be made some of the settings related to the document .
document classes : her@@ eby the type of the document will be presented : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , letter &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; text &#93; &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Prosp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
coding : with this the character encoding of the system will be used . modern systems increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . best systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; . for binding them , they can only be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Document classes of Kom@@ a Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in creating German texts .
new users can &apos;t worry about . there is only a brief description of the functions and further information on these are given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the emphasis added to the screen , settings and elements ( as well as the appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , it is possible to detect some mathematical area . however , it is possible by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless . however , it will saves you through the modest appearance of the output file .
by applying a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) from &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the default line to close the command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) . this function can be used in menu settings ; it can set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encouraged the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ trac@@ ting element ) :
in the view of the document in the structural view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; translated file &#93; &#93; has been created , jump &amp; k@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer on the appropriate line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as font type &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for view , converting and to print DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and spaces .
when using the rings , the elements of DVI ; file with the editor is broken down and once you clicked on a element in DVI ; -@@ source code is the exact opposite of it . as soon as it was clicked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is clicked on the relevant passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer .
Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a Master document the work is simplified using other .@@ tex files . when using a project a project can be set to project project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is seen at the bottom of the game , and it is not a call for &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after quick installation .
when considering the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large selection box should be followed for the rapid structure of the document into the document . the first selection field is for fast structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... the ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; instructions for the division are :
the selection box further is available for example articles such as tags , fox , or references . available conditions are :
designation : with this command , a label is created for a section , a picture or different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified name ( selection over a selection box ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are relevant editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; written by hand .
the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã © is used for the defin@@ ing of the font . it can be specified as the main text for the main text , the fox , etc . , there are the following font examples :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two selection criteria are available for the preparation of a new document by selecting the document &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; 2 . the document can be written down with the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brackets for the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the font color is not set at the beginning . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be pointed out in the text .
as soon as the above source code has been entered the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of the menu building or the button closure .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
depending on the faul@@ ts , the comp@@ iling of the document should be searched for errors . when using quick shell &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
environment ( English environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the remaining document . for example , a report with the font , \ \ , { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } is possible to reduce the formation of the font in the surroundings .
the changes are only over@@ seen within the environment ( specified by the \ \ &#93; { environment } until \ \ , { environment } ) . there are no liability ( number ) for the ages within a environment .
there are many possibilities to answer the read@@ ability and user friendliness of the document . it can be used for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , ital@@ ic pressure , sub @-@ stretching , etc . these commands end either using the \ \ or the end of the environment .
\ \ App@@ ear@@ h } : this command is for the cure pressure and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed using \ \ emp@@ h { word } ital@@ ic .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : creates a quote from the document . the quot@@ ation begins with \ \ of the { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language is shown , a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; .
once in the wiz@@ ard a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . this should be mind@@ . a quote , a few spots in the fat and cure pressure and a poem to apply to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , can be turned back to the editor by editor @-@ View or C@@ trl with an external viewer . in an external viewer its windows must be closed .
once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and fun .
DVI ; is a number of file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ bsp ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers from the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output like printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ transform@@ ers or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed ( in the viewer right ) .
the tool bar cap@@ tures the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , the conversion can begin to open other formats by Kn@@ Ã ¶ P@@ FE in tool@@ bar .
the fore@@ front search encourages the direct jump from the editor to add @-@ in positions inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ der files . only Modern under Settings K@@ ile must set up ... tools for building .
to get out the fore@@ front search , the mouse cur@@ sor must be positioned in a line of the source tex@@ tures and close to preliminary search . the jump to the relevant passage in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then so@@ unding .
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; open and related to the appropriate line . it must be set &amp; k@@ ile ; in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; set up as a text editor ( Settings Ok@@ ie@@ ce ... Editor )
if using quick construction of &amp; DVI , the viewer cannot be able to provide an error . if a mistake should be found , it will appear in the log file or in the news window .
the logging of the log file is the source code in the source code . in the editor you can see the log @-@ in La@@ Te@@ X error . the log file appears in the error , must be clicked on the error in log @-@ up and &amp; k@@ ile ; jumps to the error in the error .
once the button is clicked on the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be written either due to a new document or the wiz@@ ard for quick creation of a new document . more information can be found in the section .
frequent user of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file created or created a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template by writing an existing document and selecting from file template ... Create .
when creating a new document , a template by file New will replace some strings by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings K@@ ile ... settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ O@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the documentation class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ O@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the assist@@ ants and the related commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps were completed :
when creating a new document , you can choose the template &apos;s own template instead of the standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created will be created a simple way to create a template , should be searched for an internet and the steps described below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the ability of reading and sharing of many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you &amp; Kate ; can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunities to learn the manual should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; enjoy working with the editor of &amp; Kate ; begin with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command pre@@ ference which can be called for the help of La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may find a suitable description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use can be used as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with a narrow str@@ g button to train the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , by clicking on the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; \ \ &apos; .
when pulling the text using the left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied into the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with penet@@ rated switch @-@ key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse and emphas@@ ize the different types of source tex@@ tures . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another colour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many assist@@ ants may include an own kind of book@@ marks within the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu items are highlighted in the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this jump brand is highlighted , so it will be automatically highlighted in the first input of a sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent conditions for writing , &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included in the text @-@ selection :
for example , a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing on both sides is a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not meant to be a text , lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source tex@@ as . the only bent thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; this is the fact that the crash@@ es are separated by two empty lines .
unit the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection has also an extended meaning , since this command also has &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a button g@@ utter ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to listen to a part of the document can be removed first of this first , and can be removed by wires of the button . &amp; Kate ; offers the keys to the key . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to include a faster result . under editing , the following commands are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing the cooling unit .
it has already been clear that environments plays a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ ile ; for more commands under the Edit environment for a m@@ illed simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to be used .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close in the area .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ of the { environment } , jump into the vicinity of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) .
in the typ@@ ing of many mer@@ ging environment commands , the most recent environment can be lost quickly . this order is the most recently settled environment , so that the sh@@ red@@ ded environment structure is not broken .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group there are a few important commands that match the editing environment .
this command is inj@@ ected at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the welded clasp .
this command is inj@@ ected at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amps of a &amp; tex ; group # is , will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the typ@@ ing of many w@@ aved groups @-@ brackets can quickly go the view over . this command is the most recently concluded group so that the sh@@ ak@@ tel@@ te structure of &amp; tex ; groups do not be broken .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple inc@@ iner@@ ators are used as a choice for use . for the purpose of the purpose the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign is used for two simple instructions for use . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and take two close suits for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic setting of double occupancy can be set up under Settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and turn out .
there are also large settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting Shift ; Regist@@ ered &amp; k@@ ile ; a intelligent line breaks . if the current position is located within a list of lists ( e. g. rot@@ ates or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is available &amp; k@@ ile ; not only a line breaks but at the same time command \ \ item .
in a tables environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to under@@ line pre@@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . they can be added under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users were able to arrange columns in tables and all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) and all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) tries to encourage them . even though this tab is not the default , for &amp; k@@ ile ; some inter@@ section for the columns of the current tab@@ ulator will be added .
although &amp; Kate ; already offering a good source code reference , it has been expanded in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) there are three different modes . these modes have to set up for the automatic compensation . all these modes have to set up for different ways under att@@ itudes K@@ ile ... .
in the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ of { environment } is &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically added to the command \ \ \ { environment } on an empty line ( for the text ) .
when the R@@ Ã ¼ Store button is removed , the last letter of the input will be removed and allows for the complete listing of the list . on the other hand the list can also be smaller by entering a further letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , you can get a jump from &amp; k@@ ile . alternatively , you can be able to jump to these positions by editing the bran@@ ded jumps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; Con@@ fir@@ ing settings to these lists are made . there can be many different doors for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as doors of the general language used .
the command mode is not possible for the compensation of environments with a few letters to be entered and the call of a complete list is to result in a large list with environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for compensation of environments is used .
when calling the Edit Mode menu , the menu option is automatic or the button of the environment will automatically be folded down and it appears \ \ &quot; s . afterwards , the environment will be carried out in a sim@@ pl@@ est way and can be finished by controlling the input key .
after this is done , the environment will be closed automatically once &amp; k@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a list of lists which is even a first \ \ item command .
under settings k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; default settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the lock list of default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ scores user @-@ defined lists of de@@ preci@@ ation , which are immediately replaced by sub@@ stit@@ uted strings . as an example of a shut@@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word processor mode is inserted in the case of the menu , or by using the CTR@@ L + Alt space bar , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
gro@@ oved doors are not helpful for automatic compensation . however , it has been noted that many W@@ ants are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the compensation for all written entries are already written .
this mode can set up in the menu Settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile Ver@@ sat@@ ile accounts . here , the swelling can be specified for the display of understanding .
the compatibility files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / folders / complete / mode / of the Persian Home folder . mode is available for formation ( off ) , Dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog appears to be arranged by graphics as simple as possible . for the view of the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS -@@ files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an outstanding basis for the manual and new regulations of pages . if the PDF output is available , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf will be converted into a PDF file .
to view the result of the work , you have to be compiled to the source code . all power tools are group@@ ed in the menu creation comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source tex@@ as for the viewer like &amp; Ok@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 by pressing Alt ; 4 by pressing Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file is being viewed .
when using the instruction Quick@@ bau is usually inv@@ oked a viewer after comp@@ iling . if no integrated viewer is used , each window will be able to open a new window .
a new project will be asked for the project new project .... This is what the following information is required for the project :
when used the file name , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r file .
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows to use EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be managed according to scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet final and can be found in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile .
first of all , the use of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile are said to have a system@@ ic object ( = k@@ ile ) with the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system , in which the basic functions are extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different help to sub@@ strate the user .
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this included a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
a complete Re@@ fern@@ z for &amp; tex ; and his former Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â . this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a particular form@@ atting . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ as ; delivered is the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all too &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and contained in a graphic area .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for par@@ cel name or impact w@@ ager . of &amp; k@@ ile ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with mouse , or the space of space bar open the viewer for the document .

the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ain@@ ees ; la@@ f , have to do with &amp; quantum . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more information can be found below .
to install a plug @-@ in or part part , let &apos;s start with the Edit plug @-@ in menu . the following dialog will be opened :
this dialog allows all plug@@ ins to manage and add new plug @-@ ins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage place &amp; qu@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ ins .
many people often work in one kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; supports giving team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickel name is the nickname of user and serves for unique identi@@ fying .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team@@ leader as well as Sub@@ project Manager .
the user can choose from the list of Team Members who he is . this happens by pressing the team member from the list and press the button S@@ etz@@ e as press . the currently selected member ( its identification ) is bold as follows : text .
nickname and the attitude of your own identity are important for news and remarks . see for further information on comments .
in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage by recording members of the team : it can be created an event for inform@@ ing the team manager if something specific happens . see in for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . an example would be able to record the opening of the opening and closing of the project if a file is secured when a file is secured when it is added to the CVS , once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
events created , edited and deleted at the event &apos;s event configuration ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see list of selected address data . the mailing list may be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i will be able to set up such ladder .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
notes must be specified . it may be selected either the note entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
comments can be sent to a determination member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nickname of the entered nickname of the team member , should be given the corresponding domain or sub@@ project name , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small @-@ text , but spaces around the cl@@ amps and the : do the note invalid .
&amp; quantum lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages that supports DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; quantum lus ; -@@ specific settings can be found , a short description for the other can be found .
the settings can be set up by settings Quantum a ... This dialogue extends over a few pages that are dealt with each other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ill ; concerning tags , including car complet@@ eness can be changed . the entries are :
large / small description of tags : large / sm@@ elling of automatically added tags . normal wholesale / sm@@ elling means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / sm@@ elling of attributes : large / sm@@ elling of automatically added attributes . normal wholesale / sm@@ elling means that attributes will be inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; added .
not optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and closing day automatically update : if enabled , the closing day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters in the corresponding encoding during ti@@ pping .
M@@ IME type : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the button standard , the default points can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of new created or in other ways than with file opened open files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) , but this attitude is being loaded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . this setting here will be downloaded from the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ill ; created regularly backup copies , so that the document can be recovered during a black@@ out or crash when saving the file . this is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents , a backup is regularly generated according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor or in an own view ( or documentation in a flash@@ y ) what makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings on the standard at the next start is useful when the user interface came through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it matches the --@@ res@@ et@@ rack command line parameter .
the warning message range serves to tax the possibility to display warning from warning by no more .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can also be specified using symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code @-@ view in shared mode .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser @-@ node in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse button .
in the structural tree settings the visibility of knots in the tree , which is to be set automatically in the editing and how deep when changing the structure tree is to be set automatically . empty spaces are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such an element in which the current document has not been found .
the area to lay short@@ cuts ( a kind of templates ) that can be un@@ folded at the editing . cancellations are valid in groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means that it can be a valid group for PHP , in which the if@@ or abbrevi@@ ation is something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug@@ ins can be managed here . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ uses of third parties , which can be re@@ used by every node @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to plug@@ in if it does not lie on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information will be delivered to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the related folder ( path of current file ) or the project folders .
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using the shop . only @-@ reading @-@ parts usually refuse the shop if this option is not chosen .
check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ill ; if the desired information is correct . select if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; quantum lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting has been completely newly developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been implemented , as well as the support for d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of this , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only a plug@@ in available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; added .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the Options on the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger project is enabled , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all re@@ taining points , with numbers of numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the issue is shown ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . appears normally in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the Debug@@ ger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this promotion , the link to de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , produced , or divi@@ des the plug @-@ in with to listen to debit claims when a project is opened by default , so that a de@@ bu@@ gger must not be considered .
the counter to de@@ bug@@ ging session wins the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or end the leaves according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to enter a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the de@@ bug@@ ging output .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line will continue . if this happens when the script is started , the script will start before a debit requirement starts , the script starts with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens when a script has been given , the execution begins , as soon as a debit requirement is completed , the execution begins as soon as a request is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger brings the next statement in the script without going into the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger brings the next statement in the script , when it is possible in functions and includes .
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one , than would it not be the current ones .
opens a dialog , where a variable or an expression can be entered which is to be monitored . the super@@ a@@ woke value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

documentation type E@@ diti@@ er@@ pak@@ ete ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ es . they permit &amp; qu@@ ill ; abilities as car complete and flexibility are made of &amp; quantitative . their simplicity and flexibility are made of &amp; qu@@ ill ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the market languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic columns of image buttons ( above the editing window ) to insert the text and instructions in a document faster than a user ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , download or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of converting .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are available , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags , as well as the layout and the content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es , which shows &amp; the contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dial@@ og@@ es ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self @-@ tool bars offer a quick paste of tags into a document without any risk of writing .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files carry the name of the read @-@ in language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.0@@ 1 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declar@@ es if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . all about the possibilities and borders will be explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain any type of tags , nothing else .
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; one argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class type class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the Type Method . is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute and attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally it contains the name and type of attributes . additionally it contains more tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element element element .
specifies the source codes for the attributes in tag editor and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ill ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; qu@@ ill . is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a method@@ ology name . the arguments given to the method can be empty or % for the last name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container day that is group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text within a dialog box . this tag can occur only once in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
there is the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the defined tags . this element is an only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces don &apos;t affect &amp; lt ; sign up &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; can be replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialog above is in &amp; qu@@ ill ; -@@ window to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A window . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently , the verification takes place when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ain@@ lus .
in the following example , an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP file will be described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day &gt; &amp; lt ; day name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; string &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; string _ name = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D . this can be edited di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be prepared for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it should be used to create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ill ; version &amp; lt ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( - / / W@@ 3C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nickname .

first , the name of the script and interpre@@ ter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ .@@ In this way : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / fibro@@ a / scripts in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / folders in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable , which can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document it will be file : / from the document name .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quantum number ; only one instance runs when D@@ CO@@ P is attached to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can input from &amp; quantum lus ; at the default entry , you can specify what is to send to the default entry . options are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application may also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal edition , on the standard error message . it can be specified , which should be given to the default issue written by default :
when there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . in this case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar using the name of the market .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar .
complete everything and if the day attributes has and you plan to plan your use , enable &quot; Edit &quot; Day &quot; process if available , so that an input is possible when using the action .
ignorance ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we will replace it before we have trouble .
to create a symbol that action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ icon@@ edit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics further programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; k@@ icon@@ edit : used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others .
please note , that the created symbol does not only help you to mem@@ ori@@ ze what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is mostly interpreted as a symbol ) , or should at least be interpreted by a message to the user , clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ aint ; ) and selection of the desired action . in addition to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder , in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the button button and continue to continue with other tags , as there are , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some usual &amp; quantum lus ; functions for tool@@ bar or it should set this for a better overview of some separ@@ ator in multiple groups . make sure the tool bar is selected for a better overview . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after choosing the element to be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the tool bar to the tool bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to tool bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the Start button .
the new tool bar must be tested by delivering all symbols to ensure that everything works .
back in the right folder . after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be loaded in the right folder , so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ill ; for normal users the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or form@@ atting language , which you may like to like a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ aint ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory whether someone has already done for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we need to let the do@@ cr@@ c file to you , the second part we will treat you here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , for example php@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2 = De@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html day 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html day 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such a thing :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = php@@ 42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 Select = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Getting started , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before getting started and Language Reference . this indicates that sub@@ folder is in a tree with its own content . there is no known border for the chess players ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the upper end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect &amp; lt ; sign up &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantum lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ eien will be replaced .
the content section is the range of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to display the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ ql _ fet@@ ch _ array function . for example , the documentation for the m@@ ys@@ ql _ fet@@ ch _ array parameter should be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file @-@ binding lines .
a simple list of separate context elements which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simple and save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / apps / doc / doc@@ a / doc for local or global use . then , create a folder in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
if you are sure that this good and it value are shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. , which documentation has been used to use the &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ itory for the use by the &amp; quantum lus ; but they will not be rich but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; quantum lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners , or else to whom . in different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ain@@ ees can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them correctly and useful for the publication . to make a useful contribution , what is needed for a GP@@ G / PGP key . this means that the source of resources is guaranteed for our team as well as for later users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when up@@ loading you will be asked for their own GP@@ G keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may have a look out . in the dialog of New resource you need to remain empty ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading .
the up@@ loading can also upload the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to upload tool bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts can be started .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , explo@@ res &amp; quantitative . in case of problems it warns and it can be canc@@ eled . if the integrity and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; but it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files needed in the day format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started by the DT@@ D Download and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D menu . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
objective name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the doc@@ type day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ dt@@ d should appear
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; quantum lus ; following conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; quantum lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and draw full use of &amp; qu@@ ill . this chapter attempts to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; little benefit crum@@ ble .
in &amp; quantum lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; .
global elements are for each of the &amp; quantum bodies ; use , available . by tool@@ bars about actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administ@@ rators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to each in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to tool@@ bars especially for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which provides common usage of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; quantum lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the building reviews , the maps with information and tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the box on the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current doc@@ um@@ et matching entries , such as closing the current , other or all flash@@ cards , jump or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right click in the editing area to create another context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic machining steps ( cutting / paste / paste ) , editing the file under the mouse cur@@ sor or opening the file if the string under the mouse cur@@ sor is called a file .
at the upper end of the editor you will find the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.0@@ 1 Trans@@ itional is shown as default for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ aint ; the tool bar are adapted to the new functions and thereby related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , for example &amp; lt ; in their document , click here . now you can insert the data for this just one day . should it be a day that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog of different fields .
the series views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ill ; to navigate , to navigate and to pass through . in the presentation with boxes are available for files , project , sample parts , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation modules .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ill . this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project using right click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out using the displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ill ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole web site &amp; etc ; There are all options open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are only available in the project . more templates are available .
here you will find information on the available scripts . the concept of the integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can retrieve the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send by email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on the element of an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right click of an element , a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and clearing of the tree .
this tree appears among other buildings . with it , man@@ age@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . this enables the content of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the full documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed as a project .
by default &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; two flash@@ cards at the bottom end of the window , via the beneficial information can be reached : the message window and the problem window .
this cardboard box shows information about each in Quantum a running script . so , for example , the DT@@ D used to display the current document and all changes to DT@@ D .
this cardboard box shows all mistakes in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; scripts that are executed are all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool bar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quantum lus .
another function of &amp; quantum lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar via e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar Archive via &amp; K@@ mail ; and if they get a tool bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure them and upload them as any other !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of &amp; qu@@ eting . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ill ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 folder contains . you should also make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder is . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantum lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE surface . &amp; qu@@ ain@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious and ext@@ end@@ able market editor ? well , this would make it an absolutely superb web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ill ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; it should be &amp; qu@@ ill ; it should be suitable &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim must be kept that &amp; qu@@ ay ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; develop , in good use of free software , the idea of why someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ sc@@ aff@@ s not only this is possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; so as they need it for their needs .
&amp; quantum lus ; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this enables automation almost every task . by the program Kom@@ som@@ uch , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ill . ( more information can be found here ) . ( more information can be found here ) .
&amp; quantum ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; quantum ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; quantum ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program produced .
more detailed documentation is using help : / quantum ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anti@@ a ) .
&amp; quantum ; it is currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequ@@ el @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick release list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not on it , whereby the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if they try to store selected file / text outside the local / project template , only a bug is reported .
converted to inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there are special characters for &amp; HTML ; -@@ Note , so they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as form@@ atting assignment .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; description , which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s in first line to add &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switches on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; button .
goes directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window . this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
- and Swit@@ ching on the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quantum number ; the problem rep@@ orter is activated when you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbols left of the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks using a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu , according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this enables to copy video files to your project folders or a sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ and@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quantum lus , you will find the details expl@@ aining the details .
downloads a project tool bar . these are kept in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be saved by means of settings ... and you will be saved by tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . del@@ etes it not from the hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do it .
so you can send her own tool bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus &apos; team , so the tool bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with tool@@ bar as attachment .
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you have made or someone else has made and convert to the &amp; quantum number ; own fault format .
load / prompt the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to renew , without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew it . if this global is not present and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog when there is one . this entry is always available in menu tags , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activated or activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this works only with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insert means that &amp; qu@@ ill means : inser@@ ting by tool@@ bar , if this day is contra@@ dic@@ tory to the rules this day .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above mentioned menu points . click on . please click on an activated plug @-@ in .
select the syntax error mode for the current file . the list of available herr@@ ing schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version ab .
choose type of line @-@ end passwords . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using external use Ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . by some limitations in the KDE libraries can sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the display in &amp; qu@@ aint ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . with selection of a paper the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches on the status bar at the bottom edge of the &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialogue affects any application that use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ web browser .
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears where you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or adding to which you can change and follow the sequences .
this should create a help according to the mouse button , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; quantum lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; development in financial form can be found here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from above , as after completing the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; quantum number ; -@@ Project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository .
here you can access the server address of the machine that you want to access , except one edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemplary ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log will be used . depending on the remote computer &apos;s setting , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection is used for various projects , this folder should rather be used instead of the standard .
this is the folder that will be saved in the tool@@ bars for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection is used for various projects , this folder should rather be used instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folders .
this setting is great if you want to download and change static web content you want to change and change . if you want to change or modify scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
employees , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be cons@@ ulted . if a project is started ane@@ w on new , not rush .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of man@@ di@@ cs .
this shows a list of files in root folders . you can select the desired files through plug@@ g@@ ks or , by removing the bun@@ ks , exp@@ ul@@ sion from the project .
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with the Project Properties Project Properties in Sub@@ frame Profile or with the Shift Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ame ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
supplementary option to above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded during opening of the project . can be read more about project views .
for this you can select the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in the error correction is described .
in sub@@ window profiles upload , high load profiles ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , by showing a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration you can switch the event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions . event actions will be executed if a previous event happens , just like the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced currently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to open another project , select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project or open the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Project or the Symbol project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialogue project is displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when &amp; Tw@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving , when &amp; qu@@ aint ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , however the entries open and open with ... in the right mouse button open context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files .
allows to remove the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent removing .
the password will keep in the core memory and forget the program . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading of files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password on the record does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ist@@ lus ; many high load profiles are created and so the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ io Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS .
the port for transfer . normally this must not be changed except the network administrator runs a service not on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time saving function or a risk . use it according to your discretion . the password will be saved on the plate , so that it can &apos;t be easily read , but everybody with programming skills can easily be seen in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the current files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored in the menu or the project tool@@ bar , accessible or deleted via settings tool@@ bar tool bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ill , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase the productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quantum lus ; at your own work .
as mentioned above are the tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ anti@@ es ; best over the menu tool@@ bar . use and adding are different . adding tool bars are handled down in the section Add of tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols on them can be adjusted either by context menu ( right click on tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool bar can be applied , tool bar ren@@ aming or tool@@ bar , which can be specified in the dialog , where can be specified , which should be displayed on this or other tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will remove and re@@ worked action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars and set settings .. .
templates are in essential document skel@@ et@@ ets , code car@@ ving and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ap@@ lus ; used in principle like a common fil@@ esystem with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , shift or any at the system existing directory in the storage space . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ill ; in about the limitations you are presented for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; quantum lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template .
binary is all that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; bin@@ aries are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples will be found under global templates . more information about the templates tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , special documents are created for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found under global templates . see for more information about templates .
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document will be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area is always included in the documents . some examples are available in the pre @-@ storage space under global templates . see for more information about templates .
as the name says , these templates are used for all websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quantum lus .
design a document structure according to supply ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As a template to store as a local template ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it is stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the project tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on File As a template to store selection as local / repository . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with drag and placing on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file only goes into a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as pulling and paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can choose the file tree or in the project files to create a folder right and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure a name for the template , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented gateway . you can pre @-@ insert header lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , insert files or combine with them . in addition , some things can be kept very deep in projects using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files specified in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates . each of these folders is equal to one of four types of containers , as described above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , click the Fol@@ der overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended as soon as el@@ eventh attributes is ab@@ ated .
this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts for everything except the regular folders in the template list . if a regular folder wouldn &apos;t be enabled , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text box . if nothing appears , it &apos;s probably in a regular folder .
allows pre@@ set or im@@ printed text for templates in this folder . this could be general header lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows to fit in a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers a whole presentation with the appropriate head@@ lines / foot lines .
in addition , you have a context menu ( click on the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; quantum lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code Editor , which are accessible via the menu view . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second share the Edit@@ or@@ window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and turn back to the source code in which the changes made to the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to change the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works as well as the first one , except that at the same time the changes in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously operates . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , then the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ sor is already active from a window to another , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ ization by one click or automatically . in general , the recommended dosage can be adjusted . in principle , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computers and a large sp@@ anne for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so you can select the documentation of documentation to work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called . it is used to change the source code :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information on the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list enables the amend@@ ment of the In@@ hal@@ tes , such as keywords on the column name and keyword key@@ wor@@ t@@ 2 on the contents -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the list below the list or delete a change over the list . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is as in a text processing , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves as usual . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and can be deleted by typ@@ ing R@@ Ü@@ CK@@ TA@@ ST@@ E or distance c@@ aste .
the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way through the tool@@ bars , such as in the source code editor , e.g. if an anchor day is not removed , e.g. if an anchor day is inserted with text , any other restri@@ al anchor day must be removed .
some work@@ places like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for testing style sheets . in contrast to other programs for sty@@ list , search for specific elements is possible and the execution of the style template can be followed .
to comp@@ ile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; you need to comp@@ ile , save &amp; k@@ de ; nor the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt libraries , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without p@@ ad@@ ress . file name in the same folder as the first loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a breast@@ feeding file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a Vor@@ age named QNAP or a specified module name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agre@@ es with any of the QNAP who contains the string template .

a sought @-@ in fixing point must be dissolved for the corresponding UR@@ I and line number . this will be automatically re@@ checked when charging the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each run .

there are many graphical tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ing many changes did , and at the same time , a further programmer had changed a lot of text changes in the same file .
the program used by myself only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the entry had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of more useful functions have been added later .
if you want to quickly compare text , just copy it to the clip@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function which made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a complete file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge will be fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently in one piece of co@@ de and make changes in the original file . in this editor you can even edit the result . at the same time , you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three source files at merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and identify with the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , one can see at a glance at the Sum@@ mary table in the column at the left side . ( no trouble anymore when somebody changes the rear . )
if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicate which file varies . red color means that both files are different .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , then you can make the ti@@ pping work easier by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 2 @-@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 1 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the Open dialog allows the manual ti@@ pping of file names to select from the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file once again ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; above the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge folders . if you select a file , for B and C , a folder will then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when mer@@ ges are crossed , the input field is active and editing itself . however , it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the same / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare an entire file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . in the opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and insert them : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which idea is behind it ? sometimes , one file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would need to download it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; and then compare it . now you can easily copy , paste and compare these relevant sections .
note : currently you can do nothing out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drop out text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and dis@@ card text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the Info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional ) , let the mouse rest a while on line . then a small relief window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to letters A , B and C . a colour is blue , B the colour green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is recognized , one sees in the color , which file differs . if both files distinguish , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( merge ) good .
left next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . for some programming languages , the color is not so important , only the relevant changes to see . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line , separ@@ ating the summary column , is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines . if the line breaks is enabled , the line to broken lines is scored .
the result window ( among the compar@@ ators ) also has a info @-@ line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , Save is disabled ! ! ! ( use buttons at the lowest dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this group will be highlighted in the windows where the group is not visible . ) This group will be highlighted in the color background color for the current area and a black beam appears .
sometimes , through automatic merge or through manual editing no more line more in the group ; then it is only a wild@@ card for the event that you can change your mind and maybe another source appears . this text appears neither in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er you may copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; summar@@ izing ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . carefully check this function .
note : when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ates mainly with the image run and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the windows , you can also use the arrow keys , side , at the beginning , at the end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ end can also be used by clicking on the vertical image bar .
in the eye window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and over@@ writ@@ able mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary column synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as already in the section merge and the ed@@ itable installation window was explained ) .
the tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ down / C@@ trl @-@ picture off ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ below / C@@ trl @-@ Image Se@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict also conflict . therefore , between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflicts can be distinguished .
to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this option is activated , you will be automatically deleted , automatically over@@ write to the clip@@ board . be careful with this option , because you could acci@@ dentally write the contents of the clip@@ board .
lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a push @-@ slide sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use c@@ line function \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 re@@ tains the line @-@ up of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and list of the recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu Adjust@@ ment Un@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences in ital@@ ics are displayed . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be bl@@ ast@@ ically displayed . on these systems the button will automatically display an odd colour .
if this option is enabled , the tab button is inserted into the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a tab card will be inserted .
if you press entering or return , the entering the previous line is automatically used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , every selection will automatically copy into the clip@@ board . manually copy the clip@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly usual selection on the operating system used .
in the same move , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters may be ignored . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when assem@@ bling , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a truck indication of &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , others will only store a row in advance &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is activated , Wag@@ en@@ revers@@ al signs can be visible , however , as a white sign must be disabled . during the merge , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . however , the differences will still be displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sively after some smaller differences , the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic re@@ boot mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed , before the next time conflict continues to jump .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if you require that the automatic selection of many files are less important when selecting the options , ignore or ignore the options for numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning folders and merge . check for details below documentation for the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and an older version exists , then the original version of the suff@@ ix is displayed . if already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix . original , it will be deleted without additional backup .
adap@@ ting the user interface language . changing this option does not concern the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; this option is active in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set globally through the control center . )
the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if one activ@@ ates this option , the upper settings will be used for all entries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the selection fields for the encoding appears a short note that the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has an inform@@ al character for you . ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
custom@@ ize the file encoding for source files . this is how special characters handled and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which coding for saving can be used here .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not have to function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can only handle 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the default command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the coding of the output commands .
switch on this for changes in white characters in the text or review process . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color@@ fully coded over@@ clock column are displayed . however , you may only see the differences between two of three files ; C , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; C ; C will be displayed with the information required .
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison window next to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and use the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , then the name of the last used output file is retained . )
when reading a file it will be given first to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function for example , to remove distur@@ bing parts or correct the inser@@ tion .
when reading a file it is given to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is given ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which matches exactly your demands . every input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this command to convert the input in capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; in the replacement string .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically created strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . this is , therefore , a pre @-@ process command for line @-@ off is required . the \ \ \ _ BAR _ Author \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ \ _ BAR _ header \ \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ \ _ BAR _ file \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ _ BAR _ Date \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \
while you are experim@@ enting with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing command for Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ equally suitable . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a match , and every hits will be replaced with nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might need to perform several objectives at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the equ@@ ations from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / switch &apos; Ho@@ wever , per@@ l some details differently . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and to merge . further operations only change the data that the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ yss @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , text changes or differences hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
often , program@@ mers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders using &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without having to do it ,
... guides selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of single files . you only need to open folder on command line or dialog .
if three folders are merged then folder 1 is used as base . if no target folders is specified , uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; Fol@@ der 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not merge the merge . to launch the merge , you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
during the reading of the folder , you will inform you a small message window on the current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files will be listed below .
when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and every folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - or click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the directory contains two functions and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open up all the folders .
if you double click on a file , the file disk will be started and a comparison window appears .
the column in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in other folders , then this is visible in the column A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action will not be chosen automatically . if the merge will start , you will be informed about any problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are used in the columns A / B / C colors red , green , yellow and black .
in identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical when all its content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , the age is in@@ significant for its colour .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green then yellow and later , when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copying A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ t@@ less objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A file and B file is ) : error : contra@@ dic@@ tory data types . as long as such faul@@ t@@ less objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ izing is active when only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders are given . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the required action , so after that both folders are identical . if used for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user looks as a visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after exec@@ uting &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and then select the option New File instead of merge ( uns@@ afe ) , then the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange cannot be removed , the merge can not be started .
during the merge , a file is processed after the other . the status column shows Fer@@ tig when the merge has been successful , and according to other messages if something unexpected has been completed , you should make a last check and see if the status is all right .
when in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only indicated when three folders compared or merged . )
you can select either the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all of the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have no target folder , then it will be used in the three @-@ file merge mode C as a target in the two @-@ file merge will be chosen B as target and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B as target .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder . there are some options which might be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to summar@@ ize all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ note ) . to execute just the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the contra@@ dic@@ tory data types are still invalid , a message appears that points to incorrect elements . you can then select a valid promotion .
when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options passing , sim@@ ulate and breaking .
select Sim@@ ulations when you want to see what would happen without the really changes would happen . you will then receive an exhau@@ st@@ ive list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen photo ) .
if you are finished with a file , select or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . if you have the option to select a different action for the entry or resolve the problem in other ways before attemp@@ ting to merge with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries are not recorded ( in the current session ) and will not be saved once again . even if the co@@ operating result has been recorded or not saved , these entries will be done as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be re @-@ led again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that are displayed on the indicated pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is not to match this pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are also ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a ver@@ b attribute . in other file systems , a leading point is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
in links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links display . this is disabled in default .
in links to Fol@@ der : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folders will result in a file that would result in a junction ( or diff@@ 3 ; crash@@ es ) This option is switched off in the default .
performs a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns . ( the number dissolved , un@@ necessarily , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ sample ) .
if you compare a large file via a slow network , it may be quicker to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed benefit is a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is checked in default .
similarly to trust the change date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical . this option can be useful for example when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is checked in default .
activ@@ ating the synchron@@ izing mode if two folders are compared and no target folders are specified . in this mode , the proposals will be identical in both folders . this option is also stored in both folders . this option is set off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this will be considered in@@ secure because the other file is not changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is checked in the default .
if a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file , the original version will be renamed . if an old backup file is changed with the .@@ original file , this will also affect the normal merge of individual files , not only the merge whole folder . this option is enabled in the default .
normally the folder merge mode remains visible to the merge of individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want , you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch the change between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double click . however , there is also an appropriate menu entry . you can also set up a single file directly , without being able to manage the file , and the file will not run again when you run the file .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : new directory : read new
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders , which are on local or remote computer .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line resembles a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has other syntax as local files and folders . a few things should please note :
a path can be relatively . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank draw &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes , due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a brief list of the limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . hence , soak the per@@ missions or change date from the original . ( please refer to the option in the size of the size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently the differences in K@@ Dev@@ elop . K@@ Dev@@ elop first starts to start the built @-@ in differences . in order to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the differences and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a node . then , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files in Uni@@ fied format . then , and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since generation of patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , as part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the merge or the same of folders is not supported in part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now he@@ is Com@@ pare ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 is already pointing out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot to look into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or going to go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably don &apos;t have the right pre@@ fix to KDE . in the pre@@ set , KDE installed in / us@@ r / local but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find further information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white character is treated as identical , the line is not treated as un@@ identical . i@@ F @-@ lines , next to each other , this is the v@@ ein O@@ FT@@ EN the case .
the editor tells you for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends . this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format which could store this information .
the effort was too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process large amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is sudden , no sr@@ c left ; released and the text can not be ext@@ ingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already use many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and l@@ acks the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source package .
um &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution :
KDE @-@ dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are uns@@ ure you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should not have any problems when comp@@ iling . should trouble occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Um@@ bre@@ l Rem@@ ove ) into the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current mark@@ er .
only differences : files identical in all folders does not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you need to update the folder to these options by updating the update . )
only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . if the target folder does not contain these files in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , it is likely to change according to the merge file . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is checked in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with labels A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the outcome window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be removed accordingly when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ standing in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini@@ preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to stop her size or move it . this works both inside a desktop and also several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in the applications . applications can be selected and even moving on desktop and other .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work@@ spaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click here , the context menu only has to set up the two entries in P@@ ager ; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as entries to minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and end .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . appears only when clicked on a application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when clicked on a application .
if this check box is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on desktop and also to other work areas .
if this field is crossed , the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager is displayed ; the names of the virtual working areas are displayed .
tick this rim makes the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displaying the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . is it together with name display , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
if this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed in order to allow their selection .
here is the view of the program window . simple direc@@ ting with the propor@@ tions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard icon and pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n grid , all virtual work@@ spaces are available in a horizontal row ; horizont@@ ally , shows all virtual working areas in a vertical range , which is very good for the representation of the sides on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature program in the Control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or by its content and it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select setup from switch switches ... lets dialog appear settings .
currently it cannot be changed in the dialog settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must enter the key wind@@ ow@@ Transpar@@ ent mode and assign it to this file . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
if you &amp; k@@ likes ; start , appears a window as shown above . below is shown the enlarged area of the screen . in the following this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . in the below is shown this window as a magni@@ fying window . the image that is shown in the magni@@ fication window is a larger area of the screen and is described in the following as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ may ; the area around the mouse cur@@ sor as an mov@@ able magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can create &amp; k@@ mag ; it causes a select screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( eg ; on the left edge of screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cur@@ sor in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor . please note that &amp; k@@ may ; currently not capable of recogni@@ zing the shape of the mouse . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cur@@ sor .
in selection mode , you can adjust the drop window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the content of the magni@@ fying driver and move . this also goes with the arrow keys .
in addition , press &amp; Shift ; press the &amp; M@@ MB button , you can move the drop down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the drop window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is stuck and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to copy into a file , turning into the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cur@@ i@@ fies a while on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and where any mouse click is pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click on the same spot as soon as the mouse cur@@ i@@ fies a while on the same place . it is intended to em@@ ulate people who em@@ ulate the mouse in the repet@@ itive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) . however , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain when clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you suffer pain that are related to the use of your computer , should you consult a doctor if this is not done .
to get it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps to get created when clicking with mouse , it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse button as soon as you break the movement briefly .
if the intelligent shift is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break when it is done . move the mouse button before turning the mouse button . in this way , you can run pulling in an impressive mouse button . the smart di@@ pping requires a little exercise , but you get used to get used quickly .
this wei@@ ght@@ time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click leads .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es shift is enabled , the time is set off ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before moving the mouse button , before turning the mouse button , if there is no indication of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking on the mouse button . this function is activated by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow way to the left and back is saved , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt files are launched , but the first time has started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move on to sh@@ orten the reaction time . open the sound system and here the rider General . there is a slide sound buffer , which you can adjust to a lower value in order to reduce the response times .
if this setting is checked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will start at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; please note the respective documentation to rate to find out how to automatically start a program automatically .
set all the settings on the values used when opening the dialog . have you already pushed the button user to reset the settings after the last push of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; initially with the prefer@@ ences . in particular , smart shifts should be used at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse , you can later take the intelligent shift .
if you use the audible click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds .
first , you should consci@@ ously make a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not display a link . you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse completes , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you can not just clean the mouse , but also the roles to get in touch with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies from mouse to mouse . it should be clear , however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or the fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in very rare situations the operating system is inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you just have a shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , means that operation no longer can end by the release of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is reset to the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor to another spot .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor in place where you want to place it . if you don &apos;t want to adjust the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you are not able to cause the mouse cur@@ sor . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the titles of windows .
I try to work with smart shifts , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text .
the intelligent diversity is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes his time to copy it to copy , paste it into the clip@@ board , or do any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but there will probably be some advice to them . here are some advice :
do not use smart shifts , if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead as follows : perform a mouse click here , while you move the mouse cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and re @-@ press the mouse button again .
use the audible mouse click . this makes every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button puts a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the smart shifts starts using it . however , you can also use intelligent diversity without the audible mouse click . however , it requires some exercise .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to install the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X windows ; this should be the case in most systems .
the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker , and it is set correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; sof@@ ten the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor is canc@@ eled . this program was designed for people who suffer from RS@@ I syndrome , and those who prepare the massage of the bri@@ ghtest pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain amount of time that a pulling process begins , before the mouse is detached . in this way , it can also be carried out with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ my users to let your computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; allows dum@@ my users to let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the discussions that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( left screenshot ) , enter the command which will later be used for the speech output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second side you can choose the standard text pass@@ agen@@ furt . from the text pass@@ age@@ way you can choose often used text passages without having to type it . the passages can be processed naturally .
on the third side ( right screen photo ) , you specify the dictionary of the chosen language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can add the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that it can only be described correctly for the Wor@@ ds of Wor@@ ds .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically a input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a running memory of the already spoken phrases ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
if you k@@ mouth ; correctly set up , you can enter the phrases you want to listen . any spoken set is attached to the disk memory . you can select from these phrases which should be spoken again .
the Settings menu Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two cards , voice guidance and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ism and the page K@@ TT@@ SD Language Service .
in the input field of the cards , enter the command to call the language generator . in the box under the input field you specify the character encoding to be passed to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be dis@@ closed as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed as parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output from your language generator depends on . you can find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
to use as a language service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the additional settings will be available on this page . if this option is now useful , the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
the first selection box action after the selection of a text passage you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ note or by choosing a text passage in the Menu Text@@ pass@@ agen@@ furt .
with the selection of So@@ fort , the selected text passage will be directly spoken and added in the box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
with the second selection box Close the editing window for text pass@@ agen@@ furt @-@ book you can specify whether the text box can be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pass@@ agen@@ furt book store the book will be saved . if you select changes , the text pass@@ agen@@ furt will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ agen@@ furt will be saved .
the page Wor@@ ter@@ Supplement is a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ds . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field you can select the currently used dictionary on the wording .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add them to change the order of the books or export it into a file . below the list , you can set the language in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the required language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the &amp; k@@ mouth . in addition , you can compare the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can compare the word list using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add just written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are collected , and how these will be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you specify a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new added words automatically add into the dictionary , generate a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ ers is two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated key collection . if you choose a text file book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books can be accessed either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text pass@@ ers or text passages can be changed by pulling the mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied into the clip@@ board . if the text is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected ranges of the running memory .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if the text is selected in the input field , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected ranges of the running memory .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of running stor@@ k .
if this menu entry is crossed , a mov@@ able tool bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . by default , the tool bar is mounted directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sli@@ pped left side and drag the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window with notes on the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , the bar is displayed directly under the editing window . the bar is directly arranged via the editing window directly under the tool bar . by clicking on the sli@@ pped left side and pulling the tool bar can be moved to another spot .
probably you have entered the command for voice output not correctly or not fully entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up the Site General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the map edition . ( see Settings dialog for Language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
Festival is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the festival free of charge and further distribute restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival in the folder / us@@ r / local / festival is installed . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently , he only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / us@@ r / local / fre@@ aks . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option has to be turned on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . he converts a list of phon@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assum@@ ption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / us@@ r / local / hadi@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / mb@@ ro@@ la .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to send the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples :

the VO @-@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service provided for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since setting the language generator takes place only in the TT@@ SD , you only need to use the kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to specify the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but depends on your computer and configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot speak with the people who can &apos;t speak English text by the computer . it will be saved a list already pro@@ filed phrases which allows users to re@@ produce new expend@@ itu@@ res .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language syn@@ thesizer contains . on the machine a language syn@@ thesizer must be installed .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( give either this URL to the address bar of &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - The voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules existing service that allows every application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities . also the users also offers interesting options .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; also when &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
the speech is done via the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , the various background program like es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the creation of speech spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ relief program .
in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Speech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Speech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Meta @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice @-@ edition of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; offers .
a application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and installation of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can also find the list on htt@@ ps : / / email .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / email info / k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility . the developer can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ Acc@@ essibility ) .
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; you have to install and properly set the program for speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as yet no speakers are set up , the card speaker is displayed . see also if you have at least one speaker , the card card is displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different males or female subjects . they can also set up multiple variants for one syn@@ thesizer . you should also set up multiple variants for one syn@@ thesizer . you should at least use a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is used otherwise the standard speakers .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to multiple printers for the same printer .
when you click on the flash@@ card speaker in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . it will then appear automatically when you start a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet no speaker is set up .
all furnished speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no spokes@@ man for the speech .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click on the list , and click on this button to push the speaker on the list a line further down . the order of the actors in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
choose a vocal type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boys and girls .
if you click here , appears on the new spokes@@ man on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaking speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops ; already almost use . go back to the Car@@ TS Service of &amp; k@@ de . see . now you can select &amp; kt@@ ops . click here to read and manage text file . please click on the card card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can launch the voice command system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card key to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this start is successful , and you can create text orders and read text orders , and you can hold text orders , and you can hold text orders and read the T@@ TS @-@ System from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , run &amp; kt@@ ops ; further , if the field speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is tagged and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control panel , it disappears again once the pre@@ read is complete .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop , stop and record again .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to preview . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides .
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cards and check the speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the displayed web page . check first if &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . check the text that should be read and then select the text output . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ cable lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can pre @-@ read the text editor . check first whether &amp; kt@@ ops ; runs . then check the text that should be read out and then select the text output . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ il@@ a ; .
K@@ Not@@ ify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will notify you of informed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ops .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various kinds of messages . for example , you can be informed that you indicate your nickname once in a IR@@ C channel . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Not@@ ify , appears a menu not@@ if@@ ications in the Settings menu of this program . the here possible settings for K@@ Not@@ ify differ depending on the application .
filter for strings offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ops ; incorrect or incorrect to correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is sent to delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent to K@@ Mail , and additionally the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted as required in most cases . read also .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
in Fil@@ ters , text is edited before being sent to program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select in@@ correctly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to select matching language and speakers , or to b@@ ypass certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the working methods of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds those orders . if output of the Screen reader is read , the orders received will be continued again .
warnings are the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will be continued after the warning of the warning .
News have the nights of the top priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; k@@ mouth ; a long text can be read on a web site , you can easily enter the room . &amp; k@@ mouth ; not@@ if@@ ications are also news . read about it .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you want to print from the card card is a word order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts , which have no special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the edition of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ops ; just such a read , this edition will stop and end .
first you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they will be applied to normal warnings , news and text orders as well as &amp; k@@ de ; messages are applied .
filter process the text and give it further to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are done as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . sending parts can be displayed either as words or as regular expressions . it will be made using text or as regular expressions as : - ) by text or for form@@ atting news from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; K@@ mail ; in a better understood form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with speaker selection filters , you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that have set the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have set up a female voice on the card , you can read the text by KDE messages about it . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a speech output . if the filter is determined that its rules can not apply , it remains the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters , which are placed on the side down . the processing by the filter is performed in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be turned upwards down@@ wards from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of fil@@ tering , and it will display the following setup dial@@ ogs .
to set a list of words or regular expressions , you need to input a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the matching text . large and low @-@ note case is not considered when compared .
type a name for your filter . you can choose this name freely , it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string in the column he@@ ap . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , files are attached from the file to the existing list .
if a language is registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the word order is published here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages when clicking the mouse click the &amp; C@@ trl ; button hold down .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only used if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can input several programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , K@@ mail
you can receive the program ID running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers have to leave you . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , you can only enter the ID @-@ ID @-@ 34@@ 32 .
the string replacement filter will only apply to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison of words , the string rec@@ essed filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ding signs ( space ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular expressions can be found in the package .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former transl@@ ates &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3C standard for such revers@@ als . it can only be installed on well @-@ formed XML .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the microphone selection filter you can send texts to a particular speaker that is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain traits . you may define , for example , that text from K@@ Mail will be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text to the filter passes , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected for the text editor that provides the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; sends , and the properties of the spokesperson on the card speaker , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker .
if the text is used here , the filter is applied , if the text has the entered regular expression . it is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can use it with a click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of string , i.e. , start the regular expression of &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here , specify the properties of the desired microphone . if the text is filled the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , which matches the desired requirements at the moment . click on the right to show the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store or load your speech settings , or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only apply to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter when apply . you must enter at least one constra@@ int .
the VO API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD on &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer added to K@@ TT@@ SD so that &amp; kt@@ ops are able to use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section includes a short description of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; . the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the k@@ de ; Acc@@ essibility Website ( htt@@ p : / / acc@@ essi@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for language controls via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from program kt@@ am to the object K@@ Speech .
this is text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; kon@@ ose ; -@@ windows . start the kt@@ ops in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so that you do not need to do so if you use this voice to read from websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and above the environment variable PAT@@ H is found .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that all movements are ski@@ pped or only che@@ w@@ aged . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the string encoding is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be solved by a string replacement filter . see .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own a separate license .
if you have access to the KDE source code , you can get the package k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can find it in the folder . you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / speci@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
KT@@ TS also works with any language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that can be launched in a &amp; con@@ sole command line .
the list of languages listed above may be incomplete or dated . therefore , please see the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops ; for use of another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile , you need a recent development environment of KDE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ops , please refer to the source repository for k@@ de@@ acc@@ essibility or have downloaded the Tar@@ ball up to date , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ops ; check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language syn@@ thesizer . you can use the script script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops used . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be so developed that the program is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text will dis@@ assemble in individual sentences . the user can re@@ iter@@ ate Satan or sat@@ in , repeat the output or cancel the issue .
if an application is submitted to &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , it may request the properties of the preferred spokes@@ man for the output . if you want a speaker , its language is English and whose family is female , otherwise it will be the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker is chosen , see you in .
if you click on the card speaker , click Add , and put a speaker on the list or click Edit Pan@@ e . as an example , the card speaker setup is displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details on the modules can be found below .
enter the path to the executable festival program . if the path is included in PAT@@ H you only need to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that will be handed over to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops are made , this setting will be done automatically . generally , western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these shooting dealers , you make volume , talk speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some kno@@ b , and this grey you can &apos;t select these settings .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n @-@ Vo@@ ices need to be loaded due to their size several seconds . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( when greater memory consumption ) the first set will be made faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker ( or forgot to click Apply ) .
if this check box is marked , in the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window is displayed , but not the program window is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is still not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the option to read or otherwise control it .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the precisely fixed set . the speaker ID is the column ID on the card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can go back on behalf , which is selected in the list below , forward or going back . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card box audio . see also .
here only text orders are performed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the appropriate audio module , or ec@@ lec@@ ts ; can &apos;t load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en will be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . have you selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
put the microphone speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ x must be installed .
click Apply to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M machines and modules that are furnished in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this map you can set special promotions that will always be executed if the word order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of voice entries :
the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds those orders . after the issue of the Screen Reader has been read , the orders received will be resumed .
warnings are the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . warning will keep the output of messages and regular text . these orders will be continued after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of applying to the messages . if you have &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcoming , who enters the room just .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file is always played when a normal word order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound are being active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card card only apply to normal text orders . for news , warnings , and the editions of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Not@@ ify messages can be read , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on al@@ er@@ ts . the card not@@ if@@ ications appears .
check this check box in order to switch off &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads no not@@ if@@ ications before .
this setting is marked , not@@ if@@ ications for which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and select the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sends , if someone mentioned your nickname in a IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ops ; do if an event applies . you have the following selection options :
if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . default choose the speaker that is shown in the list on the card speaker as top entry . see also .
note that there are three planes for events . if there is a specific event of a certain application , this is executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all the other events of the particular application . as the last option the action is made to fru@@ ition which was established under standard ( all other events ) .
the event all not@@ if@@ ications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the notification settings as follows :
use the button Save to load the settings for al@@ er@@ ts to a file . use the events associated with the events in the list . if you want to start using an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all alert will be deleted .
the Speech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling the voice of voice , speech , and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival used in the SS@@ ML output .
if the settings for speed or tape in the festival configuration dialog does not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; htt@@ p / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / / W@@ 3C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mom . who has slept in my bed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked my bed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#93; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . therefore , the first set must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole word order . thus , you can also stop or jump or break , even if the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are not supported directly .
here you see the Sat@@ z@@ bor@@ der@@ recognis@@ able filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops are automatically set up . you can change its settings , or add further Sat@@ is@@ faction filter , but beginners will not be advised .
the easiest way to learn the setup selection through out . switch on the card selection and select text to read . please switch on the card selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then the first set can be processed , as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long .
you will then keep text orders placed on the card card or cancel orders , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set @-@ limit@@ er filter will automatically set up if you launch kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , you can &apos;t have anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
reference filter compare text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the set limits ( tabl@@ ing signs are automatically removed from the fil@@ tering ) . note that the default of the standard lock filter maintains the character .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( cold ) , warnings , news or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .

check this check box if the property should have priority before other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is , it is always used as a priority property . you will probably use this property . if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the message introduced in the working environment .
to put all the properties in the area speaker that matches the following below , click on the select button , and then use speakers that matches the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a copy number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) .

on the map audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program SO@@ x has to be installed and above the environment variable PAT@@ H will be able to provide a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you &apos;re totally brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and put the microphone speed up .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can adjust volume , talk speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops .
you must install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male brit@@ ish ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code for the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or a new ahead . when you set up the Russian voices , you need to set up the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you have the Russian voices you need to set for the Vo@@ ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distribution distri@@ butions . look for the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the coding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; syn@@ thesizer is used . then the festival takes the le@@ x@@ ik@@ ori@@ ental analysis and &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; it creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ ro@@ la ; -@@ Vo@@ ices can be downloaded from

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows management of network interfaces , routines and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to provide users managing the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu ; launched .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware doesn &apos;t have to install and configure any physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all apparent and the setting of the network features enabled .
in most cases , drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added to installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network devices later added , the drivers need to be loaded with the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network interface settings will be loaded when the option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is chosen . when starting the module network settings this is attemp@@ ting to detect the platform on the system automatically .
if the platform can not be recognized , the spring selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date can be hit permanently . by selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ inquiries , setting the network settings will then be pre@@ set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system administ@@ rating mode . before , all options are displayed in the system administration mode . in the system administration mode , change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you will be able to adjust the button mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password .
in system administration mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the tab network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface and set up in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Settings button to display the following possibilities .
with the selection of Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are produced by a DH@@ CP Server or BO@@ O@@ TP Server . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server automatically sends all the required TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further setting is required . in the list box , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
with the selection Manu@@ ally without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be made the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask is determined .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values given in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network . the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ ose ; you can determine whether the desired address is already used . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off if required . switching an output network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or off on demand . switch off a activated network device through selecting from the list and click interface .
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networking and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subjects .
if the computer is more than a network interface , the interface to the web is to be selected in which the gateway computer can be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses . if the computer requires htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS solves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for the nam@@ ing resolution of this list resolution enables simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be arranged by selecting an application and execution or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list using the buttons or down@@ wards in the priority .
by clicking the button add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver dialog .
first you have to set the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click Edit button .... It will display the dialog .
the name designated computer describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily when bo@@ oting , if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server .
normally contains the list well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses will support . this is still in the test version of IP is to replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add to Add the New Testament dialog .
enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button . if the familiar computer has multiple alias name , de button will press several times and enter the other alias name .
select an entry of a well @-@ known host@@ name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog box will display .
you can run one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated .
the settings provided in the module settings are not immediately available in the system . to activate the changes you need to set in a &amp; kon@@ ose ; the following command must be removed .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ con@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply to download the rpm package and in one &amp; kon@@ ose ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient , but also the development packages are required for libraries and other things .
this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should be done .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given on basic network technology , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never been found great spread . IPv@@ 6 is expected to pass through it in the near future . this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is attri@@ but@@ able . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact address given to a valid IP address , or if available , DH@@ CP can not be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily . definitely , the IP address cannot be chosen arbit@@ rar@@ ily !
when placing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the range from 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 192.16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .0.0 and 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP transmission .
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.0@@ .0@@ .1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works as a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files containing &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; are affected and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL links a different content than specified there .
for &amp; SuSE ; it is well known that this file is modified by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ ony . another stand can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first target was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of d@@ ds@@ 2@@ tar to fast , sel@@ ective cut@@ back . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife did : how much longer does it take ?
before a tape can be used , it must be connected by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; trains the band back and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing of the band . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the credits not on the band are asked if the band will be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the credits are looking for the right index on your record . can &apos;t this be found , you will be asked if the band index is new to be created .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol of the tape drives , to indicate that the band has been embedded . in the stat@@ us@@ bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps up the band .
before throwing the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; specifies a change to the band to recognise that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked out without danger .
before a tape &amp; k@@ dat ; can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
a band modes have to be format@@ ted before you use to store data . this process does not need to be format@@ ted before using the tape &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not have to be format@@ ted before you use the tape by &amp; k@@ dat ; however , floppy tape drives are usually not set to form@@ ulate DA@@ T drives .
after entering the band called and the capacity , &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the band . all data on the band are lost ! after the conclusion of the form@@ atting process the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup procedure , you have to select the backup files . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is secured .
mark a secure profile profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in local file tree with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
with the right mouse button , click on the local file tree and select the back@@ drop in the menu ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup .
when you have confirmed the settings dialog , dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time .
mark a file or a folder in one of the archives associated with the drive . it will only be checked the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives associated with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
click with the right mouse button in one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog settings for checking . in this dialog you can check out your selection once and change the work@@ folder for review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog shows the progress of the test process and the data flow and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before entering the restore , the files must be restored , marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the disk volume . it will only be restored the selected file or the sub@@ folder .
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a check box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
with the right mouse button , click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .
once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for restoration . in this dialog you can check out your selection once and change the work@@ folder for restoration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you have confirmed the settings for the recovery , the dialog appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog shows the progress of re@@ viewing and the data flow and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re @-@ create the band inde@@ x@@ file on the basis of the tape . this process del@@ etes all existing In@@ dex@@ files for this band . you can re@@ produce the index to two types of tape :
this will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make a safety profile the following settings :
the current work@@ folder , where the backup is to be done . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected work@@ folder .
for all folders that are listed under securing files , that only the files can be secured on the same file system , as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can enter separately under securing files . each entry is recognized by tar regardless of the other file system files .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will be used since the last incre@@ mental backup . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to change the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; files ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in menu settings . the following settings can be made :
the complete path to the device file system ( normally / dev / Tape ) . this path must refer to non @-@ reaction version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , convey@@ s &amp; k@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command will be switched to the drive . for some drives this is necessary to be performed before reading or write operations .
if the option is switched on , &amp; k@@ dat ; unlock the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all band drives .
if the option is switched on , it is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded to the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the tape . do not use this option for floppy streaming .
if the option is enabled , it is trying to change &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band work will be notified .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , write a file to the start of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the file is set up as follows :
( n byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is machine name : seconds , where computer name is the full name of the system , on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the ep@@ och has been format@@ ted in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ archives that can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not around incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for unwanted users where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in the various protocol . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the program is suitable for unwanted users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows users to provide fast access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore try to provide some advanced functions using their help to filtered the protocol @-@ files certain programs filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log has a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in this manual and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; k@@ integ@@ log ; functions are available , with their help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a Protocol file can be fil@@ tering and sort . the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the launch , &amp; k@@ systematic log ; first the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system log file is launched , and it opens instead of Linux normally in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or in the filter bar . the list of log @-@ lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only log @-@ line display will be displayed next to the selected filter . then a log line is displayed only if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term .
you can also select a different entry at this point . if the string of the filter search term will only be selected with entries in accordance to the selected column , and in addition , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines which have been sent or created from this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . record lines of level error are displayed with a plain color as protocol @-@ lines of the level reference . the color presentation of protocol @-@ lines can be connected to setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can then be useful to examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process process . this may be useful for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the option to create new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ menu , select a Log in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ systematic log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ char@@ .@@ D@@ ort you will find more information about the removal sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion Archives : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the V In@@ it system rapidly develops into the standard for checking the system start of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to implement a machine on System V In@@ it without a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was there one .
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that the config files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d includes a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start the system or change at a different run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ pd &amp; etc ; system services do not include such stuff like set@@ serial , which is only once launched . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it actually doesn &apos;t have much use for it . you can also use a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something you want to do with the serial port .
the kernel is searching for different positions following the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can t@@ oss a look into the second column , and probably determine that the default run@@ level 3 is possible . if you want to change it , then you can carry out / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand , then you can fix it if you restart the system and run the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stops in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : every scrip@@ ting is written so that it is an argument such as start and stop accepted . you can actually run this scripts by hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ pd server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes , the script will be called stop by the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server Run@@ level , which lets you run only htt@@ pd , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of availability to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stopping ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ lev@@ els or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . this is only done by its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they pull out an entry from the field of dispos@@ ition services .
note : entries will be postpon@@ ed if you prefer to copy them into a new run@@ level . to select them only to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu , and even if the same entry exists previously in the target range of action .
the sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the Recy@@ cle Bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 Start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of upper or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry into manually , press the tab button to change the properties dialog by typ@@ ing the button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes .
due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . def@@ aults to the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) , if they are available . otherwise , they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the prefer@@ ences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve been experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ lev@@ eling , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ?
in the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you are using &amp; SuSE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution .
the type , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary single programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ pd ) simply quit if their configuration files are not present or wrong .
the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ;
after you made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or the entry store in the File Menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , user and user links . to edit , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the user or group features .
some cards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you are able to make sure maps ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , it will appear on which you can make individual settings , if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the map for passwords appears if shadow passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card box appears only if it is activated and initi@@ alized ( visible at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for any user parameters , and the plac@@ ements are given in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
the card groups provides information about the group @-@ related user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ur Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting these in the big field .
the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , check this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select the user or group menu or click the matching Add button of tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue .
with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager , remove and change the boot password , add the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , add the default operating system to change , change , change , change , change and more .
