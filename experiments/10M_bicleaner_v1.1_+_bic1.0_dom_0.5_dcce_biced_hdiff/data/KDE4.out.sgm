<seg id="1">You can find the module website in & Konqueror; -menu under extras. select from the list of output and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated by the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case of nonsense. therefore, no important decisions should be made, without checking the translation.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated on the internet. other texts should be translated directly to the Babelfish page, where you can insert text directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & conqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by using this lighter.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information about the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions you can find in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings Format. open the card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the kde package; add-ons. please note that there are more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & Conqueror. then, you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">You can also reach the module filter (also folder filter) in the & Konqueror; menu bar under extras. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current work directory to different kind of filtering.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & Konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM's root notes, for example: documental, all other nodes are subelements of this root noodal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & fsview; for & Konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & fsview; consists in the display of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is displayed graphically with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented in proportional to its size. this size must have the size of the size of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & fsview; reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of entries in it. according to this, & fsview can be easily identified as a graphic and interactive version of the & UNIX; command will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & fsview; is an entry in the Treemap representation represents a rectangle, which represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have the rectangles of useful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched on View color mode, can be either deep for slight detection of the disappearance or the picture of another file peculiar such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various features of the appropriate file or folder. for each feature, you can define if sufficient space is displayed or if the area of subordinate rectangle may be used (whereby therefore a change error by restrictions on the sign of the Treemap occur). in addition, you can set the relative positions of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of representation algorithms for Treemaps the rule should be observed that the area is not always adhered to the size of the entry, and this frame is not always available. note that less space is lost for the frame, if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to split the surface of an entry to the subordinate entries, the implementation remains to be left out. here it is possible to establish the surfaces so that the right corner are as square. the best methods in this respect are lines, columns or recursive second healing.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal display area for an entry on the menu entry. instead, an image sample is drawn into the area of the parent single, to indicate that this area is actually covered by an orderly entry.</seg>

<seg id="64">If you have & digious; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. simply specify a local, remote or remote directory. simply click on the folder icon folder to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you have to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folder as you would like to add. & digicame; you will also use as an Albenz library. settings digiKam set up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the uppermost folder, the images contains, as a base folder. & digiplug has changed as an album. no picture gets changed as an album. during the search of the folder you get a progress indicator as this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digious; dural recursive the library path in its whole depth. you can not exclude subfolders, unless it is in petrified folder. this you can insert an unusual & digious file. this you can insert a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenlist will not take pictures as symbols. this will then be used as an album icon. this will then be used as an album icon. more details can be found in the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up in & digious; you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras distinguish themselves through the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera will then be used as a disk drive. older cameras can be used as a disk transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digipah; used the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital cameras, which has a continuously increasing number of cameras supported by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional driver.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers the serial port slowly, this connection is now outdated. & digippled, this connection is supported by gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to be able to read the thumbnails of digiKam reliably. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not have any thumbnails or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digious; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plugins interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digious; the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>

<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can quickly be found on your location. if you have enough photos, then you will be using subfolder as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc., then you will print a folder for pictures that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements like versioning photos, archiving, working processes, constant supply of pictures to different themes and a great number of all. within 10 years, 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not reorganise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes the stacking handling easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are searching for an original or a guided picture.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend using the metadata in the settings page of metadata in & digial; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data can be written in the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently select the metadata from the database by clicking the corresponding point in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">"" "now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what you want to change?" "" "& digipouch has a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes." "" "these are of course the most important ones." ""</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts as you should now select any photo keywords, inscriptions and evaluation. of course, you can select all the pictures that you need the same attribute and then start the value. this makes sense, since you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now deal with keywords, keywords, as you are often called in other programs, or categories. all three synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogical images from another source with embedded jacks, then it will be done & digious; automatically build the tree to the right place. the modified keywords will be done on another spot. the changed keywords will be done by & digial; updated as it is followed by subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics show how different metadata changes. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth out of many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalogize your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to let most nize your photos just see you want them to share with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look closer it, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing, memories, the historical period is again present, you may even hear the silence. thus, your perception has changed completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For other who consider your photos the title is possibly more important than the picture itself. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is the meaning of the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is OK when a picture is not perfect when it has the strength only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digious; you can also use a lot of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8). if you export your images into web galleries, you can even tell you a spell checker. thus, you will have to tell you a spell checker for your wishes in writing and / or the title of Web-gallery.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different town without navigation system? was it not a boring planet from GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures, the train departs the spatial presentation now with a speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to exploit the geolocalization are already countless in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can also reap KML files with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures at the reception location. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice the copyright to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you what information about the setup page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization is used, it should not be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Autortitel (synonym for author (synonym for author): links to the author. examples of this field can be the title of the photographer, freelance photographer, or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author field, this must be completed.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (Synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who is offering the photo. if the photographer has been listed here, you can't need the picture to others. if the picture is a warehouse photo, here the group / agency will offer the picture here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although this is no protection against abuse. this is a little bit more than basic knowledge of this problem. for individuals, this is only very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-pros this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; this module will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record failure, turnout, current failure, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of storage media, recovery, redundancy, desolance, life time, temperature, data size, widespread superstition</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. this type of losses are the same you can pass through traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section, there are problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Roll Ontrack, the world's largest conversion company, has some interesting statistics which reasons a data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs you must be treated this cautious and you may not have more than a few years. of course you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality which claim longer, harder and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years for oneself. whether you believe it is in your messing game.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be readable, but you can use this risk in which you use good discos and good recording equipment and they are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write a lot of reliable. it's about the right to select.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very vulnerable to mistakes, even if you have just been written just for use. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and the control sums. despite this massive protector they are required by chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called IsoBuster that doesn't work miracles on CDs and Linux. it's also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to store the Formatwar against HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that is said to CDs and DVDs, of course, also applies to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recorder on high-quality media in a non-propriated format. please read the media with a description, date & author license and then to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing sters include a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a major field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: dismisc study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: discos stop on the longest when you are operated in temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. in case of lower temperature changes, the most common error code, SMART, can not determine that error. some of SMART confirmed the immediate failure. these are particularly readings and relocation. the expected life-time is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">These are only the complete losses due to overstress. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a blackout before you have secured the files, but these losses are normally caused without great problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't make up a lot, this can take heavy damage in devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these attacks can cause heavy damage, hardware conversion, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against power tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that contains a part of the energy consumption and it is usually available in the form of a plug-bar. however, remember that not every plug line also contains an overvoltage.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a specific minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protecting against lightening and protect the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of any cable can be used to your computer, you should also make sure that all peripherals can be connected to your system. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shoots, which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others provide connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are designed specifically for notebooks, and therefore also contain the protection for the modem. thus, you are ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage is protecting your system for smaller fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in a break-free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protection from overtensions, these devices can automatically make battery energy when a power failure happens. some models allow them even further to work until the current runs. if you have a UPS, you should be sure to fulfil the same quality requirements like an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Remember the potential risk, which is exposed to your computer system and compare its safety on avoidance of this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; it is only a small price difference if you think it is safe to keep your computer with it. finally, you should always remember to trash all cables before you enter the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost and dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost and dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions therefore only occur as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures. this is not a bad solution, but it is no general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are limited to photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for $25 per year you get unlimited memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">Data backup is very safe. transfer errors will be automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and with the large companies included in the offer is secure and a partially distributed memory. thus they are desasterous.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine. all transfers are prone to transfer error. the file system zfs and btrfs represent at least the data integrates between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disorders remain undiscovered until you have no protection in your computer. nobody seems to have thought about it. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are a further source of transfers, since they generate interferencing within the data streams. in normal file systems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transfers problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle turnout at lower level and is highly scalable. we can only hope that it is available soon for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English too.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms used and is also available for & Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data losses in the notebook and 46% in the job operating systems. for notebooks, the share of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most often think. it leads to lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to call the common file systems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the pre-trial process during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. if a file is not completely stored before the problem came up, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft and human mistake are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings away from fundamental physical limits. this means that the technology continues to develop a natural limit for these progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras operate in the direction of 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard disk will be responsible for 100 & euro today. so, if you do not have any other data loss. 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss. thus, backup your data frequently as the reinstallation of your operating system, replacing disks or size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you have daily your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, lightning beats if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget Aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally concern a whole room or complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, deserving is always a not local saving. bring your fuses up the stairs into the neighboring house, in your office or something like that.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic. if you have a backup, which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Secure backup: a complete backup of all files must be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential protection: a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differentiate.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files changed since the last backup. it creates several snapshots. you can reproduce the original status at any time at which one such fuse has been made. this backup comes with a delay system on the next one with the exception that it is only extrimmed and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only changed the difference of files that have been really changed. this happens compressed and if you want to enhance safety via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer to a DVD or another optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach enables you enough time to detect and restore loss. at the same time, you come to safeguard but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. at the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for every month. any additional dilution should be done manually, after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file, IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, resume images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewpoints,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year, that is about the interval of you really interested in you because they are interested in your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be respected:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider everything that is said today. unfortunately, there is no other way to let yourself be incompatible with caution. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easier it is the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document. use and switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available nowadays for everyone. if so, if you have an old system, it is important to read your images, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and secure technology, or change your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the reference to change a system in its size. this is actually increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's go out that you have put the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge to a dedicated record or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and move to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check the dmesg command, whether your new record has been detected by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDB, the new record is / dev / SDC & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the plate in MBB; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and ReiserFS and dollar; resili2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of ReiserFS if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day no software is able to read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format which disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard designed to replace GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, but not as many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needed and a slow compression has. this format we would like to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression salgm (deflate). however, there is a problem that this format has been adapted to many people. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open-image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. it is already available on the TIFF / EP format and is obligated for use of metadata. a handful of Cameroon is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also be used.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is allowed with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers move it before an original of your photo, mostly in the raw format, where it stores the metadata separately from the image file. therefore, it can be noted if you use DNG as container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization that supports a wide range of application for use and modelling work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI work groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connection and educational efforts to achieve a far reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. so long the images are on the camera, you can use it as a temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a finalized editing, you can use external programs. if you want to re-edit the pictures again with & digial; you should then add the metadata. these were cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for the copyright with a digital watermark. simply export it into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digial; you can find a description as you already have on your hard disk. but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Albendatdatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera and digiplug; you connect it to the computer, turn the camera on display mode and turn on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, you try to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a fertig -indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails will appear. if this is the case, the file name and a symbol of file access for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information to each entry. with the page bars and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that in some digital cameras don't have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturer's remark, GPS etc. of the picture. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digial; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button Download and then download the selection of all photos. this download the photos from their camera into one album in & digipon. in the download the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures will be downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all the photos, you can only select the desired selection methods of & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the button download and then read off. the button Ausgewählte is as long as you have chosen.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, one option is new available. these pictures were not yet marked by & digial. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the front window. if you select this option, only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you can download the buttons all or chosen, a dialog with which you can select the target album will appear in which the photos are stored, displayed in the section My albums, then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After choosing the target album, press OK, and & digiplug came; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete it from the camera. you can delete all at once by deleting the button. if you only want to delete the delete, you must first select it first and delete it from extinction.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there are no possibility to restore the photos from the camera, they will not be deleted if you want to delete the photos successfully in a & digial; you should carefully check it out from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera memory, you should make it easier to delete the camera memory, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are frequently used as a file name for the photos frequently. the filenames are often used again, after charging the photos from the camera. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made to integrate in the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for datestates. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the broadcast opens three more options which will be done before the photos are stored on the plate. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the EXIF information in the IPTC fields are copied. with the latest option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish another date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% d% H:% M:% S. turn the option to read date & time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera file name, you have the possibility to change the filename in lowercase letters. or in case letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digious; used for a photo, is displayed below the name displayed on the camera. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digious; can use all information about the orientation of the camera for time points of recording. not all cameras make this information ready. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo, read.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is normally switched on, and if your camera does not supply this information, you can turn off the original turn off. if you want to turn off the automatic turn off, use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the lower range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera has been made available on the date, where the photo was made available, it can be downloaded and downloaded by downloading. all photos with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras make this information available. in the section page bar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case, & plug came; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this option, you need to disable this option. use the button Advanced and select the option date-based underground at the bottom end of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your machine to your camera is button Download. select then uploading. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you ask & digious; you where the images are to be loaded up. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to launch the uploading. the images will not be deleted by your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this is a position which can be displayed in longitude and latitude and that can be displayed on a map. determination of the data can be performed by American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographs, it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to board an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgot later, where exactly the photo was done, you can send a postcard to another & digious; users who want to locate a postcard to document the site, or simply document this aspect, it is good to record the position data of a picture.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first, you know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, articulated and card referencing. the question is actually more than three ways to reach this. directly with the correct hardware, via a reproduction of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and last of manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a couple who together with GPS receivers work together. either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>

<seg id="297">With the PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to a high compression. this means a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files option, you can compress the deflate compression salt for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no effect on image quality as the deflate algorithm compile free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of lossless JPEG 2000 files you can freely save yourself. even if you have been writing the lossy settings, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG. as this paragraph, metadata was not yet supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digious; the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is developing a tool for manipulation on your photos. this dialog allows you to change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard imitate is that all green pixels are the same. if you use this option for ultraviolet light, this is a bit soft, eliminates this difference with minimal loss of details. this option shows a bit soft, eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the whitening is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white-off is not set. standard, it is a fixed colour balance that was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. the use of the second sensors have the effect that underexposed images in four steps will get more details into the top lights. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shlichter, so the parts of your images are being burned down, because of the inability of your camera to catch the Spitzlichter in the settings. lastly, you can relocate some unusual results because they are trying to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shlichens.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not so fast satiated like green and red. & dcrav therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question, how many color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the option, you get the option to set a level. this is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be customized to each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminanzee value according to your taste. you probably have to put it higher than the standard 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digial; -image processing can be done. in order to keep the time for the demosaicing, you should approach conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital picture process to calculate a complete picture from the partial image data that have many cameras and which is available to a matrix of color pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digious came; and Dcraw made you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG-Interpolation and AHD-Interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity) was the first algorithm created by Dcraw. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable outcome.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lentils you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color sofar as you are carried out during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions how these should be given back. there are also LCMS and & digipons; information such as the colour information of a color space in the other are to translate the colors as precisely as possible.</seg>

<seg id="314">Color profile file Setting here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / color / ICC or / home / .color / ICC, where you store all of your profiles. & digipouch; examine this folder then during the start.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "settings of ICC profiles you have the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profile. everything can be changed when opening the raw file." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">The colour management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures colourfully does not manage the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should be used to the camera vendor and model you are using. not all profiles are created on the same type. currently, dcraw Gamma is not fixed for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you must perform the tone mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the soft-Proof profile, which you can emulate, as your printer has to be given back as your photo as your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied, instead you can manually adjust to the flash algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's pretty obvious that color profile is intended for what is intended for. unfortunately, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon Profilextension allows the style to recognize: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for Portraitand S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image analysis and image editing; many modules support, which were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>

<seg id="337">& digious; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correction and improve. image processing can be launched by clicking on a preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selecting entry / Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digial; therefore, they are not part of your distribution. more information about the KIPI modules can be found in the image processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current filename, and the current image size is shown.</seg>
<seg id="340">One menu bar at the top edge and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image editing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you store File Save or Save from the tool bar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it with File Save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the picture, you can restore the original image by clicking on the File Station File. you will then lose any changes you have done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost any promotion of the image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can undo undo by using the Edit Feedback or restore Edit reproduce from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you often use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -z to return and Ctrl; -switch-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you remove the & LMB; for a moment longer press the back or restore button in the tool bar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started the image processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool bar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can select and zoom out in the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or entries in the box menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in tool bar: magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen Saver displays the photo in full screen mode. if you don't want to use the toolbar. if you don't like this, you can call this in the settings dialog by & digious; you can call this from the & digial dialog. you can call this from the & digial window. see the section for setting the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, select the image from the image and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or complete phrases. all image preview pages can be selected from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer assistent. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digious window has a sidebar at the right edge, the important information and actions for the selected images are available. the same sidebar is available without the navigation devices, even if one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple click on the same rider lets the sidebar disappear or disappear into the rim.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the labelling view, you can input labels with unlimited size or insert. note that the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed to be used in EXIF and IPTC- fields, so that you can use other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters. if you want to use the IPTC labels in other applications, you should notice these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you commented it, use either the button user or change to the next picture, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The section rating shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied to a single click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut. to rate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword will display a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this & digial; session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword rapidly. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another relief in the input of keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be placed by selecting the corresponding boxes in the tree. all tags of an image are stored in the keyword in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not to the whole selection, if you want a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword subsection below.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datas-, jigsaw and search filter from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull, drag and place them. if the keyword already exists, you can easily draw on the right side bar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is not reduced to three images. they were picked up with Strg + a and then a keyword from the right keyword will be put on the selection and put it off. a dialog asks if this keyword will be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off by settings.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and create and find that it should be a or be, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and control panel.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry which is sought in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key term, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can choose an extended search over all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look as follows:</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you insert a colorless workflow, which in fact have a colorable deviation from the actually photographic or scanned colors. with a colorless workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor need to print or the colors you print or on the web you publish from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes on color administration, everyone wants to know which buttons it must express. unfortunately, colour management meets you at any point of image processing workflows. in addition, we will provide you with lower information about color administration at any point of the image processing workflows. additionally, you should make links with lower information to make your own informed decisions so that you will receive the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your frame does not meet all the criteria listed below, you do not need to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated on sRGB colour space. (see further information below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture expenditures are by e-mail or the web, where sRGB de facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy, why should you then use another color space and do not have to make thoughts about color administers?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of limitation by sRGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see is the hufeisenical region, and the colors in the sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger colour space, so visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente page and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to install my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! if you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you need to install your monitor, because sRGB works on sRGB format, then you have to use your monitor on sRGB format, then you have to use your monitor on sRGB standard, a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool displays five automatic corrections which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting to move further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, identical, automating and contrast from the menu corrected automatic correction try to automatically test your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which seems best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the whole picture above the whole picture, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point as bright as possible. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Absame: this method adjusted the fluorescent factor of the color of the selected image so that the histogram of the intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes it's a very powerful surgery, which causes either wonder at a picture or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automate the same: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue channel. it identifies the dark and bright margins and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogrammrange.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminance of RGB values of an image by shift the lowest and highest values in between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-comparison of & digious; is a semi-automated tool to perform the white-like photos.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-correction correction is somewhat limited to be worked as a color space with 8-bit per color. if you can carry out too far from the original mode, in case you can perform the whitening in the raw mode, which in 16-bit mode can be used, so your possibilities are better to compensate for correction.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white abstainism of copyright protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start the menu entry colors white as the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The window window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand, the original image can be seen as well as the previewing of the tool. if you want to see the original whiteness, then it's enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red marker. the Luminanz of the Pixels under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right top, a histogram is displayed, as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small Luminanzines. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed. sum will be called Luminanz.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow of alignment makes you improve or dimming the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then put somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature of the white ink. on this way, the temperature and green values are automatically set.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pixel is exposed.. you will see the combined result in white. this is displayed in preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons save as and store doing exactly this. each setting of the white-mount you have set you can store in a text file and later reload.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Conferences tab sets all filter values back to their default value and the corresponding neutral white-balance. note that neutral settings will be shown another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the coefficients per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suitable for high-quality pictures. this coding requires also more turntable, computing time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog such as editing images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour tone mapping can be done by submitting color profiles. a detailed manual for use of color profiles can withdraw the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu below colors sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously, so that you can always use it for multiple photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always require the same error. in the manual on the sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problem is the tool for redation, that you will find below colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digious; tool colour effects makes you four colour effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and an edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, also called Sabatier, also called Sabatier, a effect of the image completed by the additional light. this had the effect that the light, darker areas protected by the second illumination. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls solar energy. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase creates a negative image that is not produced on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiety effect that makes a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth frame structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors with daylight and high contrast colors. but also some photo ographers, especially those who are barely visible from landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the results and the slide repetitions increases the thickness of the neonlight. in large images the filter can trigger the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras frequently have problems with lighting conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color constraints and the luminance of your photos with the tools in the menu. all your alignment you can be satisfied in the menu. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you have a photo at bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a good choice for brightness / saturation instead of increasing her. all changes you can perform in previewing. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple lampshade / contrast / gamma is the tool sound correction to improve exposure. even if the dialog to this tool seems very complicated, you will only need the area of the slide. more concrete the three firs below the HistoProgram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs three sliding times are clicked and the left side will be shifted to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the controls, and ensure that the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand the original and preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left hand are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted, if the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y-axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic setting is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knob: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, commonly called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the inputs, medium and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic calibration.</seg>
<seg id="426">Evaluation: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls which can be used to modify the output values as for example, a remote picture can be used as background, while something else can be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values in the filesystem can be saved and later reloaded, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pettes, the input values will be adjusted automatically for all shade, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the HistoProgram for Rot-, Green, Blue and Luminanzkanäle.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overload indikator controls all colour channels to view over-exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you will only see the effect only in previewing and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of adjustment of the inputs applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed from the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, two symbols are to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for pictures which have been recorded with a digital camera, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a course section to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones are darker and the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos, a red marking is shown. if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change, it will be a suitable line on this line and move it up and move it up until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: you can do exactly this with these buttons. each curve you can have created can be saved in the filesystem and loaded later. the file format is the Gimp spa format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you create this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the curve points for all channels of the shadow, medium and sun tones. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, Blue and Luminanzcurve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload indikator controls all colour channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, that means you will only see the effect only in previewing and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white picture which was corrected in the Luminanzkanal. shadow and sun tones was placed with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image (2) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">"" "the" "" "channel mixer" "" "mixer; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour shady images." ""</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colours of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with the own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the histogram appears to display the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to change these channels as well. if you can also activate Luminanz, since the channel mixer is used to generate powerful black-white converter of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes visible in the same place in the colour canal which looks different in each channel. if this is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you can reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender settings can then save and then download it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overload indikator controls all colour channels to view over-exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you will only see the effect only in previewing and it's no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been adjusted. the option Luminanz is activated. the original image is under (1) and the revised picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a working step, as colour images can be easily converted on the machine. also with a set of film roller profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all the scenes and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (TM) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange-filtered: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange line filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. thus similar to the 002 Cokin (TM) Oranfiltered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar effects on the day time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (TM) Rotunda.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (TM) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and medium tones as he adds a little cold in the shadow zones. this is very similar to the process of failure of a pressure and re-development in a septa. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thereby similar to the 005 Cokin (TM) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digious; tool texture apply you to apply decorative textures on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or as a mural image on a wall. the menu image is applied to the image processing can be used.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensional texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the picture below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2). the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">To keep the eye of an observer in the limits of a photos is no easy task. one way to keep his attention is to place a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the streak eye. under picture frame, the module can be started out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired cream type for your image. pierce the picture with a thin line and a broad frame (ideal for black and white images), it surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal for a button effect and decoratively adds a frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target screen will be bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio will have. this is important for the printing of the images, especially if you have used the tool with aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert an easy-format text into a picture at any point. this also goes to several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply specify the text and place it with your mouse. if you need to adjust text size, orientation, color from the color space and character set with its features as you need. you simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">"" "each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click on the button" "" "OK" "". "after the picture is stored once the text is part of the picture. it cannot be changed anymore." ""</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digious; tool templates can apply a template to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The template image template uses in the image processing can be used to lay templates via a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there is no limitations regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to add the PNG file format and to add a maximum compression (9) to add a file size of the template, please send an e-mail to the & digious; mailinglist digiplug-user @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for first time, you need to put your stencil folder in the dialog box. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be shown for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder is set for the templates, a tree view appears to reflect the folder structure of stencil printer. the selection of a folder is updated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button shrinks the image below. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to shrink the picture accordingly. check the picture accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move this button to postpone the image below the template. take the image and lay it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted automatically to the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digious came; introduces three different tools to sharpened. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and simple, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpness mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. they can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocussing is possibly the best of the three as he really improves the sharpness. it is a little complicated in its application and has various parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalised images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colours are combined with only minimal differences to a color. this in turn shows that sharp edges can be printed on paper. SLR cameras are normally more imitable than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures, a camera has often been applied to internal sharpness. images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners contact a hot filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you will receive control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness of sharpening. you can call it with the menu entry sharply.</seg>
<seg id="487">But you should cope with careful because the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise of an image the tool. you can easily focus on the menu entry. under Refocus, you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for hot.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to adjust the image a bit soft. use the tool to fix it with the menu entry and experiment a bit with settings. the screen window on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is very sharp, a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview can help editing the image, showing the display of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values frequently produce good results and should be tried out first. if you make the insharpening mask too strong, noise and the impression of burring will produce close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius appears like many pixels on each side of a channel through the filters are affected. high-resolution images allow larger radii. they should be sharpened at best in their final resolution images.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the linked image that is added to the original. thereby the thickness of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break out of the maximum of RGB value and the difference amount. this way, it can be used for a channel of filters. this way, areas with a soft change is excluded between the sounds of sharpening and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, heels and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed picture (2). unsharp mascate was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digious; tool Refocus refocusses a picture through improvement of the sharpness. it used the copyrighted discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to reverse a picture too & quot; refocsierenquot; in which it is used to reverse the picture. it is used to use a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. refocus can usually get better results than unsharply massively. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular saw works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding result is also dependent on the source code which is far from the original quellpixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauß's Fitting is affected in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels. that causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should set 1 good results, but if your image should be very insharp, but should mind on Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0,99. a high value for the correlation is reduced by the sharpness effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Space filter: an increase in the space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values above 0,1 is likely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will increase the image further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'S archipelago. in most cases you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you might also have to increase the correlation and / or the space filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. however, an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular hot or the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameters you have set will be saved for later and then can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity tunnels on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations made not immediately visible, but left uncomfortable artifacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the uncompressed image to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally unsharp masking produces better results as hot. this could be caused by causing unsharp masking a larger neighborhood as hot.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masquerade always have to produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never show the effect of the insharpened filter. practical, the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least just as good as the insharpening mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better with the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unclear color image has to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused results is attributable to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of the Archifectincture in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob of the set makes the imsharpening of the range of darkened to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink content makes a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tool to remove non-desired artefacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">This algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preference as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail-keeping p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of details. a small value leads to a smooth glass above the picture. for larger values, the value of 0.9 should ensure that no sharpness is necessary. please note that the detailed conservation should always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Guiding dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoother evenly throughout all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie grains or CCD rushing will produce a high-shaft pattern. JPEG artefacts are best removed with a value in the vicinity of 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of space in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is necessary, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect he needs to be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is gone. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle increments da [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen, it should also be small chosen, so that small angles should generate a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral stepper in pixels. you should avoid the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interaction: use more on quality that you get through the choice of this option is only low. however, it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store doing exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a long time and move a high CPU load. so you can break the calculation anytime with the button closure.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how imagery can be removed with small artifacts. the module will be applied on a photo that is made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you see, there is an intrinsic black artifact that has been caused by a poor film storage during the journey. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digial was a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read these in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen picture above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the lower window details and the advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is needed for the filter. large numbers increase the time that the filter is administered per pixel and can scale the image above the image and the color in it is smoother and therefore minor bug adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness distance to the edge of the filter. if it is increased, noise points will be removed, if you need to change the edges. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be obtained and rushing, or reproach.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. if it is too strong, the frequency response can be removed or smokers can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum when you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminous tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these attitudes do not affect the smoothing process controlled by details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Colour: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these attitudes do not affect the smoothing process controlled by details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gamemolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically harder to increase. however, it does not contaminate the shadow zones.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius is reacting when it is increased, rushing and phasenjitter will appear on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save below and load: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how smoking can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected (2). the noise reduction was used with standard settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution, painting a bit soft, is fortunately enough easier than a picture to sharpen and experiment with the deposit. the display window on the right side of the dialog box shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digipist; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefields.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter to restoring you gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of undesirable artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's sound grains, scratches, compartments and local mistakes in the image contours and thereby receives the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text conversion, which is done with another tool, the image error correction, performed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artefacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. it creates some compresses & quot; - small standards that are in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons save as and store doing exactly this. every adjustment of photo restoring can be loaded into a text file and later reloaded.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoring is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take very long and move a high CPU load. therefore, they can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how a photo with equalling noise is restored. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grains on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoring. this time, textures can be used to see an old color photo created with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that have been viewed by the Scannerlight and photopapier. the original image below (1) can be seen and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digious; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove Hotpixel of photos that were equipped with a CCD camera. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, protected by the copyright of Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem particularly with high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression may have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-image subtract method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button dark. the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to detect the dark picture right in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the right dark picture to the corrected image. note that the wizard will notice the last dark and recharges this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview can help you correct the result within the picture. the display window displays the output of the filter with current settings. bad pixels are highlighted in all types of action.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate this pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average Duration: it is an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all broken pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels which have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubisch: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim) or a group of Cuban curves in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel Correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, used. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digious; Vignetworkcorrection is a tool to correct the Vigneth, i.e., subbelated corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lens, especially those in the middle and large photo format, can often also illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. Teleobjective highlights also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it has also drawbacks. many Center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which should be impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lens should also be used, also with center-filters, an aperture of f / 16 or less, since otherwise unexpected effects are created by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure areas of today's film and color scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a centerfilter to simulate the effect of a centerfilter that is applied without this filter. the tool Vignettieri applies the transformation with a CenterFilter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators, you can control the Vignettieri-Filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light amplifiers at the point of the biggest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly to compensate a larger degree of Vignetscape, reducing it by a small degree of compensating.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leuchstarch, Contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the Vignetstat-correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls provide you only positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a fine adjustment of the target image, so let the values for light intensity / contrast / gamma is zero and use the gradation of the & digial; image processing from the menu color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetworkcorrection is applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the adjusted picture in the corners and (2) the corrected picture. a lampshade and contrasting correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digious is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses in photos. it uses an protected algorithm created by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colorless distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometric distortion of lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree of gravity has a similar round effect, flattens on the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth Grades corrects the distant corners to the second degree. if you combine these two geometric distortion almost eliminates.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second degree. with negative values, tonnical distortion is corrected and positive values are cushion-shaped distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the distortion. this value is more active in the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter is the reverse sign of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thus results in a correction first gradient. negative values increase while positive the picture smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrate the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are stored and the next start as default values are used.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be carried out before all cutting or size changes. best, do these correction as all first by. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a ton@-@ shaped correction would be the effect of apparent the falter.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool will display a vertical and horizontal support line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. in connection you can correct the audio / hoverted distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion-like distortion, the resulting image is black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu transformers from the image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most pictures the tonal correction is enough. the next logical step for some motives, such as pictures from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture are 90 degrees. note that if you keep the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction given to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (TM) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left hand side of the window you can select the range of previewing. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse, you can look at the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can adjust two parameters for film grains and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grains of a highly sensitive movie. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film grains and the dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in converting. green meadows will know how snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter ducts are mixing of infrared film, particularly the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos, as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film filter applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the worked picture under (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values generate a type of aura at the top.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digious; filter Filmkörnung is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is of classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grainy effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to be back into the past. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the knob the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated for control of intensity and granularity of basins. the default value is, although often higher values are required, in ISO-2400. if you need more basins, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film maker applied to a black / white picture. the original image is the (1) and the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digious came; filter oil paintings produces the appearance of an oil painting. it uses an copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digious came; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting. natural pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to affect this effect. the upper choose the brush size between one and five. thick brush are better suited for large images. smoothing the smoothness or, from the other side, the charness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editor is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digious; filter charcoal drawing uses colour and intensity gradient to produce a carbon dioxide. thus, images whose gradients are slowly changing, so it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to look for you. this would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a range of ranges from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator choose the pin size and the bottom adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon recording filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digious; filter engraving marks your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digious; filter engraving is a fast tool for giving your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure in which color is not the most important content of the content. the filter uses the differences between colour and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monious landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the working image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divides the image in cells and looks like if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wavelength 2: analogous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo in a work of art by accident effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: get off the image along sterning lines going out of a centre. this simulates a zooming camera and thereby produces a dynamic expression of the most often found in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radiale imsharpness: get the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the imsharper of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance Imsharpness: get the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion detector: get the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the sharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness: get the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreaming and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or for adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Schütte-sharpness: get the image by random shift of the pixels and simulates the imsharpening of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent Dissharks: finds the colour paddling in the picture and get caught without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: share the photo in rectangular cells and created it then, by colt with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The regentropes are a nice little tool to make regentropes to your picture. this gives it natural pictures a great look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn protected by copyright algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the drop. since the size of the image is not automatically growing with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drop. fish stocks change the optical effect of drop in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep using & digious; image processing a range free from regentropes. use the range of tools to keep the area, for example a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free from regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the regentroping filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the working picture (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. you can find the tools in the menu transformers turning and transformers.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo, with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrink is simple. the big question is, how can you zoom into a picture, how can you invent a picture? how can you retrieve or guess the missing information? how can you see the missing information again? how can you see the missing information here? how can you see it here a good job. try it and you'll see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose a change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size is using a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool for inflating.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many educational programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation for the increase of an image. & digious algorithm uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image aspect ratio will be retained when setting the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is necessary, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's Turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as and store are used exactly for this. each entry for photo is stored as a text file and be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast at what makes it, but it can still take a long time and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of the picture below by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (2). the preview (2) is the result of the linear magnification comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underrated tool to create a picture. the image processing allows you to create a picture with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and draw up the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photos will cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look like. you can pull the size of the square by clicking on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can simply pull it by using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the size, use the button button in toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl + + X). use the Save File Save file in the menu to save the newly designed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In foaming area you can change the size of the rectangle by shift the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog will remain.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool Following aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as high format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of height and in the cross-size width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After aspect ratio use a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you use centimetres, Inch or any other physical size. you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically centrate the selection automatically or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below for dialogue, you can set the Max. ratio button to access the size possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio saves its settings on the image-orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are stored as default values in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data are stored in the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of cohesitations allow help to hide your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonious divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third party, harmonic triangles are a possibility of rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden centre is a division leading to different natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf sheets of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we find as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting particle is 1: 1.618 the golden centre. a composition which follows this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides fluid relief lines if you compose a picture. these help become listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you to your goal good results for your photos. compared to the third party, the Golden Spirale can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the right side of the golden spiral, also called the golden right corner. it should be used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can be placed into the center of its composition. it can be a line or different objects. this can be simply there without the eye, it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles are also guided from the above-mentioned golden spiral. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equilateral triangles. diagonal to place these lines can place a static object of more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles in order to break your frame, create a effect of a professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your photo focussed on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition which you can not reach different.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal reflex and vertical can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of your lines to your current picture.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, then it is easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture where things are turned around an angle. you can fix this with the & digial. you can fix it with the & digial; image editing and the tool free rotation. select the transformers free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slide angle. the values on this slide are specified in degrees. by default, you can set the slide back to 0 degrees. a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help the module provides a horizontal and vertical line at your disposal. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you fix it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is the function transformers cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoother the image a bit after rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview will then be recomputed automatically. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New heights: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left at the top: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image will be somewhat contaminated. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two customizations generate twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After which you have adapted the perspective, you get unwanted triangular holes to the corners. one way to bersome it is the picture with transformers cutting off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The calibration tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the image will be distorted. with other words, a rectangle is transformed into a parallelogram. you can run this module over transformers.</seg>
<seg id="679">Make your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press on preferences, the angle is reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target range are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">At your help a vertical and horizontal line appears. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After completing the calibration, the image will be a bit withered. this effect is mostly negligible, but two notes created twice as much devastation and so you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shifting, the image has unnice triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate these is the picture with transformers cutting off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digious; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the type as these libraries are compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digial.</seg>
<seg id="684">Based on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on this site. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digious; displays only files in formats that knows. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list. you can change this list of file extensions & digipments. in the configuration configuration you can find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select it even the use format. a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digious; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the use of data compressor to digital images. this way redundant information is reduced to save the image data in an efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there is better, smoother results as JPEG in the same compression ratio. the 2000s can also store lossless if this is indicated in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw material format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF to the RohingConverter of & digial; you can find further information about the use of modules with & digious;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digious; supports the loading of raw images only with the program dcraw, which is included in & digial; all support cameras can be seen below the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a brief list of raw formats supported by & digious; supports:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. these clips are often saved in the avi- or MPEG-format. but you don't have any film editing program and it's not a film editing program and it's not available anymore. if you click on a movie file & digiplug; the & kde; settings for viewing movies use to start playing the program.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need for photo processing are included in & digial; contain their description here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpness, turnout, noise suppression, reflecting, imsharply mascate, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture. below you see & quot; texture Applicable quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture. on the left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumbnail. these modes are:</seg>

<seg id="726">The & kgraph viewer; project has set itself to the goal of replacing these programs by a modern and user-friendly graphics surface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraph viewer; shows graphs with all the options of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & Kate; and & Konqueror; (so that a change of graphs in & Kate; the graphs recomputed and in & kgraph viewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graphs in & Kate; opening or the graph in & kgraph viewer; opening in a & Kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems from around 1000 knots and one hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphviewer; is a & kde; program that requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for presentation of the graph. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own underwindow. in this case, the tool bar is empty, as in the lower screen photo. in this case, the tool bar contains just the icon file and the (empty) list of last open files. click on the first icon to view the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have one or more & dot; files chosen, the main window looks like in the lower screen photo:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & Alt; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the straight in & kgraph viewer; loaded file changed from another program, the following window will appear:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph will be reloaded or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphviewer; can also notice your decision as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up your choice later, you can set up the menu settings.</seg>

<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change them with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all the graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph will be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can choose if the parts of the graph will be placed on this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graph without headline and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The site again provides the option to specify behavior if a file is modified on the hard disk, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore the changes) or program the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The page open the option to specify the behaviour of & kgraph, if a graph is open outside of a current session. you can open a default behavior for this case (open the graphs in a new window or specify in a sub-window of the already current session) or determine that every time you are asked.</seg>

<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unfair graphics. it produces representations according to the spring-spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistic multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates an unfair-spring model layout for unfair graphics. it uses the Fruthman Reingold heuristics, and includes a surplus-redeemer for the treatment of large and groclustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the nodes circular, according to the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain charts of multiple cyclical structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog in which you can specify a Layout command, which is then executed by a shell. with such a layout command you can give & eg the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command you can give or modify the graphs; - algorithms also change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographic in the spherical coordinate system that is used by GPS and Galileo, which is used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in GPX format and gpsman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Picture Geographical localization Korrelator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the pictures you want to correlate in the main window and call up the menu. to download a possible correlation of time and localization, you have to load a backup file with GPX file. this file contains, of course, data that were taken at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded, an automatic correlation is performed, which displays the coordinates in red. GPS Spurdata are recorded in GMT-time and therefore needs to be converted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. put here your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. lies the deviation below are the data collected. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GPX file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all the pictures in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can put these boundaries here and then correlate the button.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos on the same place. as the dialog, the coordinates of a call to the next notice, you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the shown card and set it. if you have reached the relevant area and increase it again, you must always be selected manually. the map can always be changed manually. the card can be changed manually. the card can be changed manually.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exiftool uses to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums available as HTML pages and specify the parameters for HTML pages. the character set is encoded as UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four riders in which the settings can be customized to select. the tab is allowed to select all the albums you need to select by HTML. in the area, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albensis and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this rider is largely inexplicable for each image. if you then click on a picture, a new page is displayed in the picture. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default screen, & eg; Kuickshow, displayed.</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all of your related images. choose a folder with the name KIPIHTMLExport, which contains everything that will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images are also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. this also affects the file size. all other settings are explained by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="828">The rider thumbnails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user as far as the action is. press release to break the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically shut. you can therefore read the programming messages in order to display whether error occurred during the production process. the web browser will automatically start to display the preview of the gallery. press Close to lock the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI picture viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and do on them base operations such as speeds, zooming or shifts. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it was developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown as default in full screen mode. this can be changed in a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG-free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is it the file size is increasing since there is no compression of the color formations. this can be found at the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera tool is a tool that allows you to connect your machine with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera-client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata model, you can copy the image from one image to another. then, select the image file dialog with which you want to copy the image file, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. copy the data to which you have pressed the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a sachar.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG code module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packets MjpegTools and ImageMagick. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images will be scaled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the Diaschau. in addition, you can create a background color for the slide format. using this module, you can use the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the tool you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that are packed into the MPEG Diaschau. then you can launch the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The pictures selected from you are listed below image files in the portfolio. you can also change the image and content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adapt the other settings. if you are planning to select the file from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most probably the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should indicate the time in seconds. the speed of the image file is defined below. a low value produces very sudden, a high however very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set to be set next. in doubt you should set them black. specify the name and path of the generated file. if you specify the name of the MPEG-output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, then you can start the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer, you can then go to the production of your computer. depending on the speed of your computer you can then drink a coffee or in all the rest of your computer, if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that Kodierer or tools are missing, then you can adapt the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages on the knob settings.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistent allows you to print several pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, to improve or print with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import your images stored in the RAW format in one of three formats, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original condition of Him is: expect from dcraw not that it generates the same results as the software from your comrade. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, choose the RAW file to be converted and run the module. the Raw image converter window appears then in mode for a single image. you can preview the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the converter process. the first option decides to adjust the camera values for the white. if the result is not optimal, you can process the picture below.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use counter information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and the file name is equal and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you want to process your pictures often or otherwise, you should not select the JPEG format, as it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, metadata is stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF data.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start running button. if you want to break this process again, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacking mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to automatically overwrite the file. this is helpful if this is not available in a previous attempt. a preview of progress is not available, but the progress bar is progressed to how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of any album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and timestamp of the uses.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can make the image smaller or enlarge. there are four types of image change available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. width or height of the image will be automatically chosen depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adapt to your image format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the camera pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of photopapiers. the target image, including background size, edge size and background colour, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module, you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the sending images before. more images can be shown on the list of images to be sent and put there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images displayed by you. you can add more images to the right image with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the pictures of the images to add.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the knob images you will remove the selected images from the list of the images shown.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images you can open with the button OK the new message window to your e-mail clients. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. you have to add the pictures selected as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not take care of too many images at once. most email accounts have limitations for the size of the e-mails. it might be a good idea to send more e-mails when you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and every time used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you have to specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>

<seg id="881">After the selection of comments in a attached file, the comments will be added to the images into a text file and added to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu image file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it's best adapted to the lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore have PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and files the original files in JPEG format, then the original Exifdata will be added to the images displayed.</seg>

<seg id="885">After starting the module advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have shown your Diaschau. you can choose between the chosen and all pictures of the album here.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions with OpenGL. however, you have to own a corresponding graph card because otherwise the slides will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file names indicate that the filename of the images in the left lower corner will be displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop loop ensures that the presentation is displayed in a terminal loop. you can then cancel it manually with Esc; abort.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option will randomly select that the pictures are displayed in a random order. so it will not be used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Taking a delay between the images can be set at the time interval between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds match 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should be out before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can choose. randomly selects a different effect when moving between pictures.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Diaschau you can access a toolbar at the upper left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn off.</seg>

<seg id="900">When you press the mouse to the entry, the browser's view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand pictures to some individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images of your sphere.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture every person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can store with & kphotoalbum; but for each person you can store your own thumbnail, that is, of course, also for places, keywords and other categories that you have defined for yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the name, select the button that you want to select the right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately (if you have no appropriate pictures for your keywords).</seg>

<seg id="908">With the options below the bottom part of the window you can browse all the pictures after certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are depicted here.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but prefer to try out features, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and look at the quick access, screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Get & kphotoalbum; and select in the first dialog the demo, if you launch & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry with photoalbum; you can then download some sample images and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try out.</seg>

<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The time line can display several different time units. each bar then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bars only 10-minute-sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The time line can be used on the following ways: you can change the displayed viewing view from the database (if you select a date, you will always display the current picture of this date in preview-files) and also displays the current date of the currently displayed images, if you navigate in preview View.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the line bar, so the time information is displayed. if you select a range, you will only see pictures of this period. you can break the selection by clicking a bar bar on the bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphoto album; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user interface you can create in & kphotoalbum; built in & kphotoalbum; built in & kphotoalbum, which you can call on the HTML menu...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the transverse and description, which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created on the review page. see information about export files you will find in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Lastly, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML page. for example, you can avoid that information is displayed without description. for example, you may not use any pictures of a party. currently, you can't use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewing.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most of the settings are unique, which is why not specifically received.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. therefore, those you have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images can download, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so, it can browse your pictures with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, place the various folders and the URL to where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you have to select the root folder, in which all your pictures will be saved. this folder will be saved and select for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a KDE supporting protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these are really visible to the viewer. if you have created for the base folder a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL you should set here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the files created by you are not yet in the final target folder, you need to manually copy it manually. so the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final target of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the basic folders in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The just described settings are related to all three to basic folders or URLs. in this, a subfolder is created, its name you can choose in output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are looking forward to a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; you may need to add a HTML page to view images, admission, etc., then you must enter with & kphoto album; this work is not yet to do.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. you can import another in your database. the images are used with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in the file, whether the images are stored in the file or if you only have a link to the file, that you can have all the pictures into the file so regardless of the file. the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kim file either directly from the menu file... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will create an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two times. first, the images that have entered in the folder of .kim file are not found, so the images of the URL you have indicated in creating the HTML files. this is, of course, only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML exports.</seg>
<seg id="936">"" "in the following, the dialog for Export images is described, which you can call on the File Properties menu..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it is to act on internal or external .kim files. the following three selection options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">To copy the Manuell option near the .kim file you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the option Automatic to copy the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is normally not to compress the files. if you want to compress this, simply select the config file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is limit maximum image size. if you send your friends image, you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .kim file would not be very large. here you can limit the size by telling example that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the Menu file import... select & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The Wizard to import consists of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "it can be that you are the" "" "Personnel" "" "category (if you are a Dane) while this category is called in your database. this is why you should be imported in the third dialog window which should be imported into the file in the third dialog window and which categories will match these in your database." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can see the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and watch images: if you look at pictures you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will find the different steps from (1) fixed the information on your pictures, via (2) to pass through and through (3) Advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program for managing your pictures. but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about images, but often it also closes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; saves all of its information in the file index.xml in the top folder of their images. this is a simple XML file that you can copy on a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want to secure a disk or revisions in CVS.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphoto album; remembers the folder, in which your pictures are stored and used this at future start. if you want to read another folder with images, you can start & kphotoalbum; using the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">On the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window, with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user guide you will explain the various setup options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different icons with which you can visit the viewer's preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call through a button to the F1 key and click on the option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can define for every image different properties, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to process already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the dialog box options, you can set up complete membership groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a center like in explaining.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view, you can find the setup options available to you to establish the membership groups. with the above selection list you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, you will find a list of the current category and in the right one list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphoto album; share his modulation system with other graphics applications, such as digiplug and Gwenview. this module is called KIPI and means & kde; image plugin interface. see information on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules module. the modules can be described and are not described in this manual as they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most modules have a help page which you can use about the modules yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of multiple applications can be used together, it can always test the modules with & kphotoalbum; you should always test new modules with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu. do not say, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that are using modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not work. this is the disadvantage if you share functions with various applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications are simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this type of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which matches the current view, so show all the images that show you the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album & kphoto album; the modules also have a list of albums. here you get & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; 's browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have set in the Settings dialog as category for virtual albums, for example, if you are using the category individuals, so do & kphotoalbum; so if you have chosen people to view and to share this module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select the modules that modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of the start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you can see the window and a tool bar. under the toolbar, you see the window that you have entered your picture database. in this section we will not show more information about your pictures. in the section we will now show you on this window, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main features of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture taken with notes, where the picture was taken on. you can set any image on either individually or for a bigger number of images. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is depicted and all pictures were included in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing how you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes when you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view lists three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; as you can always use them again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on the shifting of images within the list: if you are depicted for example a family celebration, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people may be depicted, so that the names are moved upwards, the people will find faster and assigned.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see a alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon to sort by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have chosen comments for each image individually, you may still edit all selected images and add these images with notes. simply click on the front and back buttons that are below preview of the picture right above.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have several pictures, e.g. with the same person, it may be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, California, are all available in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles lie in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window which shows the USA as a transgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or Subcategory. in addition, you can also make an entry to a category or to make this entry into a Subcategory this entry. attention, this requires you to sort your categories alphabetically. see also this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by moving the strip that make the surface of the frame, click and move. you can also make your own window by drag it outside the window.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the button options... which offers you the opportunity to save the current layout and the appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also leave a frame completely. if you want to see this window later again, use the button options... and then window a / fade. this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you can get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you do not have a filter. for example, you can download the size of the thumbnails, configure by simple after pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you miss a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you don't have a window with a picture viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the image preview. simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and delete in the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use the pictures anywhere, so you can record the pictures anywhere in the database. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all required images loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, where the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard disk. for example, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnails are available, so & kphotoalbum is available. however, you can also view these pictures with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and to copy them again. if so, you don't support trouble-to-insert your images, please purchase a bigger hard disk to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to keep a little more privacy you want to click on the pictures you want to see for other inaccessible and click the menu. alternatively, you can also see all the pictures you want to see your little sister, upcoming and choose the menu.</seg>
<seg id="990">So, you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of your little sister. if you want to put your laptop now on your little sister, simply select the pictures you want to get hidden. if you would like to show the pictures again, click on Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in your privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please remember that this picture protector is by no means very safe. for example, all images on the hard disk and to the other one can easily read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection can only be trusted, those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason why you have all your pictures with & kphoto album; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at some point. for this reason & kphoto album; for a picture _ and video review. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer you can see in. naturally, it shows the picture, but additional all the information you have about the picture, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the InfoBox is on the upper part of the picture you want to see, so you can easily configure and put it somewhere else. all these options are displayed on the viewer. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see, matching entries to this display. if you then click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all images of Anne Helene. as if you chose people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have invited several pictures in the viewer, you can switch between them and back, by using the keys picture high and down. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these functions are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as Diaschau. & kphotoalbum; invites you to press a new picture after a few seconds. how often it can be checked by pressing the Strg button and plus or Minus. then the slides will be stopped and stopped by using the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the viewer from & kphotoalbum; it is used to change full screen mode. in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch back to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can click into the picture and zoom out. with the mouse button you can unlock a rectangle in the middle of the picture. with the Minus button, you can zoom out again in the middle of the picture. it shows how a zoom rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not zoomt shown. with the mouse button sets the zooms so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixel image of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work on videos that come in and zoom out with the Plus- and Minustaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the rotating functions from the context menu, you can turn the picture. this does not work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you have a look at the image you can find a picture with a person whose name you'll have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to insert this name. however, you may proceed to mark only the image and look at further images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you are looking at one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to view images with traits, while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature in which you press the corresponding letter. in view, you see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, you can see in your browser. if you have always selected all the images you want to print, print or whatever you have selected, so you can easily copy all of you to copy the selected images to a CD, or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the thumbnail view. if you can view categories in Dre thumbnail, then you can add features to the pictures by simply press the letter for the characteristic after the picture has been selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you will allow you & kphotoalbum; paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The painted is not saved with the image, but in the database. on the way you can undo your mixture later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In, you can see a picture on the painted. to turn on the painting from & kphotoalbum; click on the image to finish off the context menu. simply click on the cross in the tool bar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you must work the application of the program & Povray; not complete but the documentation to & Povray; you should absolutely read and understand.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their qualities are displayed in the object properties and displayed the objects in the wire module.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object as all subobjects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool bar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several positions, the following drop-down menu will be inserted, so you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Delete either from the menu bar, or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene before.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have modified features, click Apply to adopt these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message is corrected using a bug description. then you can click the input errors or discard the changes with disrupting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -User Documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program has to be correctly installed. this version is written in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Renders icon in the tool bar or select the menu item scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; it determines the image size and the quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert many Render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon of The Render settings in toolbar or in the View View menu option... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each reender mode has a name. you can type any name, but it is a name that allows the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map size you can enter the width and height of the higher picture. if you only want to render an image of the picture, select the check box below and enter the image section for renders into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination-field quality, you can select the features that uses & Povray; for rendering. this is done by a very simple color and light model to create a model with complex diffuser reflection lighting. a detailed description of the Render properties can be found in the user guide to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture emerges with only one ray per pixel, different mistakes can occur. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or chair effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of this error. in general, pictures with this feature better look.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates & connects & Povray; more than one ray per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. adaptive because the super sampling is adaptive, non-recursive method; recursively because each pixel is constantly split and adaptive because the reversion depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray reviews a ray of pixels. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified parameters, then both pixels are calculated using a particular additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you calculate the depth value on 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (b 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixel, which can be followed individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of the rectision can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of noise for the ray process, called Jittering. when you turn Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for the quality of the renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light-flexion. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map card, you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent, if their beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window to display the & Povray; -console output. if & Povray is finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object reception of points to the grid menu in the context menu of the wire model views. you can adjust the button separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects like the ball, you can set the detailed press for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed information for advanced projections, all the wire model is used, all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you show wall displays a wall behind the objects, the wall will be displayed in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick ground, there will be a floor underneath the objects. the floor is shown in a box pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick cabling, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for the rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted. more precise information about the parameters can be found in section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window boards or create new window arrangements. in the section window regulations explain how to create and store windows.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: displays all existing window boards. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">"" "the list of new window boards displays all existing window boards. you can create a new arrangement with the button and delete a selected arrangement with the button." ""</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name displays all views for the chosen window order. new views can be added to the button and delete selected views on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with tabby card, you receive a flashcard view together with the previous view and suspended the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you would like to follow without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you can follow all steps in this guide, you should find the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a bullet on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should consider the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can use as a result only a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to the rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have everything installed faultless, take the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of toolbar. please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">These menus and symbols are often used frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. in order to follow this guide, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry edit. thus, you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular note that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the contents of the view object properties, in which the different parameters of the camera will find. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything at the basic settings of the camera, but note that the camera will change in the view control points, with which you can change the camera in view. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button user or the input button, change the wire model views and the object tree according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. for example, you might insert a quader (insert the body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a reversible method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and press the button user or the input button. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view also shows the level, even at the moment just as limited to the plane. when you render the scene, the level extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can see the entry for the bottom. in this case, you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case, you can only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose a bit of different materials at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog in which you can select as the object is to be inserted. please select the object in the object tree. you can see the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the Pigments only shows a matt black material, because you need to check the pigment for the pigment. please try to check the colors at any time with a click on preview. also, there are many possibilities now, but take the easiest way now.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see color on quader and ball, click on the button button and then call the preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is right now. if you render your image now with a click on the icon you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you need to insert two new attributes. then, in the color scheme you need to do two new attributes. then, select this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the property tree, select the colors in any time and change the colors in view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to execute the basic work of & kpovmodeler; you should already understand the ball. the ball is just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: 1 (do not forget the input button or the button user), so the ball will float above the ground since you have moved the floor to bottom a unit.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now gives a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matt black material. put a suitable material in the following step.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you chose the ball, you can now assign a material to you now. as already on the ground, enter the ball a pigment as colour:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on the pigment, select Settings and select the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can reach interesting effects if you take time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The Settings brightness effect and reflection results in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not at all selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what ways you & kpovmodeler; offering. hopefully you have learned so much you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you play a scene raytracer, the Renderer hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that explores scenes) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects will be reflected in the scene and how atmospheric effects like the mist. so the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you can also see nothing, the picture is simple black. obviously, every scene needs to be reacted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in default file dialog you can select a file that you have done with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you must enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Imagine the scene in the last stored version. all changes since the last store are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to select only if you haven't saved any stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry can only select if you have used Edit Backsets.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting up & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the look, the keyhole and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortlist. you can change or add new commands to this option for & kpovmodeler; -commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens up a dialog to set up the tool bars. you can add and remove the toolbar option for & kpovmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to apply rough surfaces without any bump on the surface individually model and without changing the geometric shape of the object.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump-map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this base body. these models will then be processed further to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel-base, by applying an image file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser. the application has a file browser, in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & ball show; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking the & LMBn; or the key return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can adjust whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images are open in full screen mode. if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is enabled, invites & ball show; already the next picture in the folder, while you still select the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture, and is particularly suitable for a slideshow.</seg>

<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command-line options of Qt and & kde. in addition, Amarok has some own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the modules are available and use kdialog for the user to run why a script does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Start of 'Korundum' Rescue Error error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings V3.4 is REQUIRED for this script.' 'dialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the Folders scripts / templates you can use a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions. they will quickly determine that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with amarok and manage Amarook. the easiest way is to use the command dcop; which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripts therefore allow the executing of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is used. this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively simple. here an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this reason, scripts will continuously monitor their standard input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weis the script to display the setup dialog. to store and store the setup data you need to worry each script itself. if a script is started, Amarok sets the workfolder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script might be played & zb; with DCOP functions more information about the new piece (e.g. the metadata or the track length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signals a change of volume. the new volume is an integrating between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomizuClicked: submenu itemTitle, contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a user-defined menu entry can be identified. to remove an entry on your own entry, you can use the dcop Amarok script dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok is finished, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SignTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to do, for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages which can be compressed using a webserver. such packages are basically normal Tar-Archive (.bz2), which allows users to recognize the archive clearly as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Advanced amarocscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages properly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can load it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page by & Amarok. for your entry on kde apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features, yet surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can easily draw music into the playlist instead of working through endless menus. maybe you can also find a quite certain title out of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists, but you can never decide which you would like to hear? then, the playlists will always be hard for you. and if your decision is still hard, select the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music based on certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers IFP and many generic USB devices. so many different audio systems can be used, so that YOU can listen to the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following folder of amarok sources to compile and install Amarok in the base folder:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automate used, you should not have any trouble when compiling, please report to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; just like most applications you can activate or disable some of the applications that you can activate or disable the configure point. this is a list of options available.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies have to be met so that they can be used. details can be found in the section system requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activating debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: if you activate this setting, use & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the storage location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Note that the playlist window will be visible, that the playlists will be switched off / off, in order to always keep the running piece in the visible window.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing to the context menu, change the context browser automatically, as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the section appearance, you can adjust & Amarok; s appearance is customised. the section is in three parts subsection.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can use the usage of various fonts in & Amarok. you can select fonts for the following range: playlists windows, player windows and context Browser. press on Select..., so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the selection of custom color scheme, you own the qual of choice and can define a color scheme. use the color selection for front and background colour.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Playback at the start caused that & Amarok; after the program start, the playback is automatically continued with the piece, with which it stopped at the last end.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The subwindow on-screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is displayed, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click on select... to select the font font for the OSD. the check box shadow causes that the text is shaded by the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Your own colours gives you the opportunity to adapt the OSD colors for writing and background. a click on the color panel will open the color selection. if suitcases are not activated, the default & kde are used; -colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be customized to your needs. below you will find a list of the available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen is intended for Xinerama users, so you can define on which screen of a multi-monitor environment will appear in the OSD screen.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The map audio output audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box. some drivers activate more adjustment in this map card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, select & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection with its name, check the check box next to its name. this section also includes checkbox for setting up as with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolder recursively: this causes that & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolder will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Changes to changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folder on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). moreover, an incremental search will be carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Playlists: causes that & Amarok; all found playlists added to your collection (.pls and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection data is used to select a database for the collection. drop down selector driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySQL. if MySQL is selected, further installation in the subwindow MySQL is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data you need to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The card pay.fm is directed to last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations on the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your load .fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Sending pieces and so the profile update: this setting allows it & Amarok;, the names of played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Similar interpreters recall: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list with similar interpreters to the each of the played pieces will be given. note: you do not need last.fm profile to use this function.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). more information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs so (including those contained in it, for example modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, such as kdelibs minimal compiled.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions like e.g. the OSD is presumed that your window manager will work the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. we try to assist Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will make an error in the Taglib library. you can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this file to delete the crash. afterwards, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Mostly this is because Taglib when reading the Meta-Infos from this file system. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is something sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok used are compiled with the same compiler version. if for example & Amarok, compiled with GCC 3.3.x, Taglib is compiled with GCC 3.3.x, then this leads to overthrow the meta-information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, then disable autom. turn off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the E-Mail will automatically appear in a crash). if it comes to a commonly occurring crash, and send us a good backtrace, the error is resolved.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many program write data as UTF-8 into meta-information, but this is not known as Unicode. the following Perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The File $argv [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($argv [0]); my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print 'Error during writing the tags of $argv [0]\" or $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this bug: amarocapp: icon Lookup error: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok is the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd 'which catamarokapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you may need to remove any collized Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amaral finds the right version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are some possibilities. most of the installation problems clarify the easiest by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also use the help with other users or for developers. use the Forum and IRC at irc.freenode.net in the Canal # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter there only if you find something about the correction of an error in amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; appears only an empty playlist. how do musical pieces get there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That is simple. use the file browser on the left side and open the folder you want. then drag the files into the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the start-up window is converted into the statistic window. you will find it under extras.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for the evaluation by the user while the points will be calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate each piece, in the playlist, the evaluation column must be displayed. click anywhere in the new application column, to specify the evaluation for a piece. you can also use the Shortcuts Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amaral is in the background.</seg>

<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; provides functions such as copyCD, format DVD and further functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createc CDProject () DCOPRef create.com () DCOPRef create.com () DCOPRef create.com () void copydvd () void copydvd () void burnCdimage () void burnCdimage (KURL url) void burndvdimage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you can create a project via the command line: DCOPRef (K3b, K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project via # dcop K3b K3b K3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the top listed K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bProjectInterface, which is only applicable on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, QString) void addl (KURL) void reameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString newName) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b K3b MeateFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1495">& kaudioists; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for the reading of & CD; files in WAV files on the hard disk) and from many codiers to code this WAV files (compile free compression). other encoders can still be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD are read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compresses in the MP3- or OGG format or other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, read out the & CD;, is used by & kaudiodes; cdparanoia is used. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggprebis (for MP3), ogged (for OGG) or other codiers are already available, it's not necessary to compile a bit yourself. but if for example, FLAC does not need to be used, the installation is also not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction of Kodierer, Audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word for copying protected audio CD; s: as already mentioned, uses & kaudioia; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not possible to handle any copy protection. if not, it is possible to bypass the mechanisms of coping protection. simply avoid buying the Copier audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the set-up only needs to be done (the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration has been found), after the daily use of a & CD. this leads (hopefully) to comprehension for the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert in many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">"" "" "" "can & CD: get information from the freeDB from the Internet or can completely work without a network, where everything is covered manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a brief list of the main window commands. on the page step for example you will find more information about how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the Register for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB will start the CDDB request according to the device from request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection must first be made to the Internet.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the tab card tab in the setup dalogue - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoder so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the standard. it's too aware that before the encoder is configured in the tab card tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected instead of a complete & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as protocols, piepsen) for programs (as read out the & CD;) to configure.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocks; with various cards (such as encoder, to set up the Encoders), you must go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes audio quality, coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorts' or 'Monkey' which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Today, MP3 and OGG files are the most common among the audio formats, such as MP3 and OGG files are the most common. OGG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bitrate the differences become less important, since both Kodierer will produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'nt so 'free, lame is still supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high up to very high sound quality (high bit rate), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special Auto stereo equipment. today - at the beginning of 2009 - support these devices only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency to most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo equipment with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR common Stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good genug for music by youngsters, portable devices and autostereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information, typed manually or by the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. they can be delivered / used with & kaudiodes; and the code name to create folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the Kodierer and these parameters. the manual or help to the code readers explain the switch for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the & CD; titles to the keyword (English: day) when MP3s with lame are encoded, the switch must be added by lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocks; the result looks like this: '... tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiods; parameters used to be needed (= button number in assistants):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which the information can download / enter the information instead of yourself in the machine. it's too aware that all other information is spoken instead of the computer: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm. of the Ueberaster) is not a lawyer. however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD. and besides, the information is not yet to be added to the music business. all the information can be added to the music by a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiounded; it is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freeDB can be used with another (counterfeit) address that is not used in the system. in this type of configuration, it does not seem to know the e-mail address for retrieving data from the server (but this can only know the programmer that has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiounded; for use of freeDB, the geographical position is to be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of mirrors for the online cancellation of & CD; information during the read of a & CD. alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates on the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What is the reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There is rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know it, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD. it's always the best choice to be installed from the right distribution at first, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For saving the released WAV files, the code can be chosen and used to select the desired file format. during the first opening, pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the Kodierers tab. other code can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for the predefined code. more information about Kodierer are in Chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After the installation of a Kodierers you can get more information about its switch through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console; sole) must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This may have many causes. check the device number of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to put both programs with a command line in a terminal. that might be a reference to what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with one step for example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the entire manual, everything understood, but are somehow still unsafe to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas which make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, all set up and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 jigs (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as precompiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it can be found as a non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory contains and that you have write permission (eg; by copying them with the queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic set of & kaudiounded;, something that is probably done only once, and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read out a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each pending & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the used coefficiant for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program using to use the freeDB file to download the & CD; data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"" "although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it with any read of a & CD. if once the matching settings are found." ""</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device number is handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">/ dev / cdrom can be specified a symbolic link to the real device name of your disk. if this is not working or if more than a & CD / DVD drive is available, a look at the file / etc / fstick and an attempt with the available entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The map General Settings. there's no much to do here. here you can define an additional conversion. in our example everything will be so bellow / input as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only In case of incomplete information, select so that you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and leave the & CD; data will automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the calculator must be connected while reading the & CD; it can be connected to the Internet to access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filename or tag entries, they can easily be changed with Konqueror- &gt; umame and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, if you want to manually enter the selection box and freeDB mode, if you can use the database before you can use it twice as well. however, you can choose to use freeDB in Offline mode, at least the two selfs must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freeDB for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freeDB server over the Internet. how do the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything as shown in screen photo.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we don't have downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet Server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org site and look at them following a mirror server in your vicinity. on this path, the load is distributed between the computers. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since however, many firewalls can bock the protocol 8880 as standard, there may be more fortunate with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit & CD data to the freeDB server. you should disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings of screen photo. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously exclusive pieces: sorry, is there a reason why more than one at the same time when only an existing drive? a parallel read and code? the author does not know it, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD: discard out of the last piece: cross this to the & CD; discard the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this link, the path / folders can be specified, in which the WAV files can be saved. if only space is available on another drive, the files will not be created in the private folder, if you don't want to do anything with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything you type as it is on screen photo. the command is a bit long, under circumstances something to be blinded to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as previously mentioned, the resulting bitrate is sufficient for very good quality stereo quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restriction of tags on version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of later change of the tags file.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in screen photo. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: when a DualCore or Quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is what we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocks; this configuration is used as default for any excerpts of a & CD. if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it is described as the process of reading the & CD. we will create MP3 files in the previous section, as we are convenient to pick up the music on the hard disk, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB is used. the process of this section is described in this section, must be repeated for any read & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD which is still not included in freeDB, screen shots are a bit different from the data for a & CD. therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually enter, instead of pick them out from the Internet. comments are applied to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' edition of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, then the & CD has to be set up in the drive that was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and its length should be listed in the window, as in screen photo. this only if the & CD can be identified as audio CD; it could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then search in the section questions and answers to the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully collected from the freeDB, all titles of the pieces are already filled in and in addition, the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key to your & CD; there will be a window embedded, and you can select the database entry, which your opinion is best suited to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the check box for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings) you can also manually trigger the selection of the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have local database, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen photo. the title of the piece in the first line of the" "" "Current title" "", "the rest of the data in the input field" "" "Album" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must not be entered in the input field 'actuator' unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments by inidivell per piece, the comment field of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful withdrawal of data from the freeDB file is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album names (e.g. if all words start with uppercase letters or not...), but also to see if there are any unwanted remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the comment area. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on the tab card settings; take a look at the tab card settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with whom you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all codiers or file formats. see in the aid to the Kodierer to obtain more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry, obviously with the style of the read-out CD; this example is not important since we do not transfer the & CD. for more information please go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are available under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD-editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have already recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way you have entered all titles of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window doesn't appear when you have downloaded the data from the freeDB file. it is already sorted into one of these categories of database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">"" "it is the third knob of toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed on the track list." ""</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-sign before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected can be read or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">"" "it has been started by clicking on the button" "" "Select" "" "button, this window appears to confirm. OK, then click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and trace something out." ""</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab to turn on the folder window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see if you are trying to work with a Kodierer, which you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>

<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 in the format MP3. thus reading out and coding in parallel. please note the status of status in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that is configurable is the result of parallel processes to read and coding. the machine used with a amd64 seems to have no problem at simultaneous spin and code (of course two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded, and a third order is encoded in the queue's queue. after the last piece is encoded, a small window will appear in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudioists; you need & kde; 3.x. / 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the Kodierer of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the knob and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song becomes too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows to change left and right of tempo. to get back the original speed, double click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: if a piece is played, a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry in the menu, thus breaks the space bar while no piece is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics expropriation and again others both. some pieces don't have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined that you need to manually set the Karaoke text, so you will have the ability to change this if you want to see the other way in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type in case you choose from the menu Settings menu items or song events. the same function also have the 1 and 2 buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these are the series after being played in. in this section, you can use the collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open first the collection manager. in this menu you will find the collection under the point organizing... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will include the same songs as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can adjust the collection manager each time.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the button. it appears in the file dialog, which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting of automation to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automation add to the collection, a piece is automatically added to the active collection (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection, it will be activated and emptied the temporary collection when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs can be played. if you select a row after the menu, select the songs in the sequence, the songs are played in the order as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the select list above the Karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump on a song, select the button next song, next song from the menu or press the arrow on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To skip a song back, select the button previous piece, the previous piece from the menu piece or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the delete collection and click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, it does not matter as they are not saved when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI map General-MIDI events translates into events that understand the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, which converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet when it is always a trumpet to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards GM -compatible (including AWE - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There is no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the requirements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. requires that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer devices that are not General-MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, as the patches of General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard. general use will look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equation is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all notes that this instrument will need to take on the sound with the number M (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds like a gun shot. to do this, you can wear the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (riflation), patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is located in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here, with the concept drum-patch of the patch is meant, with which every sound is a different percussioner instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the tone is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards do it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how notes are depicted on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as its presence. thus, you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keynote maps are mainly used to form tones at the Perkussions channel. check out as an example of the supplied kexmaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to convert some channels to others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the corresponding Keymap must be defined on the front in the file! if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkussions patch on the Perkussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio, in which ratio Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied. if so, an MIDI file will be converted with the value n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded it only. the value of 4096 will be used in the map file no decimal.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard, which is to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to an octave up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu in Settings, Point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The CanalView is a window with a whole row of Klaviaturen (one for every MIDI channel). on this occasion, see which sounds are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument, the button doesn't change green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to view the played sounds. view the View in the Settings menu: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the speed of a song. if so, for example, find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that has to be played like a music piece. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. this can result in the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file is needed about 50 KB, while an mp3 file you need a similar sound quality. in addition, you can also change the single instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agreed, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror; select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Check the collection of automation to the collection previously. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow keys on the left of Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo, click on the LCD panel.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (if I want to play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file) or I would like to play a file only in the & Konqueror; -window and the desired file in the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly, without adding them directly to a collection, switch to the collection of automation to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you want to play the first file. so, set up the setup of automation to collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to track also B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do it?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I see these songs or see the postcard, animated me to program further on & kmid.</seg>

<seg id="1710">It is possible to track the preferred links under the menu bookmark, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy. if you have an entry, his group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the attached record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it if & kmplayer; not running through the application itself. simply click on a name in the directory, and as next editing mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After modifying XML files, you must be selected from the menu with the playlist and select either the processing mode, or select a different category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the processing mode leave or select a different group without using the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some functions can only be switched on by modifying the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and loading can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change of [General Options] No intro = 0 if the option is not available, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer; will consider the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / cd / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at startup does not need to be short, it will automatically terminate by opening another source. this would end at the end-animation however disturbing, the user can end the application a second time.</seg>

<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / config / config / config / config / kmplayc. here is an example like a 'flash' using the swfdec mozilla module:</seg>

<seg id="1726">Therefore, a given backend for a certain Mime Type is taken (of course only if this was determined also), this must be done through manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / config / config / config / config / kmplayc. for example, phonon will restore all ogg files:</seg>

<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one). this is why the video forlinux expansion must be functional for the X server. for the XFree86 server, this must be included in the following configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>

<seg id="1789">DVI; is a number of file format (English D e V ice I nbsp). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers from the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output like printer, & PostScript; / PDF -transformers or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can be printed (in the viewer right).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar captures the conversion of DVI; file in other formats. as soon as the DVI; file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion can begin to open other formats by KnÃ ¶ PFE in toolbar.</seg>

<seg id="1797">The logging of the log file is the source code in the source code. in the editor you can see the log-in LaTeX error. the log file appears in the error, must be clicked on the error in log-up and & kile; jumps to the error in the error.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the button is clicked on the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template for the document. the default options are:</seg>

<seg id="1802">When creating a new document, a template by file New will replace some strings by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings Kile... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering the documentation class. typically it will be used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the assistants and the related commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps were completed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can choose the template's own template instead of the standard.</seg>

<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ of the {environment}, jump into the vicinity of the surroundings (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">In the typing of many merging environment commands, the most recent environment can be lost quickly. this order is the most recently settled environment, so that the shredded environment structure is not broken.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group there are a few important commands that match the editing environment.</seg>

<seg id="1938">In addition to the overview of your team, there is another advantage by recording members of the team: it can be created an event for informing the team manager if something specific happens. see in for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens. an example would be able to record the opening of the opening and closing of the project if a file is secured when a file is secured when it is added to the CVS, once it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">Events created, edited and deleted at the event's event configuration; F7 project project settings dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Notes must be specified. it may be selected either the note entry from the editor-context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a determination member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the entered nickname of the team member, should be given the corresponding domain or subproject name, as in the following examples below.</seg>

<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of new created or in other ways than with file opened open files (where the encoding of the file can be passed), but this attitude is being loaded from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not detected. this setting here will be downloaded from the same in the project properties, if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quill; created regularly backup copies, so that the document can be recovered during a blackout or crash when saving the file. this is not the same as saving the file. also for not stored documents, a backup is regularly generated according to the specified time.</seg>

<seg id="1968">Plugins can be managed here. plug-ins are part-uses of third parties, which can be reused by every node-enabled application, the most known & conqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to plugin if it does not lie on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information will be delivered to the plug-in, so it can open the current file, the related folder (path of current file) or the project folders.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "Only-Lesis" mode: check if the plugin is refusing the shop. only-reading-parts usually refuse the shop if this option is not chosen.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: is this enabled, then testet & quill; if the desired information is correct. select if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantum lus; from version 3.3, the troubleshooting has been completely newly developed. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been implemented, as well as the support for dbg debugger. instead of this, a debugger-in concept was implemented, which allows various implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only a plugin available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; added.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plugins in the project settings. with the Options on the debugger-Plugin box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger project is enabled, some additional elements appear in the & quistlus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all retaining points, with numbers of numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the issue is shown (as in HTML) of the debugger. appears normally in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the Debugger everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this promotion, the link to debugger, if necessary, produced, or divides the plug-in with to listen to debit claims when a project is opened by default, so that a debugger must not be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counter to debugging session wins the session. closes the connection to debugger or end the leaves according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to enter a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this requirement is displayed in the debugging output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables as well as the current line will continue. if this happens when the script is started, the script will start before a debit requirement starts, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script, without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens when a script has been given, the execution begins, as soon as a debit requirement is completed, the execution begins as soon as a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger brings the next statement in the script without going into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger brings the next statement in the script, when it is possible in functions and includes.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Points the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one, than would it not be the current ones.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the market languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. toolbars are handy, symbolic columns of image buttons (above the editing window) to insert the text and instructions in a document faster than a user ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), download or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details of converting.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are available, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. short, one & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags, as well as the layout and the content of the Featuresdialoges, which shows & the contents of the Featuresdialoges; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self-tool bars offer a quick paste of tags into a document without any risk of writing.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the & descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag files carry the name of the read-in language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares if they are necessary, or not. although not all necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible, so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. all about the possibilities and borders will be explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it may contain the definition of many tags, but it does not contain any type of tags, nothing else.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using & lt; attr &gt; one argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class type class. the name of the basic class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>

<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop methodology name within & quill. is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a cutting and a methodology name. the arguments given to the method can be empty or% for the last name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day that is grouped together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text within a dialog box. this tag can occur only once in a dialog (e.g. for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">There is the position and size of a field in dialogue. this day should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the defined tags. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; statement: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and have to be chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces don't affect & lt; sign up & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt; can be replaced, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialog above is in & quill; -window to start and check the TagXMLA window. another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the verification takes place when charging the TagXML files in & quainlus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP file will be described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is also quite simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD. this can be edited diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be prepared for a newly created & DTEP; it should be used to create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] version = use 1 for & quill; version & lt; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">A promotion can be set with Settings actions... to be created. click New Action for the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned CTRL. with clicking the user defined user interface, a shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current keyhole can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered in the detectable settings and with the execution of this promotion, this text will be inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful shareholder type. with the help of this promotion, external applications can be started or using external applications (or parts of document), which can change or use as input (or parts of the document), which are the Quick Start -dialog or the various See in... Actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% script.In this way: $KDEHOME / share / apps / fibroa / scripts in their path: $KDEHOME / share / apps / folders in their path: $PATH There are other special variable, which can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document it will be file: / from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantum number; only one instance runs when DCOP is attached to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above mentioned methods, a script can input from & quantum lus; at the default entry, you can specify what is to send to the default entry. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application may also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal edition, on the standard error message. it can be specified, which should be given to the default issue written by default:</seg>
<seg id="2038">When there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. in this case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar using the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom end of the window will start editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and if the day attributes has and you plan to plan your use, enable "Edit" Day "process if available, so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignorance! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we will replace it before we have trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & kmenu;, graphics further programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit: used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note, that the created symbol does not only help you to memorize what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is mostly interpreted as a symbol), or should at least be interpreted by a message to the user, clicking this symbol is a & lt; start in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done through the menu with Settings actions... (in & quaint;) and selection of the desired action. in addition to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder, in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the button button and continue to continue with other tags, as there are, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some usual & quantum lus; functions for toolbar or it should set this for a better overview of some separator in multiple groups. make sure the tool bar is selected for a better overview. make sure the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the Trenner (top left) for my toolbar. after choosing the element to be added to the tool bar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the tool bar to the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support grouping. someone who doesn't know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -knob the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new tool bar must be tested by delivering all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Back in the right folder. after new eXML does not exist, it will be stored in the right folder, but your toolbar (s) should be loaded in the right folder, so that your tool bar (s) will be loaded when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quill; for normal users the ability to add documentation for scripting language or formatting language, which you may like to like a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quaint; -Repository whether someone has already done for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. then you need to create the docrc file. then we need to let the docrc file to you, the second part we will treat you here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = pfad, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec2.2.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2html Sec2.1 = Sec2.2html Sec2.1 = Sec2.html Sec2 = De2.html Sec2 = tag2html day 2 = tag2html day 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see in the & PHP; documentation such a thing:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element Top Element = PHP 4.2 Select = Table of Contents, # Getting started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before getting started and Language Reference. this indicates that subfolder is in a tree with its own content. there is no known border for the chess players (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table is referenced directly to a file (and consistent at the upper end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't affect & lt; sign up & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantum lus; Resourcendateien will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the range of the docrc file, which is to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. for example, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array parameter should be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file-binding lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements which should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simple and save to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / apps / doc / doca / doc for local or global use. then, create a folder in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that this good and it value are shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g., which documentation has been used to use the & quistlus; -Repository for the use by the & quantum lus; but they will not be rich but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantum lus, you are not alone. it is possible to share resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners, or else to whom. in different places there is an email menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">"" "" "" "the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quainees can be downloaded and only available if our team needs them correctly and useful for the publication. to make a useful contribution, what is needed for a GPG / PGP key. this means that the source of resources is guaranteed for our team as well as for later users." ""</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you will be asked for their own GPG keys (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the case that you have multiple keys, you may have a look out. in the dialog of New resource you need to remain empty (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can also upload the DTD DTD package (DTEP) to upload tool bar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, explores & quantitative. in case of problems it warns and it can be canceled. if the integrity and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not created by & quistlus; but it can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files needed in the day format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started by the DTD Download and Convert a DTD menu. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that is to be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Objective name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantum lus; following conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantum lus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand and draw full use of & quill. this chapter attempts to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts, without their understanding & quistlus; little benefit crumble.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantum lus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quistlus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are for each of the & quantum bodies; use, available. by toolbars about actions is all that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to each in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be all of & CSS; -patterns up to toolbars especially for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which provides common usage of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantum lus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editorwindow, the building reviews, the maps with information and toolbars. please suggest in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the box on the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current documet matching entries, such as closing the current, other or all flashcards, jump or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the editing area to create another context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic machining steps (cutting / paste / paste), editing the file under the mouse cursor or opening the file if the string under the mouse cursor is called a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the upper end of the editor you will find the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is shown as default for which a set of toolbars will be shown. in the course of further expansion of & quaint; the tool bar are adapted to the new functions and thereby related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if they want to insert a simple day, for example & lt; in their document, click here. now you can insert the data for this just one day. should it be a day that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog of different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The series views (QIT;) allow it to navigate in the information to & quill; to navigate, to navigate and to pass through. in the presentation with boxes are available for files, project, sample parts, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation modules.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quill. this view shows all files in the project and allows the managing of files in the project using right click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading, or delete the files from the storage medium can be carried out using the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quill; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole web site & etc; There are all options open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on which connection they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are only available for the relevant user and templates in projects are only available in the project. more templates are available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information on the available scripts. the concept of the integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can retrieve the available information on a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on the element of an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right click of an element, a list of commands will open in terms of navigation and clearing of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among other buildings. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. this enables the content of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the full documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quistlus; by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited, edited and viewed as a project.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default & quistlus; two flashcards at the bottom end of the window, via the beneficial information can be reached: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This cardboard box shows information about each in Quantum a running script. so, for example, the DTD used to display the current document and all changes to DTD.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This cardboard box shows all mistakes in the markup of the current document. & quistlus; scripts that are executed are all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quistlus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the tool bar is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantum lus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantum lus; is the ability to send a toolbar via e-mail. & quaplus; send the tool bar as a compressed Tar Archive via & Kmail; and if they get a tool bar in an email, they can assure them and upload them as any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the location of & queting. for this, autoconf has a number of options that can be transferred to the configure script. to understand a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting & quill; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 folder contains. you should also make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH in front of their bin folder is. the same applies to & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantum lus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quainlus; was optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious and extendable market editor? well, this would make it an absolutely superb web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quill; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; it should be & quill; it should be suitable & IDE.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be kept that & quay; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; develop, in good use of free software, the idea of why someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; -scaffs not only this is possible, but allows users and developers, & quistlus; so as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantum lus; enables web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this enables automation almost every task. by the program Komsomuch, they can expand & quill. (more information can be found here). (more information can be found here).</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quantum; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quantum; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quantum; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program produced.</seg>

<seg id="2115">A quick release list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time when you open a file, which is not on it, whereby the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if they try to store selected file / text outside the local / project template, only a bug is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted to inserting from the clipboard there are special characters for & HTML; -Note, so they are displayed correctly and not understood by the browser as formatting assignment.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; description, which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s in first line to add & URL; s in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script error messages are available!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window. this is the window where you can see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">- and Switching on the problem reporters at the bottom edge of the & quantum number; the problem reporter is activated when you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbols left of the main window. this column allows you to place bookmarks using a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu with entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursors in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu, according to the filename of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens a existing project from the hard disk. & quistlus; projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presented a dialog to inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that might be there. this enables to copy video files to your project folders or a subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules (KIO Slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quandlus; the project manages. in chapter & quantum lus, you will find the details explaining the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Downloads a project tool bar. these are kept in Project You / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>

<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. deletes it not from the hard disk. if you haven't saved the tool bar, you will be asked if you want to do it.</seg>
<seg id="2136">So you can send her own tool bar to someone (perhaps to the & quistlus' team, so the tool bar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with toolbar as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you have made or someone else has made and convert to the & quantum number; own fault format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / prompt the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to renew, without the whole & DTEP; to renew it. if this global is not present and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the shop fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) tool bar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog when there is one. this entry is always available in menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or activates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this works only with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent insert means that & quill means: inserting by toolbar, if this day is contradictory to the rules this day.</seg>

<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using external use Tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. by some limitations in the KDE libraries can sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which is the display in & quaint; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open window. with selection of a paper the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches on the status bar at the bottom edge of the & quistlus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialogue affects any application that use the KHTML part, including the & Konqueror; -web browser.</seg>

<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled in the best from above, as after completing the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift; F7 project project features.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantum number; -Project file. by default it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the repository.</seg>

<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log will be used. depending on the remote computer's setting, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a common collection is used for various projects, this folder should rather be used instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder that will be saved in the toolbars for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a common collection is used for various projects, this folder should rather be used instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local file system into the project. you can select multiple files or whole folders.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you want to download and change static web content you want to change and change. if you want to change or modify scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Employees, if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, should be consulted. if a project is started anew on new, not rush.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of mandics.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in root folders. you can select the desired files through pluggks or, by removing the bunks, expulsion from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with the Project Properties Project Properties in Subframe Profile or with the Shift Shift; F7.</seg>

<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to above, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded during opening of the project. can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">For this you can select the desired debugger. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger-plugin can be set with the button options. in the error correction is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In subwindow profiles upload, high load profiles (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a tree view for each profile, by showing a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted, as well as a mailing list. see details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration you can switch the event actions and add these actions, change or delete these actions. event actions will be executed if a previous event happens, just like the sickle of a file. see in the details.</seg>

<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only a profile is present, the button will be blended to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will keep in the core memory and forget the program. this possibility is useful when common uploading of files is needed and the rather unsecure password on the record does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quistlus; many high load profiles are created and so the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio Slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. normally this must not be changed except the network administrator runs a service not on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time saving function or a risk. use it according to your discretion. the password will be saved on the plate, so that it can't be easily read, but everybody with programming skills can easily be seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbars. it can be loaded in a project many views, i.e. by simple exchange of view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the current files and toolbars.</seg>

<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if not a new document will be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area is always included in the documents. some examples are available in the pre-storage space under global templates. see for more information about templates.</seg>

<seg id="2207">You can choose the file tree or in the project files to create a folder right and secure site template to secure a name for the template and secure a name for the template, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented gateway. you can pre-insert header lines and footer or dynamically with & PHP; create, insert files or combine with them. in addition, some things can be kept very deep in projects using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the sub-window templates is based on the files specified in $KDEDIR / share / apps / apps / apps / apps / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates. each of these folders is equal to one of four types of containers, as described above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, click the Folder overview with the right mouse button on the folder and select in the context menu properties. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is blended as soon as eleventh attributes is abated.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and adapts for everything except the regular folders in the template list. if a regular folder wouldn't be enabled, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text box. if nothing appears, it's probably in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows preset or imprinted text for templates in this folder. this could be general header lines or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows to fit in a folder with special header lines / footers a whole presentation with the appropriate headlines / foot lines.</seg>

<seg id="2215">& quantum lus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source code Editor, which are accessible via the menu view. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; -Editor and the second share the Editorwindow in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and turn back to the source code in which the changes made to the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; it is still necessary to change the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>

<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; -Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quanta.... After choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization by one click or automatically. in general, the recommended dosage can be adjusted. in principle, the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computers and a large spanne for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so you can select the documentation of documentation to work with the VPL; editor is also called as soon as a new document with the VPL; editor is also called. it is used to change the source code:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information on the document itself, e.g. keywords for internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed. a click into the list enables the amendment of the Inhaltes, such as keywords on the column name and keyword keywort2 on the contents -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules using the list below the list or delete a change over the list. the editing of CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as in a text processing, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves as usual. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and can be deleted by typing RÜCKTASTE or distance caste.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags is made in the same way through the toolbars, such as in the source code editor, e.g. if an anchor day is not removed, e.g. if an anchor day is inserted with text, any other restrial anchor day must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some workplaces like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. you will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for the same. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributing many changes did, and at the same time, a further programmer had changed a lot of text changes in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by myself only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what changed within these lines. and there was no clues on the places where perhaps only the entry had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of more useful functions have been added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">If you want to quickly compare text, just copy it to the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">"" "" "" "a function which made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a complete file browser." ""</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge will be fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently in one piece of code and make changes in the original file. in this editor you can even edit the result. at the same time, you can even edit the result. the screen photo shows three source files at merge:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge complete folders. this screen photo shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and identify with the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, one can see at a glance at the Summary table in the column at the left side. (no trouble anymore when somebody changes the rear.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicate which file varies. red color means that both files are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, then you can make the tipping work easier by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 1 folder 2-diff3 Folder 1 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows the manual tipping of file names to select from the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file once again; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"" "above the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge folders. if you select a file, for B and C, a folder will then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders." ""</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merges are crossed, the input field is active and editing itself. however, it is not necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare an entire file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. in the opening dialog you don't have to select files, you can simply connect the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and insert them: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which idea is behind it? sometimes, one file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would need to download it in & kdiff3; and then compare it. now you can easily copy, paste and compare these relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can do nothing out & kdiff3; only drop out text in a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and discard text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the Info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional), let the mouse rest a while on line. then a small relief window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to letters A, B and C. a colour is blue, B the colour green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is recognized, one sees in the color, which file differs. if both files distinguish, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merge) good.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Left next to the text is the summary column. if differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. for some programming languages, the color is not so important, only the relevant changes to see. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line, separating the summary column, is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines. if the line breaks is enabled, the line to broken lines is scored.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparators) also has a info-line with the wording output:, the filename and [changes] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, Save is disabled!!! (use buttons at the lowest dissolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference is also a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking on the left mouse button in one of the windows, the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this group will be highlighted in the windows where the group is not visible.) This group will be highlighted in the color background color for the current area and a black beam appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through automatic merge or through manual editing no more line more in the group; then it is only a wildcard for the event that you can change your mind and maybe another source appears. this text appears neither in the final file, nor in a marker you may copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; summarizing; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. carefully check this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigates mainly with the image run and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are used in one of the windows, you can also use the arrow keys, side, at the beginning, at the end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-end can also be used by clicking on the vertical image bar.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the eye window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the inserting button, you can switch between insertion and overwritable mode. (default is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary column synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as already in the section merge and the editable installation window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The tool bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-down / Ctrl-picture off) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-below / Ctrl-Image Sewards) or to the next / previous conflict also conflict. therefore, between dissolved and unresolved conflicts can be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this option is activated, you will be automatically deleted, automatically overwrite to the clipboard. be careful with this option, because you could accidentally write the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Lines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors do not use a push-slide sign\, and Win32-based systems do not use cline function\\ r\. KDiff3 retains the line-up of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of the recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start. (menu Adjustment Ungen- &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a script with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences in italics are displayed. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be blastically displayed. on these systems the button will automatically display an odd colour.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the tab button is inserted into the appropriate number of spaces. otherwise, a tab card will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press entering or return, the entering the previous line is automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, every selection will automatically copy into the clipboard. manually copy the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the same move, & kdiff3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters may be ignored. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when assembling, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a truck indication of '\' at the end of a row, others will only store a row in advance '\'. if this option is activated, Wagenreversal signs can be visible, however, as a white sign must be disabled. during the merge, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '-') are ignored. however, the differences will still be displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively after some smaller differences, the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic reboot mode, this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed, before the next time conflict continues to jump.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if you require that the automatic selection of many files are less important when selecting the options, ignore or ignore the options for numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are treated in the chapter on scanning folders and merge. check for details below documentation for the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version exists, then the original version of the suffix is displayed. if already such a backup file with the suffix. original, it will be deleted without additional backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting the user interface language. changing this option does not concern the current running program. you need & kdiff3; this option is active in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because language is set globally through the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry. if one activates this option, the upper settings will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">"" "" "" "on the selection fields for the encoding appears a short note that the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has an informal character for you.)" ""</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this is how special characters handled and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which coding for saving can be used here.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not have to function with your codec. (for example, your files can only handle 16-bit ASCII, but the default command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the coding of the output commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch on this for changes in white characters in the text or review process. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences in a colorfully coded overclock column are displayed. however, you may only see the differences between two of three files; C, A & B; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; C; C will be displayed with the information required.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply use the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison window next to each other. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and use the file name of the last source file as the default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge file, then the name of the last used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be given first to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use this function for example, to remove disturbing parts or correct the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given to this external command (see above), then the output of the command is given (see above), then the output of the command is used. you can write your own preprocessor, which matches exactly your demands. every input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it yourself. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command to convert the input in capital letters: SED'S /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'in the replacement string.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to include automatically created strings (info: / cvs / Keyword Substitution). this is, therefore, a pre-process command for line-off is required. the\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\ _ BAR _ header\\\ _ BAR _ header\\\ _ BAR _ file\\\ _ BAR _ file\\\ _ BAR _ file\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ _ BAR _ Date\\\ '\\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\ '\\\'\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of a further processing command for Zeilenabequally suitable. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / g' Every sign between '[' and ']' is a match, and every hits will be replaced with nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might need to perform several objectives at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the equations from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / switch 'However, perl some details differently. where used\\ (and\\) needed, perl only needs (and) without the previous\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and to merge. further operations only change the data that the Zeilenabyss-Algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-off preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function, text changes or differences hidden, you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to process many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge complete folders using & kdiff3; complete folders.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and shows the simulated changes without having to do it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... guides selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is similar to the comparing and merge of single files. you only need to open folder on command line or dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged then folder 1 is used as base. if no target folders is specified, uses & kdiff3; Folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not merge the merge. to launch the merge, you must select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">During the reading of the folder, you will inform you a small message window on the current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files will be listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click here.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the + / - or click on the object, or by clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the directory contains two functions and open all subdirectories with which you can open up all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double click on a file, the file disk will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The column in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in other folders, then this is visible in the column A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action will not be chosen automatically. if the merge will start, you will be informed about any problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the columns A / B / C are used in the columns A / B / C colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when all its content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, the age is insignificant for its colour.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. colours reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green then yellow and later, when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copying A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A file and B file is): error: contradictory data types. as long as such faultless objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronizing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folders are given. then select & kdiff3; the required action, so after that both folders are identical. if used for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user looks as a visible file name for the output file only B; directly after executing & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and then select the option New File instead of merge (unsafe), then the date of files and proposes the newer file to copy. if the files are different, but the date is identical, but the date is identical.. Solange cannot be removed, the merge can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During the merge, a file is processed after the other. the status column shows Fertig when the merge has been successful, and according to other messages if something unexpected has been completed, you should make a last check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the setup dialog the file comparative method is selected, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unsolved, dissolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for solved conflicts is only indicated when three folders compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can select either the selected entry (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all of the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have no target folder, then it will be used in the three-file merge mode C as a target in the two-file merge will be chosen B as target and used for synchronizing A and / or B as target.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries are to be displayed in the folder. there are some options which might be skipped in the folder structure. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To summarize all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keynote). to execute just the current entry, select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the contradictory data types are still invalid, a message appears that points to incorrect elements. you can then select a valid promotion.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog window will appear with the options passing, simulate and breaking.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulations when you want to see what would happen without the really changes would happen. you will then receive an exhaustive list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screen photo).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select or press F7. if you have not saved or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. if you have the option to select a different action for the entry or resolve the problem in other ways before attempting to merge with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries are not recorded (in the current session) and will not be saved once again. even if the cooperating result has been recorded or not saved, these entries will be done as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be re-led again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory-merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that are displayed on the indicated pattern will be displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is not to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern will not appear in the element tree. it can be entered more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .original; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are also ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a verb attribute. in other file systems, a leading point is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">In links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files are compared to which the links display. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">In links to Folder: if the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folders will result in a file that would result in a junction (or diff3; crashes) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file through and displays the statistics columns. (the number dissolved, unnecessarily, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text. (enter an appropriate anti-sample).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large file via a slow network, it may be quicker to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed benefit is a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similarly to trust the change date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered as identical. this option can be useful for example when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activating the synchronizing mode if two folders are compared and no target folders are specified. in this mode, the proposals will be identical in both folders. this option is also stored in both folders. this option is set off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action. (this will be considered insecure because the other file is not changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is checked in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder will be replaced or deleted by another file, the original version will be renamed. if an old backup file is changed with the .original file, this will also affect the normal merge of individual files, not only the merge whole folder. this option is enabled in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge mode remains visible to the merge of individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want, you can turn off the main window in the window menu and switch the change between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double click. however, there is also an appropriate menu entry. you can also set up a single file directly, without being able to manage the file, and the file will not run again when you run the file.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: new directory: read new</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders, which are on local or remote computer.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with an FTP server. the second command line resembles a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has other syntax as local files and folders. a few things should please note:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relatively. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank draw &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file with the name / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes, due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a brief list of the limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, SFTP:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change date. hence, soak the permissions or change date from the original. (please refer to the option in the size of the size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the differences in KDevelop. KDevelop first starts to start the built-in differences. in order to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the differences and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a node. then, and kdiff3; the names of the original files in Unified format. then, and kdiff3; the names of the original files must exist. then, & kdiff3, the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if any of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since generation of patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3, as part is executed, it supports only the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merge or the same of folders is not supported in part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now heis Compare) is already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 is already pointing out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I use GPL programs very long and have learned a lot to look into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or going to go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably don't have the right prefix to KDE. in the preset, KDE installed in / usr / local but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are treated as identical; but if only a non-white character is treated as identical, the line is not treated as unidentical. iF-lines, next to each other, this is the vein OFTEN the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor tells you for any difference in the files where it starts and where he ends. this important information is simply lost when the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format which could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to process large amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is sudden, no src left; released and the text can not be extinguished. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; already use many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and lacks the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">Um & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir is the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automate used, you should not have any problems when compiling. should trouble occur, please report on the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Umbrel Remove) into the clipboard and deletes the selected text. add the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replace the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences: files identical in all folders does not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to update the folder to these options by updating the update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">Only entries are displayed, the differences are displayed. if the target folder does not contain these files in the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain these files, it is likely to change according to the merge file. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is checked in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with labels A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the outcome window (if the lines are already present), they will be removed accordingly when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. Understanding in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; shows a minipreview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the working areas to stop her size or move it. this works both inside a desktop and also several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in the applications. applications can be selected and even moving on desktop and other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on: if on the empty background of & kpager; click here, the context menu only has to set up the two entries in Pager; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as entries to minimise, maximize, on desktop and end.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. appears only when clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only when clicked on a application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is marked, windows can be moved inside & kpager; s with the middle mouse button on desktop and also to other work areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the & kpager is displayed; the names of the virtual working areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this rim makes the & kpager; displaying the numbers of virtual workspaces. is it together with name display, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & kpager; only the empty workspaces are displayed in order to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here is the view of the program window. simple directing with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard icon and pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined: classic lets & kpager; in a 2xn grid, all virtual workspaces are available in a horizontal row; horizontally, shows all virtual working areas in a vertical range, which is very good for the representation of the sides on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager miniature program in the Control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display the windows as symbols or by its content and it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & kpager; and then select setup from switch switches... lets dialog appear settings.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently it cannot be changed in the dialog settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or VI. If you don't have a write permission for the file, you must enter the key windowTransparent mode and assign it to this file. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can catch the content of the magnifying driver and move. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, press & Shift; press the & MMB button, you can move the drop down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the drop window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window is stuck and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>

<seg id="2500">To get it once again: even if & kmousetool; pain helps to get created when clicking with mouse, it is against pain that are caused by moving the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aids: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and introduces a mouse button as soon as you break the movement briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shift is enabled, makes & kmousetool; a break when it is done. move the mouse button before turning the mouse button. in this way, you can run pulling in an impressive mouse button. the smart dipping requires a little exercise, but you get used to get used quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This weighttime must be stored after the end of the mouse movement, before & kmousetool; a mouse click leads.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes shift is enabled, the time is set off (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting, before moving the mouse button, before turning the mouse button, if there is no indication of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking on the mouse button. this function is activated by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow way to the left and back is saved, when & kmousetool _ strokes.txt files are launched, but the first time has started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move on to shorten the reaction time. open the sound system and here the rider General. there is a slide sound buffer, which you can adjust to a lower value in order to reduce the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is checked, & kmousetool will start at any start of & kde; at the moment, this function is currently only under & kde; please note the respective documentation to rate to find out how to automatically start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Set all the settings on the values used when opening the dialog. have you already pushed the button user to reset the settings after the last push of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; initially with the preferences. in particular, smart shifts should be used at first. if you then click on the automatic mouse, you can later take the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should consciously make a mouse click without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window that does not display a link. you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse completes, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you can not just clean the mouse, but also the roles to get in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies from mouse to mouse. it should be clear, however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">"" "if you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or the fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system is interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you just have a shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool, means that operation no longer can end by the release of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is reset to the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and put the cursor to another spot.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor in place where you want to place it. if you don't want to adjust the mouse on a neutral area of desktop, if you are not able to cause the mouse cursor. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the grey areas around the toolbars and menus and the titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with smart shifts, but I don't create it to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent diversity is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes his time to copy it to copy, paste it into the clipboard, or do any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but there will probably be some advice to them. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use smart shifts, if you just start using & kmousetool; use text instead as follows: perform a mouse click here, while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and re-press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this makes every time when & kmousetool; the mouse button puts a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the smart shifts starts using it. however, you can also use intelligent diversity without the audible mouse click. however, it requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool; you have to install the XTest extension for & X windows; this should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and loudspeaker, and it is set correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; soften the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor is canceled. this program was designed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome, and those who prepare the massage of the brightest pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain amount of time that a pulling process begins, before the mouse is detached. in this way, it can also be carried out with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced skills of & ktops; for normal work with & ktops; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In Filters, text is edited before being sent to program speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to select incorrectly spoken words or abbreviations, or to select matching language and speakers, or to bypass certain defects of language synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working methods of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktops; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds those orders. if output of the Screen reader is read, the orders received will be continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings are the next priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved for hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders will be continued after the warning of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the nights of the top priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & kmouth; a long text can be read on a web site, you can easily enter the room. & kmouth; notifications are also news. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you want to print from the card card is a word order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the issue longer texts, which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the edition of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a Screen reader, while & ktops; just such a read, this edition will stop and end.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters can never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they will be applied to normal warnings, news and text orders as well as & kde; messages are applied.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter process the text and give it further to the next filter. at present there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are done as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. sending parts can be displayed either as words or as regular expressions. it will be made using text or as regular expressions as: -) by text or for formatting news from & conversation; or & Kmail; in a better understood form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in delivery of & ktops; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters, you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that have set the text to & ktops; if you have set up a female voice on the card, you can read the text by KDE messages about it. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a speech output. if the filter is determined that its rules can not apply, it remains the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktops; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters, which are placed on the side down. the processing by the filter is performed in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the furnished normal filter. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filter will be turned upwards downwards from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filtering, and it will display the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set a list of words or regular expressions, you need to input a list of words or regular expressions as comparison pattern. these patterns are exchanged in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the matching text. large and low-note case is not considered when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Type a name for your filter. you can choose this name freely, it must be distinguished only by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replace it in accordance with the string in the column heap. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save the current list or delete a list from a file, files are attached from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is registered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker for the word order is published here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages when clicking the mouse click the & Ctrl; button hold down.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only used if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can input several programs separately by commas. example: conversation, Kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">You can receive the program ID running programs with the program qdbus; the & DBus; -numbers have to leave you. if for example & qdbus, you can only enter the ID-ID-3432.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only apply to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words, the string recessed filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. the words must therefore be limited by dividing signs (space) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; regular expressions can be found in the package.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes brands for controlling the voice of voice, speech, and pitch. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktops; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the Rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, the festival used in the SSML output.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or tape in the festival configuration dialog does not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually very monotonous.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and propositional recognition filter (SDB filter). therefore, the first set must be synthesized, not the whole word order. thus, you can also stop or jump or break, even if the language synthesizers are not supported directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the Satzborderrecognisable filter. when the first start of & ktops are automatically set up. you can change its settings, or add further Satisfaction filter, but beginners will not be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn the setup selection through out. switch on the card selection and select text to read. please switch on the card selection, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then the first set can be processed, as only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long.</seg>
<seg id="2731">You will then keep text orders placed on the card card or cancel orders, even if the language synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set-limiter filter will automatically set up if you launch kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, you can't have anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Reference filter compare text with a regular expression of propositional and add a tabular sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabling signs are automatically removed from the filtering). note that the default of the standard lock filter maintains the character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages (cold), warnings, news or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you are removed from the normal satin-limiting filter, you can insert it again by load them in & ktops; standard _ sbdrc included.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection menu, you can overwrite the microphone settings for the application. the card card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard spokesman (the top on the card speaker). in other words, no microphone properties will be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable spokesman, which has all the properties of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktops; this speaker. otherwise, select & ktops; the speaker that is the most introduced properties.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to input the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the select buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Please select the properties of the desired speaker. if this feature does not play a role, don't give anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Check this check box if the property should have priority before other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output is, it is always used as a priority property. you will probably use this property. if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the message introduced in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To put all the properties in the area speaker that matches the following below, click on the select button, and then use speakers that matches the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last word order in the queue. you can also specify a copy number. (no order number is required to enter 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr falls immediately when it started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktops. probably you have to register GStreamer. at GStreamer 0.8.x, the command is not solved yet, it is possibly a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall gamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I stop playing music simultaneously with another application, freezes & ktops; a message on the & konose; appears a message that says: the Lato open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, the problem exists that conflicts at ALSA will occur, which prevent the simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. you can find information for possible solutions on the ALSA project website (dmix) under www.alsa-Cumt.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet. I installed it and can't use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktops int / voices add the new voice. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the & URL; where you have found your voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the map audio there is a setting speed. so that this works, the program SOx has to be installed and above the environment variable PATH will be able to provide a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored when & ktops; & HTML; (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML;) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; by & XML; (see) or if you're totally brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML conversion filter, and put the microphone speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't create your websites with a female voice. I set up a female festival speaker, but & ktops; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER doesn't seem to work. so that the XSL file rejects any error to convert SSML after Saber the GENDER tags. the same applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added my own strings filter and now I can go in & ktops; not anymore satin or going back. on the card, orders are displayed only from one proposition. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question marks, withdrawal signs, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to filter out a filter to the propositional detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; sound Architecture). ALSA is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-Cumt.org)</seg>

<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware doesn't have to install and configure any physical devices and their drivers need to be installed and configured, so & knetworkconf; the device is at all apparent and the setting of the network features enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for the network hardware and other devices are added to installing & Linux; with installed and set up. network devices later added, the drivers need to be loaded with the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network interface settings will be loaded when the option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; index is chosen. when starting the module network settings this is attempting to detect the platform on the system automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the spring selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and the release date can be hit permanently. by selecting the setting non-re-inquiries, setting the network settings will then be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system administrating mode. before, all options are displayed in the system administration mode. in the system administration mode, change is not possible. in the system administration mode, you will be able to adjust the button mode at the right bottom of the module. it is necessary to input the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system administration mode, the whole functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces is used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. from the tab network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">Setting up network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button interface and set up in the dialog device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Settings button to display the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the selection of Automatically the TCP / IP settings are produced by a DHCP Server or BOOTP Server. the DHCP- or BOOTP server automatically sends all the required TCP / IP information at any system start, therefore no further setting is required. in the list box, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the selection Manually without DHCP or BOOTP can be made the TCP / IP configuration. in the input field IP address, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask is determined.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initiates the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values given in this dialog are displayed as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address is not already used in the network. the input of an already existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & konose; you can determine whether the desired address is already used. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off if required. switching an output network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or off on demand. switch off a activated network device through selecting from the list and click interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networking and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other subjects.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If the computer is more than a network interface, the interface to the web is to be selected in which the gateway computer can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only be able to understand IP addresses. if the computer requires http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS solves this name into an IP address such as 123.45,678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for the naming resolution of this list resolution enables simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be arranged by selecting an application and execution or downgrading in the list using the buttons or downwards in the priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button add... from the group calculator to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Nameserver dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you have to set the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click Edit button.... It will display the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name designated computer describes the name-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily when booting, if no DNS server is available. in small, closed networks can replace it DNS server.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally contains the list well-known hosts some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses will support. this is still in the test version of IP is to replace in the future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known host and click Add to Add the New Testament dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known host and click the button. if the familiar computer has multiple alias name, de button will press several times and enter the other alias name.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a well-known hostname from the list and select Edit.... The dialog box will display.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can run one of the following tasks, then with clicking OK, the list of static hosts will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings provided in the module settings are not immediately available in the system. to activate the changes you need to set in a & konose; the following command must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkcon.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient when & kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is simply to download the rpm package and in one & konose; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with a graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient, but also the development packages are required for libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should be done.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given on basic network technology, in the second, all of & knetworkconf; changeable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been found great spread. IPv6 is expected to pass through it in the near future. this description is currently concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is attributable. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the contact address given to a valid IP address, or if available, DHCP can not be chosen arbitrarily. definitely, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When placing an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specially designed for this purpose. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses are usually used in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the range is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = its own machine). the default route is required for the IP transmission.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The netaddress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface that works as a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, the configuration files containing & knetworkconf; are affected and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed at DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL links a different content than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is well known that this file is modified by the scripts in SuSEconony. another stand can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a secure program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the ability to create multiple archives on a tape. the first target was to create a surface for tar, which provided the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective cutback. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife did: how much longer does it take?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be connected by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; trains the band back and read the prestressing of the band. recognize & kdat; the credits not on the band are asked if the band will be formatted.</seg>

<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol of the tape drives, to indicate that the band has been embedded. in the statusbar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps up the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; specifies a change to the band to recognise that the integration for the band has been resolved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be kicked out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape & kdat; can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat;</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band modes have to be formatted before you use to store data. this process does not need to be formatted before using the tape & kdat; this process does not have to be formatted before you use the tape by & kdat; however, floppy tape drives are usually not set to formulate DAT drives.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band called and the capacity, & kdat; with the formatting of the band. all data on the band are lost! after the conclusion of the formatting process the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup procedure, you have to select the backup files. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Mark a secure profile profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to re-create the band indexfile on the basis of the tape. this process deletes all existing Indexfiles for this band. you can reproduce the index to two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a safety profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make a safety profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current workfolder, where the backup is to be done. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected workfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders that are listed under securing files, that only the files can be secured on the same file system, as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can enter separately under securing files. each entry is recognized by tar regardless of the other file system files.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used since the last incremental backup. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to change the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; and lt; files; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings via the menu item KDat... in menu settings. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file system (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to non-reaction version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, conveys & kdat; before the band is integrated, the command will be switched to the drive. for some drives this is necessary to be performed before reading or write operations.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, & kdat; unlock the ejection of the tape drive. maybe this setting does not work with all band drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, it is automatically discarded to the integration of & kdat; automatically use the tape. do not use this option for floppy streaming.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, it is trying to change & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter whether this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case the block size for your band work will be notified.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, write a file to the start of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the file is set up as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is machine name: seconds, where computer name is the full name of the system, on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch has been formatted in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the band are pure tar -archives that can manage directly with & GNU; - tar manage. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not around incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for unwanted users where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in the various protocol. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the program is suitable for unwanted users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored in the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog allows users to provide fast access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore try to provide some advanced functions using their help to filtered the protocol-files certain programs filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog has a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in this manual and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screen photo, & kinteglog; functions are available, with their help the individual protocol-lines of a Protocol file can be filtering and sort. the individual options for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the launch, & ksystematic log; first the most important protocol-file of the system - the system log file is launched, and it opens instead of Linux normally in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter according to a selected criterion or in the filter bar. the list of log-lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only log-line display will be displayed next to the selected filter. then a log line is displayed only if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search term.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select a different entry at this point. if the string of the filter search term will only be selected with entries in accordance to the selected column, and in addition, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines which have been sent or created from this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. record lines of level error are displayed with a plain color as protocol-lines of the level reference. the color presentation of protocol-lines can be connected to setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system log or in cron protocol), you can then be useful to examine the process identification (PID) in the process process. this may be useful for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the option to create new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a submenu, select a Log in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystematic log.forum-software.orchar.Dort you will find more information about the removal sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion Archives: ksystemlog; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named as named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The V Init system rapidly develops into the standard for checking the system start of the system in the & Linux; world. and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to implement a machine on System V Init without a new installation and reformat. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was there one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SYSV Init also differs from the BSD init that the config files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you find rc.sysinit and following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d includes a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start the system or change at a different runlevel. system services include such things such as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such stuff like setserial, which is only once launched. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if it actually doesn't have much use for it. you can also use a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something you want to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is searching for different positions following the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can toss a look into the second column, and probably determine that the default runlevel 3 is possible. if you want to change it, then you can carry out / etc / inittab by hand, then you can fix it if you restart the system and run the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stops init actually system services? quite simple: every scripting is written so that it is an argument such as start and stop accepted. you can actually run this scripts by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes, the script will be called stop by the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server Runlevel, which lets you run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of availability to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stopping).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runlevels or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. this is only done by its original runlevel (or its position). this only happens if they pull out an entry from the field of disposition services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be postponed if you prefer to copy them into a new runlevel. to select them only to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the menu Edit or from the context menu, and even if the same entry exists previously in the target range of action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of a single entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that have been thrown into the Recycle Bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 Start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an entry into manually, press the tab button to change the properties dialog by typing the button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Due to the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu will require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. defaults to the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc), if they are available. otherwise, they will be saved by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've been experimented with the standard Runleveling, and now the machine starts constantly. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">In the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in the single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The type, such as system services started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary single programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) simply quit if their configuration files are not present or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser;</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you made changes, you need to save them. either use the corresponding icon of the tool bar or the entry store in the File Menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cards, user and user links. to edit, select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the user or group features.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards will only be displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you are able to make sure maps (Quota) for users, it will appear on which you can make individual settings, if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The map for passwords appears if shadow passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card box appears only if it is activated and initialized (visible at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can change parameters for any user parameters, and the placements are given in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card groups provides information about the group-related user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primur Group. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting these in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Group's dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, check this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select the user or group menu or click the matching Add button of toolbar. edit or delete the selected user or the selected group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO BootManager, remove and change the boot password, add the time to the booting of the standard operating system, add the default operating system to change, change, change, change, change and more.</seg>
