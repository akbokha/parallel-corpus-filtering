although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordin@@ arily great .
like many of my generation , I also grew up with American movies , danced to American music and operated by American writers .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the Grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ tham in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less rep@@ orter who wanted to occupy the mur@@ der@@ ous con@@ spiracy of an oil magn@@ ate with judges who were in@@ quired of his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; freely to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was it as if that &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish letter of love about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most unusual aspect of his asc@@ ension is for me , how he moves with his engines .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and explains publicly his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women .
nevertheless people have re@@ acted to their statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes , which he won with rep@@ ubli@@ can elections , was the highest number ever achieved by the party .
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ker person , I asked myself ?
I could not bring Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people that I had met in Phoenix during my time .
as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , the people from all over the world , a deep belie@@ ver man , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
in addition , Tr@@ umps did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ ump Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr who fights for her life for the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise Council helped me a lot in my career .
these people , and they em@@ bodied by them , deep@@ ened my love in America .
while Tr@@ ump gave his way to the rep@@ ubli@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate , they gave me a stop and the opposite of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the struggle with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they either shared rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism , because they were ready to over@@ look these things , I broke my heart .
perhaps it &apos;s un@@ fair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a breed .
one of my friends , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ t@@ ful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in another way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most know are , for tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comm@@ its the cruel decision to raise a man who looks like contemp@@ t for those who look different than he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 4 m . ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; word play from white in recording to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it called the big Van Jones , exactly that which America made so magnificent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have , America is called everyone .
for this country chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crowd rep@@ lied with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they bre@@ wed the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered them .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who isn &apos;t like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican musical school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
the music that is played on both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 , an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds from the nearby splendid ruins and its world famous cuisine .
for a couple of years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra composed of children and adults , which with their musical instruments a way to overcome them surrounding poverty .
a music school with 100 students for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero has become the central interest in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community that is located in one of the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os is known for their drugs abuse and gangs .
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project , and the youth so offered a rare hope .
the young band members take their comm@@ it@@ ments against the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI means :
once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and play with shiny eyes and play in the action you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from W@@ aste
more than 7.000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically on the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material :
music with re @-@ prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recy@@ c@@ ler had begun to turn parts of waste in instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , C@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion which all were made from the garbage .
the re@@ pertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as the music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez , a local eco @-@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of the time :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them did not live together with their children .
that changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today , there is a whole orchestra which plays on the instruments made of recycled material and the The Recy@@ cled Orchestra is called .
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance on :
every year the world produces approximately one billion metric tons of waste .
those who live with him and of him are the troubles - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectac@@ le from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that describes targeted solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publishing occurs within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before it explored the other coast of Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the East African countries were brought upward and inc@@ lined to welcome a criminal law of this type on their co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ore , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobili@@ zed themselves rapidly against the ship . they refused to carry out one of their har@@ bours and refused to share a fishing stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who simply refused to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commemor@@ ates Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive officer of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship during a time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch fish there .
finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , due to pill@@ age the fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by N@@ RO Stop illegal fishing ( Il@@ legal fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries to work together and work together . they exchange information and stand each other with illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is not regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track , so illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystem damage , which have a delicate balance .
yet while actions against illegal fishing could be disabled through bureau@@ cr@@ atic hur@@ dles , and also through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions now happen in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ able at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange existing lic@@ ences , such lists , susp@@ ect news , or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very carefully when they move on the open seas , using satellite data .
it enables the authorities to identify the ships that fish in banned areas . even so susp@@ ects that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the operators have a fishing license where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing companies may refuse to accept such ships in their har@@ bours , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can be forced to sell their cargo as in case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally not worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a report that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed Front
the so @-@ called platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industries , which attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these , even those illeg@@ itim@@ ate fisher@@ man .
among their practices , actions include actions such as the sailing under false flag , counter@@ feit licensing papers , giving fancy species , fish protected species and the fish in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use specifically the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ incomplete control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ship was illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You may not walk my port &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just this legal swal@@ lowing is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspic@@ ious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks which had spread counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships which used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it .
due to its collaboration with Inter@@ pol , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , suspic@@ ious ships to be precise .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed , also helps to track the illegal ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , a NGO which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch on , for example , their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be used by satellite .
Cop@@ eland helps to build a system which links various information about the other . F@@ ISH @-@ i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened jointly with Google and the Maritime conservation organisation Oce@@ ana to open the platform Global Fishing Watch : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to stand up their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel crimin@@ als , but they also d@@ eter them .
ships used earlier without license and hardly faced with consequences , know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ ISH @-@ i had a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales , since fishing boats more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board drag@@ ged networks , whose use is forbidden .

&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ il@@ u says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study objective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear through illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have merged into the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with safety , the aim is to produce more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country was able to report his first major triumph in Somalia : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under incorrect flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used by drag@@ ged networks which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was still entered into banned waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collabor@@ ative work for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world Ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spread : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to conquer the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of heavy demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the amend@@ ment of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations carried out on the political and economic crisis of the country in laying down on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments against and against them .
the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among others in the flat region of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ den@@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , located in the centrally located German Parliament Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva .
the political and economic situation of the country is deteri@@ or@@ ating continuously , resulting in everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance to have a fundamental change in the govern@@ ance of the current president Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the post@@ ure was blocked by the official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in its latest article the context of government publication as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and Ge@@ wal@@ tr@@ ates belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine was considered the only way to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to include a new alliance .
the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups called together , called to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace , to the Venezu@@ elan government , on November 3 , the block@@ ade of the refer@@ end@@ ums should continue to continue .
the call was commented on Twitter among others , as follows :
it is where Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nation@@ wide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Caracas to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace .

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration within the framework of the Action Program &quot; The withdrawal of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real @-@ time will testify among others an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the protective shield , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You will kill me because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will kill me because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Vene@@ tians are scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter records images that tell from disputes , as well as reports of op@@ pression and mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
especially large waves struck the message of police supp@@ ression in the central @-@ north of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement in front of police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later , they could leave the cathedral back safely , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat ( T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira ) :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira have no skirts because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alities do not have !
meanwhile , an inf@@ ograph@@ ics makes the round , which forms the magn@@ itude to op@@ pression per day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a minist@@ erial procedure - this was now proved in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs found :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures have been fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your counter@@ part !
on the road !
other values took these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that caused little against the devast@@ ating economic crisis and would rather have been busy making critical voices .
they took us so much - but fear !
the mar@@ ches always take over frequency and intensity .
some Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry for taking part in a strike rather than to go shopping or to go shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ in@@ ean news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city CÃ³rdoba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now said in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father .
the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept secret sec@@ rec@@ y for himself .
in the situation I believed that was fine .
I felt like an obe@@ dient .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
I could not realise that my father was a thief , fol@@ k@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ wicz . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was deputy commander of the secret services department 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ press@@ ors who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who knew the extent of atro@@ cities which he had experienced as boy , and who spoke before a federal court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I had been friends with a boy , who made martial sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and urged me to identify my friend .
he said :

therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me down to the military base .
he told me , I would be obe@@ dient .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for so my father loved me .
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university clas@@ ps , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the car , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small wrapped packages and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ rack , where the stolen items were removed and enter@@ tained me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I walked in and saw a song that were tor@@ tured on the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that it fast@@ ened the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just there .
they rarely have a man with palms of the bed , poured it with water and pursued it a charge of 220 volts to gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was unbe@@ ar@@ able ... as a dirty wind farm .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I realized the smell immediately and it became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget that smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the det@@ ain@@ ees were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were carried away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilian , who was also indicted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to cast a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people were facing down - all were folded in hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance people were silent on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like this , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I lost &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you taught me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit , and was buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father told her home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were referred to as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck and killed a man there .
( according to the survivors of the Civil Society , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was also indicted by the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads to former torture chambers .
the path that you came in here is also the way , on which they came here .
when looking at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process of determination .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the above came , that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the po@@ uring of the people and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things back home .
at that time at age I had no idea what the &quot; war &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign that is fought by an enemy who is fighting .

but when one walks into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war , but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I don &apos;t understand it simply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer at the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything therein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
once he called me a crimin@@ als and I answered : and thou , who rode on the road on the road ?
you are not crimin@@ als ?
he explo@@ ded on anger , struck me and cried :
when you go so far , then I &apos;ll find you and conf@@ using you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover made of wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , I accused the defense of being a fellow in this crime . I said no problem , they can lay down to me what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ The dis@@ appearance of the body is the last shy act &apos; .
now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ented .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
it is evol@@ ving and recogni@@ zes that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
so good , so you ex@@ chan@@ ted during the dictatorship of people . but why the bodies of the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why do children dec@@ eive ?
one day , my father brought a girl to his house whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always posed the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could just have been put in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their bodies should disappear ?
did these people not have their families who was able to pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the body is the last shy act that you can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to eliminate the remains of prisoners .
they were crushed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; my father said .
but anything remains forever .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
to say , I have nothing against the military .
I even stayed with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
the thought , to show my father , arose during an interview when he was under house arrest .
I made his accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have killed anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ cor@@ rupted and asked me , why all the displac@@ ed patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I saw how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes , and you forced me to tell me as a child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only answered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I don &apos;t show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I refunded the first ad .
I had finally realized that he was a crimin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can imagine that I am pre@@ set . I finally told my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .

after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera &apos;s trial ended for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims eventually in August of 1975 and December 1978 .
43 op@@ press@@ ors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . the Court suspended life sentences in 28 cases , and in nine cases sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was free trial .

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto too &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a centre in K@@ YO@@ TO , where you can extend its license .
the photo was spread in social media .
editing the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month wit@@ ness@@ ing a very special translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign the Japanese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means , but perhaps - perhaps also with bad background thank &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong translation has been available from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the input area and in the building itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often divided into social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ oto . he was also who made local newspapers attentive to this .
the liberal daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city as &quot; Kyoto &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Holmes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ matic not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text that they had received from trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not checked for their correc@@ t@@ ness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that older people felt imp@@ acted by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) for our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat somewhat more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an un@@ reasonable description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers are involved in accidents , but are definitely to worry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by Sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 80@@ 3 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents decline in total , the proportion of sen@@ iors resulted in the same period in the same period .
the previously named rep@@ orter brought comments to light , which show comments on Yahoo , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese seem@@ ingly viol@@ ates older drivers :
the article on Yahoo via translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful driving &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If the translation is really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not few such comments .
why the &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread all over Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true finds for this bizarre bug in English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are mani@@ fold .
you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language .
the latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native speakers . generally , the convic@@ tion that trans@@ lators in the target language - not in the initial language - should not be native speakers .
a French native language should be translated from English to French , not from French to English .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be based on lack of understanding for belief , reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees , nevertheless let translations produce fir@@ men@@ internally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is the best , to trans@@ lators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wor@@ ries and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences which are created through mach@@ ined translations will show that this technology can still not replace a human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic ac@@ ies that often decorate T @-@ Shirts or hand@@ bags , are only used for sty@@ li@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo of Flickr @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless . but of big companies or by the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and cen@@ sored measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) .
Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , they don &apos;t have access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the Internet presentation of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV could not be accessible as well .
other on @-@ line radio broad@@ casts the protests in Caracas , which were organized by opposition groups who oppos@@ e Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros government .
the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the tasks of Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link was p@@ aired , and recommended to use the user , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access Internet access .
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that web pages of Venezu@@ elan Provider are again blocked .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; traditional media have been re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ant since 2014 on protests of protests . at that time , the Commission threatened to report on them with monetary policy and closure when the Commission would continue to report this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appeal to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO of VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ let not only confirmed that Viv@@ op@@ lay is not only accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly transfers their meetings .
earlier research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , showed that the local Internet operators are able to use DNS . it is a technique if certain domain requests concerning certain domains are incorrect .
when a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers or ref@@ uses the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who transmitted the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody .
Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government is regulated by the government to provide access to multi @-@ media coverage over recent events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls will get a slave to obtain an apprentic@@ eship
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ b@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Kur@@ ier , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which is processed and re@@ released by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not living together with the family who was allowed to eat .
shortly before she graduated at the university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house talked of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something from something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas , man referred to the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
business is quite simple : a large family with little money gives her min@@ ent son or her min@@ ent daughter to another , abundant family . in the exchange the child will receive food , education and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that you can not lift up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice is widely distributed in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
upon completion of her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness statements , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things in the name , as the feeling of gratitude which is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , are generally not silent in general .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of the family that their daughter in the belief that they do so their training to improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can do something out of himself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family , who decreases the girl with himself and justify their exploitation with faith , that they would not give someone a chance that would not get an apprentic@@ eship otherwise , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is har@@ assed , his family will experience only many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , this has been a relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of severe strokes . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military service Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant when resident .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
by the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed as long as a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n , until they suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they insist@@ ed that the murdered child was a cri@@ mp@@ ita .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply involved in the par@@ agu@@ an society of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s death for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest against protest@@ ations and demanded that &quot; no further Carolina &quot; could be found in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control , among which conditions boys and girls live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a spe@@ edy study of the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case is before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay , a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , who worked in her father , had to register and lost her father &apos;s work .
their brothers had to work all now and began to sell on the street or on the market swe@@ ets to earn money .
but they went all further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
in the house of their employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
they had to divide the time so that you remained still time for learning .
she stood at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
for example , they pur@@ ified the fridge , plast@@ ered the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor .
when the school was at the end , she went back home and had time to learn .
the more they finished with learning , the more leisure she had .
but also this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but I had not unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a secret military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and to read books from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith in the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held them for intelligent , but did not inter@@ fere with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn &quot; bad habit . &quot; so she said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , at home again her mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ would speak .

the company appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share the job for cleaning staff and children &apos;s cities in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ sti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays in the morning and in the afternoon with her .
to learn .
please call you .
start on Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a beautiful girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes little children and is very beautiful , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the state of the country that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author then switched itself once more :
dear girl@@ friends , I found one . I look at whether it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again when something is .
the shop was completed .

bill design describes Egyptian users of social media , pre @-@ register to the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; six@@ ty Egyptian par@@ liament@@ arians have recently voted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regulation on the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he is accepted by Parliament , users and social media have to register in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law there would then be set up a place which is mand@@ ated to share citizens with permission to share social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with acceptance of the law , pay@@ ers and users must register on the site with their correct names and identity numbers to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt , defined social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jed@@ we@@ de &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video editing and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is un@@ clear as the law is passed when the draft is to be imposed on the registration , as the Egyptian government shall not account for those who account the Egyptian government to ensure that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ler , parliamentary committ@@ ees and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get through fire@@ wall , which blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not known so far that such plans consist .
experts and experts on @-@ site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Pre@@ dic@@ tory Research ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal Rights ) , &quot; Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt strongly in the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that same as they do not control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , this means that it will be a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens , who want to apply for a hom@@ olog@@ ation or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor men &apos;s activities and also to bring it to a court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the Legisl@@ ative of Parliament and the Constitutional committ@@ ees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his acceptance and en@@ forcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating Nar@@ ration is present on the screen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of bill against Cyber @-@ Crime in which a lifel@@ ong sentence for those was intended to be found guilty of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in nor@@ theastern Iraq , the animal prot@@ erin H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGOs work in Nature Iraq to protect the ghost of Persian Leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of Leop@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to the loss of their habitat , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as Raz@@ a appears in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining rocket in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and the increase of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big noise is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the free wild r@@ ink is low and goes against zero . when the team is found in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks in pure joy .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress that had been achieved for the past six years to revi@@ ve the life of those who had been hit by the &quot; thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Send@@ ai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was in Japan &apos;s northeast , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been settled , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had all coastal cities van@@ ished from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture still experienced a nuclear accident , so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o shows the progress of six years later , in order to rebuild the local people &apos;s life .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building and survey results of the victims themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( born in the earlier , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) , in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were completed .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could see the largest success of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima comes with 70 percent of its final light .
still , six years after the disaster , he had to be evacu@@ ated after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by master@@ pieces ( formerly known , Kaz@@ ak@@ su ju@@ ch@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts to settle .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers .
in December of 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such accommodation .
almost 40 percent of the event in 2011 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in not@@ ices , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of evacu@@ ated companies were res@@ ett@@ led after the disaster in containers were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
while almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have been restored .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , largely affected in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely again , but Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist tax in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however , however , can have only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine a total picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacu@@ ation by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she asked about the stand of re@@ building and also how their feeling is changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her introduction of the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population in experience .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local resident companies have taken measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents is that still not enough in cat@@ astroph@@ es .
how it is for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture .
in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the situation of evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
Fu@@ kus@@ hima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devast@@ ating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ caused , nuclear accident , nuclear accident .
at 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses .
after the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture .
in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated ones , which still exist in containers are more than 50 years old . they have to compete in right comfort for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects , which will be part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people meet people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
after a while , one often recogni@@ zes that one more combines more than the first glance .
these global connections are important because they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world ultimately is very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we treat topics that get fewer attention in coverage than they deserve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember one moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva from a common photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had struck him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nation@@ wide , millions of protest@@ ers took part in a protest march towards austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ deer trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now put him into a artificial coma .
its condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus spreading rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures also the face of the police officers , who was attacked with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident the military police in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the end of the pre @-@ examination of the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
would a police officer beaten up from a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire op@@ pression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several wash@@ rooms shortly afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective , is also sur@@ faced in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a part of the costs for medical treatment and to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father , because he has been attacked the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools because he has been attacked by a police station , after being attacked by a polic@@ emen , who has hit him with a stroke .
police transfer
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police action on Friday last Friday .
polic@@ emen were used in protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , social and peace party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in from violence against protest@@ ers .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country .
once again the Brazilian media have del@@ etes the road by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window to design with a photo of its cover pages .
the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a bus in fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window disc than the protests of the thousand people who serve the defense of a special issue .
this must also acknowledge if one is strictly opposed to any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets an absurd , un@@ disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are conf@@ isc@@ ated with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of forgotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso included almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba ( Photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of that there are no notable sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years ago when the activities were paraly@@ zed in the sugar cane factories .
after the vom@@ it the sugar cane industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 272 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changes the job .
others re@@ sign and comm@@ uting a day to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a Sol@@ dier @-@ Dec@@ eter@@ an , who stands up at 4 : 00 every day , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not scre@@ wed his sleep .
he heard that in the East of the region sugar cane factories , they are back into operation after a long in@@ active period because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene remember exactly that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not held .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the message could have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest@@ ing have been no longer new .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform saw better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.0@@ 3 euros ) .
the solution for the unemployment ?
the mot@@ if@@ s that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price climbed again approximately a decade ago .
from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural Per@@ spectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , Agricultural and Food Organisation ( United Nations ) .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day is to go down with security in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene is known as a soldier , over the closure of the factory speaks , the word that he is repe@@ ating most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all those questioned agree : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
in order to receive the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first press , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents which only differ in terms of parts that would be removed , addressing the mailing and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ster Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any appro@@ ve .
from then on , the responsibility was arrested and the letters were increasingly frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for the shut @-@ off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will at the feeding of the factory , in whose construction he helped , involved .
with every part he removed , he demonstrated one of his 31 years of working .
the industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been ext@@ ingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the congreg@@ ations in which they were created .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the present persons , when he assured that the factories , whose factories have no longer been in operation for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the local community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane was closed , or better said than they began to take it off , they also listened to asphalt , this dis@@ advant@@ aged , also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they were split to spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene was back to the company Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty harvest@@ ing bring the old soldiers a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is no re@@ tra@@ geous person , yet he gives the lies that they told him .
they tou@@ red him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes to R@@ ente with 65 years , not because it is missing at strength , but because he is bit@@ tered .

as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop guides mobil@@ es directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , which lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is increasing by the young participants in discussions like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever occurs in the sense . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the yo@@ ungst@@ ers are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations @-@ Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um first nation in British Columbia tells for example the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not solved .
the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to conv@@ ey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influence of glob@@ alization .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , even though the youth did not always prevail in the languages of First Nations .
in the following song that Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the Re@@ fra@@ in is sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip Hop group , who gave them a verse in the dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the fac@@ ebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day you will lose our cry
because we have lost our way to life in life
but I believe that we will raise us one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also lead to our youth .
so they can do that , why she determines the Creator
in the comment section , the reader and author of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a contribution and adds the verse of sy@@ ll@@ ery ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , what exactly is on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( formerly known as the &quot; Plast@@ ics &quot; of the courts &quot; ) of every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they are entering the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual that they did not even notice them any more . however , a new trend is turning them today in show@@ y mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now on special sale : new with plastic dishes , decorated mobile tapes , as shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , cooling disease mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ ck@@ down fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of food processing is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone support .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here &apos;s an apple that keeps your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing aer@@ ob@@ atic flight .
some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon are used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can che@@ ated my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting ice .
in addition there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ ons made of dried salmon .
further sk@@ ur@@ ry plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # , in the beginning .
if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; in reports in and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ chie@@ fly and killed are regularly in statistics . these reflect at all the extent of the human tragedy , which brings together this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , head of the Sin@@ al@@ oa Pl@@ ells , pushed the stories of the conflict totally in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day after a violent incident , anyone looks at the trau@@ mas or the churches which have learned to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are behind each body , behind every bone fund in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds will never cure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico formed the digital project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn to live with drug traff@@ icking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) that these victims should give a voice and stories of people told them in the struggle between criminal authorities and cart@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime does not only let us fear our lives .
the effects are much profound .
for example , if shops close because they are threatened by drug retailers and all mun@@ icipalities therefore need to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is looking for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task that we have asked us to go , and to graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on 15 October he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult for me because I &apos;m alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not get paid out , because they demand a death certificate .
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; Apr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the govern@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ HB , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this contribution from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter in which form it occurs :
I have been acquain@@ ted with illness and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism since a few years now .
I &apos;m passing by news@@ letters every day and see the cover pages with images that can only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is ob@@ tain@@ ted or sad . it works as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traff@@ ick@@ ers ) if it is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they were those who have lost someone and those who are afraid to have them something like that .
I see our weakness when stories to block numbers in a statist@@ ic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighbour that they were justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to talk that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they are not stirring and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this she describes how armed crimin@@ als were destroyed for the month of money from their business , until they did not only destroy the business , but also their family torn apart .
you think about everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we just contact us if it &apos;s absolutely necessary .
the more we are from each other , the better .
she completed her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kill or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked me in these terrible days , if weeping would resolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
he is not like other young boys of his age , their parents take care of them .
Bryan is a f@@ ather@@ less and he tells himself to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , torti@@ llas warm , and &quot; ch@@ ichi &quot; for the babies who dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ search@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father saw , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of mur@@ ders based on public security and government of the government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the public pro@@ secutor requested 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to the average of 8,5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are only a few hundred thousand stories that are leaving the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate into the soul of the country .
few stories live in view of always new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; Apr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; proclaimed Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 , whose goal is to project the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traff@@ icking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades in understand@@ able way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Flickr user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages on which he linked , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fac@@ simile check is important at a moment in which it &apos;s about to raise a rum@@ or or to un@@ mask a f@@ ake .
but how is this years after something the first time has emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , ten@@ ds to pers@@ ist further .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first publication it was used to be mis@@ chief , trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this false p@@ airing of picture and event - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false description &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; false context &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is much me@@ tic@@ ul@@ ous reporting on events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it raises questions about our longing for pictures to News .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became more dangerous trails that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically he fell victim to the victims .
Government Repres@@ ent@@ ative described a Fire@@ ball , who covered dozens of houses including a movie the@@ aters , which was full of people who were full of football clubs .
houses burned and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make the horri@@ ble scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of hollow body lined up on the ground while people are looking at it .
but here the story does not end .
over the years the same photo was en@@ ched several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but certainly not in the context of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am seized the remote Nig@@ erian village of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities , before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bus@@ hes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were mu@@ til@@ ated , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the military base at Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again , as it was proof of the fact and the potential dimension of attack was presented :
it is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , the mis@@ use of the image from the DR of Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ abor@@ tions ; Africa check has documented assign@@ ments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was introduced as a cover for mass deser@@ ts .
yet another step further bring personal comments like this example due to the image from the DR Congo to the sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee , rape , and several dead , some were burned by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following reference to summar@@ ize these descriptions with photos from the DRC :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arabic news page , which claimed 2012 , the president My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ an being said , mon@@ ks and politicians could have participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image of the DRC to illustrate this information .
the original entry , which was last modified on 26 April 2017 , can be called here .
other news organizations that they called AF@@ P as their source were also due to being attributed to Th@@ an His statement , but had not expressed this picture from the DR Congo in connection .
the worldwide operating range of false statements
traces of these false alle@@ g@@ ations go back to the year 2011 and 2012 , and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reverse picture look with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are similar to the following picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private parties , platforms of social media and community and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , others have attempted to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have posted examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page it has been published . this way , we want to represent the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may also be used from the countries listed below ( in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can be split yet completely ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News frames .
examples of false cop@@ ulation of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries refer to pages or server , via the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ tering are still available .
the countries in grey are examples which are available according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counter@@ feit examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Alg@@ erian and interested Arabs ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hist@@ s against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this article was published by 2014 about students who have been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the German Catholic News page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly explained that the image is not from the k@@ ill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ail @-@ dist@@ ic attack . &quot;
when the picture later occurred in the connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te it to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ di@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dis@@ b@@ anded a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the connection on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were those of these events , alleged to be alleged in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was wit@@ tered as proof for the massac@@ res of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were seized in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( portu@@ guese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message had been written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Martos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre in circulation , there were discussion discussion such as this here on Vietnamese and declared it to Fal@@ con . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the message that was included in the picture of the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Martos .
there are further confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other accounts , ag@@ ul@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entry with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and ver@@ bs them via image dat@@ amen in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly following the original accident of 2010 , the picture probably could possibly have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( in@@ verteb@@ rates ) that make these posts through . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in regards to greater discussions about the silence in the context of Muslims by Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hist@@ s .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
religion can understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth exploring how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers cannot give these pictures longer faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media there are dirty people who in@@ advert@@ ise it , to tr@@ ash the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and di@@ lap@@ id@@ eth the real atro@@ cities of what actually happened in the DRC , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of for@@ cible images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that the re@@ jection of images of a ref@@ usal to recognize the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that for@@ cible images of readers and viewers des@@ i@@ ze them to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , who under@@ went how for@@ cible media act on it ) .
while there is a lot about violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologists experiment because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you will thoroughly think about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but it can also be solved by context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive manner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any investigation false app@@ or@@ tions should also be considered as internationally as internationally .

the &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog covers uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Simm@@ ons uses according to CC BY @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ man@@ age@@ able ) tries to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate .
there are words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these im@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist hard stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly a simple translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant to this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected in an online list for all time .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
in the blog , for example , one finds words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ h to help your parents in recognition of how to have tried yourself in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the comfort or slo@@ th@@ ness you feel after you have grown in cold days in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they dis@@ gr@@ ind other cultures , reve@@ aling other thoughts and ar@@ ising our curiosity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ist on this page and show more of this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; Treas@@ ure &quot; , who are very much appreciated by Un@@ tran@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst Fl@@ ut@@ kat@@ astrophe of the decade
the island nation of Sri Lanka is currently the worst high water and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by mon@@ soon , which is usually end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , Gin , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya in 15 districts occur in the south and west of the country .
following an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of the floods and sl@@ ammed winds .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe stay .
the rain falls on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the floods in some areas went slowly .
health and hygiene relationships represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos conv@@ ey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ ef@@ ie@@ ve crisis , Save the Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle also flooded the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a river .
the Air Force has made five aircraft for rescue operations and further five will be made ready for transport of emergency supplies for the residents made in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start@@ ups have also been able to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water situation and human@@ ist help .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their surg@@ eries , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
we are today in the region around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ at@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
the taxi company Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app to inform the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ony centre .
last year after the catastrophe of the Trop@@ y Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me brought a &quot; high water aid &quot; button to call a vehicle to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance from assistance and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Red Cross for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; similarly , they introduced a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to result in more than thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ at@@ eries actions for flood water and land@@ slides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri L@@ ank@@ as , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring people in need in need and make assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way up to rest@@ oring norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that you can not see
Women &apos;s March 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
when in January I took part in Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and loving friend .
I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we call for par@@ oles for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we tend to transfer rights for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating par@@ oles against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; which has built up in their concept .
they mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice differently our religion .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different art . but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , which , as I do not clean@@ se there , can be removed .
to be shu@@ ff@@ led
I do not get alone .
that is even the poet , whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images are coming to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day that he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the Western conception , religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been colon@@ ised for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pione@@ ering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid joined the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images also rise further .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continues to ste@@ er them .
I have worked for thir@@ teen years in the news industry and I saw how this powerful , incorrect nar@@ rative of our news@@ feeds domin@@ ate .
this scar over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this scar will fail to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from doing their head@@ scarf in public buildings and to cover su@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which both are both sides of the same medal .
a powerful group pract@@ ises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot;
this powerful nar@@ rative weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change .
it looks that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil from Afri@@ cans , which were brought to slave vessels .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this nar@@ rative has deeply occupied our collective imagination , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of tim@@ us@@ li@@ mic attacks and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories , we tell you about the way we tell them is Islam@@ opho@@ bia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion dollars
in the news industry , we are doing more than just stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rative , which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are making the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of the ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants from the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ cian from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan thought the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ affected Muslims and Americans .
but am I now confused as Muslims and Americans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if people ask me why I do not eat pork meat , I tell you - instead of taking my Muslim recipes or put my hand@@ bag , all Muslims in themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from respect to Pepp@@ a W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scher@@ ze , we do not wear all the hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also have to be a the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight far widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ ist machinery , think tanks and experts for fal@@ se@@ information , which is already a faulty picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell you and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than a stranger , who r@@ ushes the head@@ scarf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or as the fri@@ ghtening card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the United States , see below .
screenshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ugly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it takes our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it can &apos;t fit into a drawer .
the author was in 1986 on a photo of her kinder@@ gart@@ ens group .
use approved .
I would like to explain that .
I was born as the Muslim but a Muslim first became in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York .
if social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be seen , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslims , when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ able ritual with my daughter when I kept them in my arms , and to protect the Arab verses , which inv@@ ades the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ AS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask therefore that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one can &apos;t see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim faith may not always be seen , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the Grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , po@@ si@@ ating with her sisters in the 1960s .
use approved .
affili@@ ation is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal side with her sisters ; as they can win a competition of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi in decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes when I close my eyes : Nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings with many book@@ marks , a book with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and four@@ teen chapters that they can almost complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to be the prayers , which she had said to me when I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims , as she taught me to relate to God , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - through a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was founded by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author was in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging to this means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my own grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books about the modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an said to her family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , whom he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century .
belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palest@@ inians whose families have been torn apart from my grandfather , col@@ oni@@ alists who have dealt with the Muslim world as at stake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have nation@@ alized all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that the first fli@@ ght@@ bomb of the story was rejected by a Muslim country over a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir of the British Empire , was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet before there were planes , he traveled in more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plugged history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means that four ten years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that have been distributed over every continent apart from Antarc@@ tica , to pursue mass destruction of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the suicide rate of veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the United States and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slave .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ l@@ aved and brought to this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams and when we say black life .
an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nar@@ rative of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in a reduced dou@@ bt@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother meant to worry about my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this dou@@ bling of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regist@@ rations that started with President Bush and have been wi@@ dened by President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
she is in the immig@@ rant officials , who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders across people from just the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely assumes Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw away from Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those who we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title Asc@@ ent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western university participants showed a scientifically im@@ real picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversation that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to im@@ an@@ ise the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ t@@ ful and dangerous expression of expression that we unite in our news editors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tried to detect our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast lake Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Podcast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; a initiative to print Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IST@@ AN@@ ISH , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned with this difficult global point of time , in which we are located .
and that moment the consequences will go beyond 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that con@@ spiracy the@@ or@@ ists who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years before it had not yet been given to them ; now they control large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about real@@ ities and history , which I was not aware of it when I was so old now , as I was now my daughter , but who today made me a mur@@ mu@@ te Muslim today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b track in my speech .
things that might wake up rec@@ ol@@ le@@ ctions , because in all the inter@@ sections that makes our humanity a story likes to l@@ ur@@ k , where someone is made to another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , con@@ vers@@ ations will take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred acade@@ m@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; others , &quot; structural rac@@ ism , and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms , with whom we usually throw in our schools to cast us or we read in our papers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why did I tell us this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where , however , Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and killed by the monkeys of the &quot; other &quot; in the public performance , four decades even the scientist Stan@@ ford was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to put ourselves un@@ comfortable questions in the role of his own , deliber@@ ately and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it is a new future in which we have no president to feed the chocolate cake , while already cap@@ sul@@ ated countries and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; killed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are far beyond the visible and invisible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1,7 billion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it begins with all of us .

for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the lists of stories in their original language is a possible answer .

in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia , or in O@@ ak@@ land , in the United States where T@@ LS has already carried out events , the risk that small and not so small languages are not to be passed on to the children there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities , the diversity of diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to be attributed to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often listen to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate the listen@@ ers to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their history first in their own language and then translate them to English .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dev@@ otion and presentation lead to that the listen@@ er will be on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ ellers Ras@@ si@@ dat@@ ou gave account the opportunity to explain the stor@@ yt@@ elling of stor@@ yt@@ elling .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the fork of the har@@ es and the b@@ abo@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after he explains the meaning of his fork , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of inclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were quite with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling have taken place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can organise together with T@@ LS in order to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .
Puerto Rico calls on the US Neu@@ consoli@@ date of the sovereig@@ n debt
with the aim of a new examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took part in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organisations involved in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Pu@@ call@@ ian Capit@@ ol , the capital building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( The citizen for the ne@@ ural examination of the debt ) and the O@@ kom@@ en@@ ian Church Assembly , Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ate of the re@@ mission of debts have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Puerto R@@ ican people calls for politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for debts to their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for financial examination and a management committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions sti@@ pul@@ ated in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto R@@ ican ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not her .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be deduc@@ ted with dec@@ aying retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not into the international territory of the United States - suff@@ ers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state of state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto R@@ ican requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures imposed on the outside will run without the participation and convic@@ tion of citizens &apos; danger to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; Night@@ watch for Light and Truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue their campaign for his freedom and remind us of the contributions he has provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , Managing Director by book Spr@@ ints &apos; finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ struc@@ tions ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective night@@ fall ) .
the book , which was published last year and licensed here , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in face of op@@ pression .
it is a homage to bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is :
this book wants to discuss how mot@@ ions for free knowledge will be built and what the true costs are linked to those of them .
activists , artist , designer , developers , developers , developers , developers and authors contributed to the movements for free knowledge , to look over the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and accla@@ imed Internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted in the A@@ dra pris@@ ons directory in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
we have no information about its present state or place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice based on his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , and immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , has many of us begin to reflect on their own destiny , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what do we have given up to extreme beliefs in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist since March 2012 has been detained at Syrian government agencies .
in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown location .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as in@@ si@@ ders of the Assad administration and put them in knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his residence and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and moment@@ arily the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps no one of Bas@@ sel &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pre@@ viewing than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ ward of many ci@@ vil@@ is@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bas@@ sel couldn &apos;t know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strike in digital Archae@@ ology and Conservation has created a time capsule created for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future of in@@ valuable value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel has not yet been able to close this project yet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spent my overall life to dream of freedom and from Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel made me English , even when he was already detained .
I have learned to read , write and speak English .
he has always been sharing his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also contributed to other prisoners , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without having actually thought of them in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a professional journal , which she wrote in years from 2012 to 2015 , when he was in detention .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together in the book for one year .
she conf@@ essed the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it into English from Arabic .
the book is licensed free .
book cover from Yous@@ sef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens during each visit ,
that I fail in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace us ,
that every man doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and watch@@ men
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I penet@@ rate every detail of your voice and words
I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say farewell
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to get rid of all those moments ,
and to cry and smile upon your absence .
I think myself , that I will return soon ...
the first anniversary of the arrest of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
one year passes , my soul
while on , during the
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage in the monster
Bas@@ sel Story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 65@@ ,000 people disappeared .
those who were arrested or deported to the regime , were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans in prison .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today , we re@@ iter@@ ate our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : attributed to Cor@@ ruption of Cor@@ ruption of Pro@@ mis@@ sal Con@@ tract again
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption in which a governmental member returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence .
this is where Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison along with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 euros ) .
the money was from public funds of the airports of Mozambique , whose Council stood at Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for a good tour and immediately requested his attitude into the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with an opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which proposed the application , there would be no obstacle reason for Cam@@ b@@ aza , back to his old post , since the company was not a disciplinary procedure according to his detention .
however , many people do not hot the action well .
the centre for public integrity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to make the director again :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of the company should also initi@@ ate a disciplinary procedure against immigration fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company apparently apparently causes adequate legal steps for the application of appropriate functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , re@@ jects this behaviour and consider the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oppos@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ b@@ aza would be a competent type , he would be advis@@ er to be sentenced to prison and half of them .
he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to re@@ integrate into the company that he helped inf@@ ant damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resist@@ ible !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ olin , young Mos@@ ambique and student of the political science in Brazil says , the director is no moral :
Cam@@ b@@ aza is rewarded by the State , because he did not believe it , I can &apos;t believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that has already ins@@ ulted the state .
Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ ality and serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served themselves on the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as a hand@@ shake for an in@@ exhau@@ st@@ ible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was invited and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was such a reward .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t pre@@ fers to remember the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a thief is in prison :
Th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only for ever as the first independent president in memory , but also as a sharp , cut @-@ out and - by the way - proph@@ etic Red@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous depic@@ tions , when he was energetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all to sell his own individual interests , his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tac@@ tic , but he does not change from his amb@@ itions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also declined :
Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he was sitting 10 years old and came free .
and today it is the company , with which he rep@@ ent@@ ailed her , again under the contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ Mitch Shi@@ ps ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , May 12 , 2017

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ pe@@ se or Sp@@ age .

according to the Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the am@@ bush ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) is part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the H@@ ass@@ language in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely ab@@ imp@@ ending con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists than hate speech against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in the efforts to fight H@@ ass@@ in in Myanmar , the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word on itself does not call forth pron@@ unci@@ ation .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that too , in which they have discussed the use of the Word or have doubts as expression of his use , have been cen@@ sored .
moreover , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic meaning that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar ht@@ a@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age @-@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ k@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meaning of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of mine friends was er@@ ased today because he contained the word of Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on the spiritual way of asking whether he could alle@@ vi@@ ate his back pain by doing a word@@ play .
the proposition ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ urt is the opinion that they will reduce H@@ ass@@ le radical nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook can be analytical , before making all the posts sol@@ dering to spread rac@@ ism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tering the word automatically .
automation is not understood what you write on Facebook .
what it should do is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ ages ) .
the good thing is that these tri@@ angular nation@@ alists are spreading a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate language , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the c@@ ens@@ orship is often a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cen@@ sored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described as Facebook began to delete his posts , as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I was alert to this new directive of Facebook , I made a mail to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed .
ir@@ on@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook , and I prohibited the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t correspon@@ d@@ ingly to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative inten@@ tions or simply try to show their opinions against the h@@ ass@@ esses radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed , who has nothing to do with hatred :
post without H@@ ass@@ speech by Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community ask for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work .
such words to zen@@ ge will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
it also appears as if they started this without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry &quot; banned .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to pur@@ ify the fold .
if they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have a great turnover , that would be great .
fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship got worried for a much ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make sure to see the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ not in the context of hatred in order to see if their posts are taken from the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook post@@ ings that no hate language , but still removed :

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch peas and watch a Indian film .
just to try out whether fac@@ ebook has the mail , which contains the word Cal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screenshot , used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their votes and their influence .
among other things , hatred in social networks should also heat violence in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hist@@ s have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out attacks on his bur@@ ial pages under control .
but rather than simply to cut the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have much more current better than concentr@@ ating on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end to children .
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted by the country unanim@@ ously decided to ban this practice , so that the store of the age is now 18 .
prior to this change of marriage , some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj said that the state of the various religious groups of the country were gathered , that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state , since that , age not the maturity . &quot;
this happened un@@ noticed by the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the UN children &apos;s legal convention , the min@@ ors known as , every person under 18 years of age . &quot;
statistics of UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married with 15 already married , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago were 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8,1 percent .
in 2011 , the Statist@@ ical Office of the State confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married since 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online pet@@ itions and social media movements , which were stri@@ ving to abol@@ ish laws on the children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
but not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hindu leader Z. B. hasn &apos;t any concerns about critics of children before they should say they &apos;re dam@@ ned again to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of religious opposition was actually un@@ complicated in this fact , and some doubt came up whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in early 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent being ab@@ stain@@ ed , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must vote and declare the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators published a Status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill against child labour was in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
after being previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media users had been thrilled , because the laws of children were finally changed .
on Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who ar@@ ra@@ yed a minist@@ erial meeting in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk , which has veil@@ ed the core of the thing , but do you know what ? children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s nearly worth every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice was L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; Out@@ standing News !
the spouse has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for that - 0 ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who hears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society which is quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted :
the age @-@ enabled age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the amend@@ ment of the spouse was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties , who were opposed to , have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s before is not permitted by law in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ tur@@ t@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a potential hook is in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hindu organization of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to months , Mahar@@ aj proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to be able to rede@@ em his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , said it was absolutely legitim@@ ate if Mahar@@ aj would go against the law , the most social media users would like that the debate would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the debate so general , in a way that we could respond to the state in our bedrooms , that the state , that it might be of great , hard @-@ minded men who may be mis@@ used to them , would you then be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world , on which the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or still the norm , although there are laws that they are subject to . &quot; &quot; &quot;

by the mirrors of web pages , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , opposed to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally dar@@ kened .
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month , Turkey now blocks the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
the day is clear@@ er , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and rep@@ orters and fans of TV series are defending against the dist@@ ortion .
although many techniques used to use Internet users , re@@ viewing tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , the majority of ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been un@@ locked from Wikipedia , as recently in a published report of Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University have been described since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the most well known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continued to remain locked , several mirrors pages ( pages , which reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator machine links ) which does not make a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult .
however , the content is available despite legal pro@@ hibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after we have heard the messages ( across the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything on the IP@@ FS platform to read snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform so it is possible to read the content on dec@@ entr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.org itself .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step has been carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Crist@@ ian Con@@ son@@ ni by Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy , a mir@@ ror@@ page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors , if in their country Wikipedia is blocked .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Moz@@ illa at the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open &quot; pod@@ cast :
there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a Mir@@ ror .
you attack another URL which is not the original . that &apos;s what you see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia , even if this is locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to get attention to the necessity for nature conservation
a su@@ pr@@ ing rhin@@ oc@@ eros , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ or@@ ly positioned motives and washed colours .
that would motiv@@ ate him to wear a camera in itself , trying to gra@@ ze the situation .
back then he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , N@@ ept@@ une , tries to take on the international stage .
and his hometown directly beside the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which ste@@ er attention to Nep@@ als wildlife .
he described on Facebook as this first class situation helps in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographer ! !
I just rested at home when Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of Rap@@ ti River it would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks to gain a collaboration with the authorities to get worldwide recognition for Nep@@ als Nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding that wild animals are not so terri@@ fying as they look like .
and he should know it , because he stood up Tig@@ ers from face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t distur@@ b itself from the opinion of sheep anymore ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ath appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he immediately takes us , we look at it and he star@@ es me through the Sal trees ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ als Nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it took a tiger to take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near tourist arri@@ vals .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women went to express their hus@@ bands name for the first time

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a Content @-@ Sharing Agreement .
in many parts of India there are women with great care , to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , use a p@@ onom@@ ous or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband due to the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , this practice is alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ vers@@ a by a p@@ seu@@ do@@ v court and to@@ ast by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family .
the tradition of their wives also did not name her name , but is also widespread among men . however , they have much less adher@@ ence to fear if any , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them heal@@ th@@ ers@@ onal as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became a major theme in the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the fin@@ eness of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian countries , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al who is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and embar@@ ked on the degra@@ dation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s homes up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and runs these clubs .
it reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made the wall of the wall .
the first video , which showed the Roh@@ ini in her discussion round , did not act their hus@@ bands in the name of their hus@@ bands .
it has decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak according to their hus@@ bands , is a custom , which they all ple@@ ad guilty and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition test@@ i@@ fies that a wife respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this will be regarded as a cra@@ fty , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never had her husband , had never named her name at home , try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband still weigh long after the video was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I should call him from now on his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the Bag@@ ini , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion lu@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then they asked them all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want us , does that not respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on the lips &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the Bre@@ ad of a century old tradition , in which married women never married the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole practice it was just before him ; another decided to release all the qu@@ anti@@ fied fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush to have broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands on the name .
and they held their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
when her mother in law was an@@ gled , she was afraid , saying that it was a mistake .
another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of participants was less understanding and the situation art@@ ed in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ er point on the forehead , which shows her spouse :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the car@@ cin@@ ating red point if he also did . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laughed only and I listened to it to carry him .
the other women did not cope with it completely , but I think they are now in a better position to choose itself , not to carry him on some days .
for many women , the discussion lu@@ b is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do a trip at every discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
I don &apos;t want to worry about women who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says .
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang , talking about things that they never had thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have made more about some things , for example how our ident@@ ities are linked to our hus@@ bands , never as hon@@ estly spoken .
it feels great to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes .
some women in the group have only used Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a pants , wear ; they have not get@@ ed .
after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own coat choice , mor@@ als connected with the Sar@@ is and much more , bare Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion round so that the women were able to carry them .
next , they now decided to plan to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they can do it .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion lu@@ b has changed a bit , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly moving into the rolls :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have made only little steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then we stopped to say the name of her husband .
some of them included , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women hold on their forehead now at any time .
women in a discussion lu@@ b know that the changes you want to achieve in their lives - like the F@@ eil@@ ing around more movement of movement or their own clos@@ eup - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , it becomes aware that they sit in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman walks in the club and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beatles during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shots from the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on June 29 this year was the h@@ ash@@ tag of the beginning of the year . the H@@ ash@@ tag was seen in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles .
the visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as the revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed the Beatles 1964 in London , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but it was enough to turn the Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here is quite fast , that they were no other choice when the Beatles received open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many known Japanese sizes reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ichi Is@@ aka , president of the single trading Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review .
good morning ! today the Beatles @-@ Ge@@ den@@ kt@@ ag in Japan . at the end of 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs are sung by the Beatles in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in the English classes of Japanese Central schools .
the Beatles of the Beatles survived everything .
today it is Beatles @-@ Ge@@ den@@ kt@@ ag .
we all love the Beatles in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll would represent John Lenn@@ on or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese of course also make pilgri@@ m@@ ages to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band .
indeed , when you love Beatles , you are your 5 places you need to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ m@@ ages can sometimes be in@@ quir@@ ky enough :

exactly in the year 1966 , the Beatles started the first time in Japan .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base as well as commerci@@ alization technical , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here &apos;s Mut@@ ah@@ iro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today , Beatles @-@ Ge@@ den@@ kt@@ ag .

a new system of kidn@@ apping people for organ traff@@ icking , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , is worried by the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the Pra@@ k@@ tik .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the Mil@@ k district , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims has been found , and some of the organs were taken from .
two men were arrested and in the episode they stood , that the bodies of sh@@ am@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi have been used .
there is a local super@@ st@@ ition to dis@@ believe that the head of a man of a man &apos;s gold be@@ fallen or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia declared the BBC .
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks have been registered on glass of men in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of murder for ob@@ sk@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN 2016 to complete a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government campaigns developed to fight these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel in the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique in Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks , warned of the Muslim police after the latest assassination of three bright men because of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assassination were arrested .
Hus@@ um Alg@@ y Adam@@ o , student and residents of the city of In@@ h@@ amb@@ ane said in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sh@@ am@@ ans are involved in the death of the firm men .
the persecution and murder of smooth heads for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a , Province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably super@@ st@@ itious ritu@@ als and is considered by the traditional sh@@ am@@ ans into consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims should have power in their heads power .
in recent days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ ggers arms Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , which pointed out that the problem is part of the bigger social difficulty , facing Mozambique :
I would like to go to GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT I would have to go on the road to go to the road in which the teachers would not viol@@ ate to earn sex against good notes , or even their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; would be driven out to get rid of fast wealth .
despite the appoint@@ ments of phenomena , some of the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ hor@@ rend@@ ition did not escape .

this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ si@@ dents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to international community attention after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed because of liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state dangerous ) after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o , which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called the Li@@ us Case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to have views from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , po@@ ets of Liu X@@ ia , to allow him to permit a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should practice pressure to facilitate Liu in foreign countries .
Norway
Norwegian Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Minister of Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us .
the relationship between China and Norway got into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian Government did not have anything to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the salmon went to China , since the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an un@@ conditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his detention he was not able to increase its price .
during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair .

on 6 July , the European Parliament approved a decision which China was urged to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the top diplom@@ acy of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she was in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all visits who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad divided the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has the possibility to treat abroad , as far as it was in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the Embassy of the Chinese authorities will not only allow Liu to release Liu &apos;s wife , but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the request of U.S. Embassy was a fur@@ ious response from China to itself , with the external Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to inter@@ fere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple following :
protection and freedom such as travel companion and access to medical care of his election on which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal systems and international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to push the Chinese government to push for Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize Lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o thus in a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin that Liu &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
previously diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters reported that China had major concerns whether the vort@@ ex could be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by Liu to Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China asked Liu to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to help himself by his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us Ms. Liu X@@ ia could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact somebody outside , including his lawyers to contact and contact us .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us :
Canada calls on China to preserve its international human rights , including freedom of expression , to preserve and liber@@ ate these rights .
France
the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian reasons on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family may have contact to him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu to the country , the Ministry of Foreign announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Festivals in Taiwan ordered China to release Liu and to show a greater tolerance towards those who demand peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also urged China to allow the sick of intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on 28 June around Liu very worried and gave that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us being well being .
he said about Liu :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my faith that he took and for whom he had taken strictly punished , more harmonious and weal@@ thy China had led to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , who stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Domaine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the conference on the occasion of a meeting on the international association of the State of New York , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ized the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore as they were compared to Singapore with other countries .
it is supported that Singapore should be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is , where most people go a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , we hear that we don &apos;t have any country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities , a bre@@ ach of bre@@ ach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ?
the reasons provided by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of which he appeared inevitably un@@ democratic .
however , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York , both cities lasting from a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re from the author@@ itarian rulers take up the pret@@ ending logic , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , as it fits better to its power .
in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Jewish system truly Non @-@ Ans@@ wers .
he did not tar@@ ry relevant questions with non @-@ Ans@@ wer matters .
Rachel Z@@ eng is calling Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am to illustrate his opinion , because they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit hard to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country is our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very thank@@ ful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take on the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by announ@@ cing his commentary on the blog , it shows on the reviews that you should begin to read the whole tran@@ script of the conference , so that you can understand the context of the statements by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so important , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party in decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the leader of a growing generation , such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very much ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de which I expected - be I agreed with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated with what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SEK Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams Arg@@ uments :
did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ der speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereig@@ n state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereig@@ n rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the government c@@ ops , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious importance .
why do the Singap@@ ur@@ er afford their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
is the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for the affir@@ mation , Singapore is and has always been a town :
&quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot;
this pack seems to have anno@@ yed many of the Singap@@ ure of Singap@@ ure ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not entirely correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flanders .
screenshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked about his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thompson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that comes to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation happens in conversation , it is regarded as polite , interest in his partner , by asking for personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on my clari@@ fications then follows the default answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans cook perhaps even before rage when they are kept for Americans , but doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who does not know , there is little that Canadian is different from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans make a Canadian banner well visible on her backpack when travelling .
all love Canadian .
Americans however ... .
so it was already when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before entering Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadian had always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex E@@ quest@@ s are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is considered to be the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends that I admire very much .
it would not make me anything if you would like to be confused with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc made out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
first , being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to be sp@@ ill , just like the ben@@ evol@@ ent , soft , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( which has an own Canadian double gÃ¤nger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which one can stum@@ ble .
harmless to be , is in@@ consp@@ ic@@ u@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from things that happen around one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , a major union of Canadian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ going as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just a cool polit@@ eness . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we l@@ acks warm heart@@ y , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadian has more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ odi@@ zed Thai Jun@@ ta
one of Thailand &apos;s famous pop @-@ band released a music video that seized the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promises to restore the civilian government , the country still re@@ igns .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his friend about him .
although not expressly political , the music video relates to the persist@@ ing military dom@@ ination of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was allocated 1,@@ 254 times and got 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist urged the public to view this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , as it is the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these photos of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has been pursu@@ ing in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 Rules of the Girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ stic section 44 of the provisional constitution which the commander of the He@@ eres absolute decision indicates important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Create Change &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who viewed from the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose vag@@ ue and clear rules are often used by the authorities to disgu@@ ise activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , supervised the online content and people who accused the monarchy to have le@@ ashed the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thailand puts a strict face against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to buy , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although safety experts were warning that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of control .
in the video , even as people are thrown into a black delivery van , before you bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threat@@ ening long sentences , they should ins@@ ulting the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members showed the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup opponents during the 2014 protests .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri St@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ as@@ ian war officially ended , but its scars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al are showing striking pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mara , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbohydr@@ ate basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
several ethnic groups like Russians , Greeks , siege @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together at Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area .
such sett@@ lements are also called G@@ eister@@ cities in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10.000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in this ghost town .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the 16@@ ,000 people had risen steadily over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a sequence of war &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residence of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ schu@@ k@@ ow@@ ka , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ?
it is still unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and nur@@ ser@@ y schools , which served all the community .
now there is only paved road with bri@@ ghtest splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place lived and their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district meanwhile .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
some 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mara , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which is still one or two families , one recogni@@ zes on the balconies where clothes are dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in your hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our Mother is forbidden to let us take a photo , &quot; one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it &apos;s difficult to come over the rounds .
the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will build extra cour@@ gett@@ es &quot;
some ten years ago , an old woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mara to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left off ab@@ as@@ ies to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid by her daughter , and insist@@ ed that she has supported her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente is just 9 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells that they and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot constantly do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said , we could grow zu@@ cchini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as &apos;s meeting in Nat@@ ascha together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds itself of the village in front of the war .
in spite of the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ asia was simply away ) , they did not have the chance to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children for every child .
her husband works in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house , where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten were once , they hold pigs , cows , rab@@ bits and chickens .
she tells that it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has rather something to do with imp@@ air@@ ments .
after the war there was hardly work and everyone lived as it was right .
I remember every day , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ten@@ ds to the end , a little boy is passing by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flying out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him back .
he plays with the ball , who then rolled down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ ing the ball .
while they run , some of them have stones on the falling buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood , which provide inno@@ c@@ eness in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it different .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; home to their long journey
Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ rosive frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel doesn &apos;t have any charm .
for about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage in the anter@@ oom .
there are no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot;
at present , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept outside on boxes .
she does not want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebast@@ i@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived at a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebast@@ i@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yoghurt @-@ be@@ ard ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replies with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her , since African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebast@@ i@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they have lived in Brazil , however it is for some African , who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other way@@ men of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often traveling together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ App from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companion Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker at the sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy has been weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bu@@ ggy to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
it explains that their Christian faith is the imp@@ etus of their labour .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hoping for migrants who travel through tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their small house .
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the bu@@ sti@@ ets are sold too expensive for many African immigrants .
he has begun to help them a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans .
some sleep on blan@@ kets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ book outside .
Valen@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he told . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was rejected by the United States after a raid on his work place .
the majority of migrants that travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their houses for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez told me that he fled to Honduras , with his wife and three children , who wanted to ex@@ er@@ ate money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , one single one , has offered him its roof .
a few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the courses , travelers quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nost@@ al@@ gic , because of those who went away .
like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there are one of her daughter with African hair , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many trav@@ ellers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she introduces me shortly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ eron , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; they have gone already . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their cell phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users ,
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in West China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their cell phones .
on 10 July , the mobile users of the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification in which it points to the district government , a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hin@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app just after they had replaced the app with a private We@@ chat group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the press release of the police , the app will determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs web page describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users attentive to how much time they are spending online and to remot@@ ely control the own home network .
this app for min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers can manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while talking about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , th@@ ron@@ ged ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , authorities often arrange extreme c@@ ens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ aking Internet shut@@ downs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from Great Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cen@@ sored messages published in China showed photos of a check@@ point where the polic@@ emen checked the residents if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification is demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of cap@@ tive by rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Great Britain &quot; ( pist@@ ol . ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password claim to a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard disk .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell@@ phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang are connected to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang might be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the dis@@ semin@@ ation of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and with the party related institutions , including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the orders of the Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , a US @-@ American Human Rights Organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a Regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a Regulation on all the residents and entrepren@@ eurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the intention is obviously &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrorist videos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to identify and destroy this action , however , the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible dis@@ ables , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cry out after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the row &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagine that you &apos;re all alone at a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually revealed itself and revealed to truth , which is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one who makes all glory to her name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality goes back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the perform@@ ers - turn the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es to death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts arise in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth re@@ side down on the axis of the disaster . you will realise that you have caught between the walls and your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security services it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he introduced his power over us , by destroying even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew .
five yo@@ ungst@@ ers were torn off during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to cut the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ in@@ ingly , to the wrong time , even if I had no high demands to a city that is up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a bit of reli@@ eved after the power supply began to work in the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by crying out several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we bund@@ led us to a magnificent picture , which my expectations full and fully fulfilled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you get the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make you ready to meet us at the Military Security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give your voice back to you to the office of the security service from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father had already been there , as I was now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry , if we are not nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ ind@@ ly eyes were set up on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sorry what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so confident when I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; he puts it in sol@@ itary and his father with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is up to today in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an epic torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am scre@@ aming the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
thereafter again through the courtyard and in the second office , which leads through a gang to the individual cells .
I character@@ ise all details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have given me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner and must put me immediately , without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell , and I grab@@ bed a long @-@ tried communication method : to strike your f@@ ist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew my cell @-@ coat was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black@@ ness &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finally answered me after a long time .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a well @-@ kept man of middle ages , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the Doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness no distinctive facial features can be recognized , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all only numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was laid in one of the great cells .
maybe he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would be free when I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , lab@@ elled by the fruit in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ aming .
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the Sch@@ re@@ ie sounds , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the hor@@ ror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; En@@ try on the 13th s@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; they are here to listen . &quot;
thus the secret was led to protect and prevent the sovereig@@ n safety in front of us , that we release the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ical dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ ve@@ al black@@ out map and locked the close eye view of their world view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse which they call Ko@@ exist@@ enz to transform the crime of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I supervised the listening room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can join so much important thing with your life when you join this day and to protest to demonstrations , which will soon be an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;m acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , not to answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say exactly when ins@@ ults and blo@@ ws have become a friendly interview for me to a common communication tool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened , was un@@ important .
some voice in me told me that I had to get used to be punished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to plu@@ ck me so much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; conf@@ ession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with him , and you can &apos;t stop your shame .
my sciss@@ ors still didn &apos;t miss him enough , so it was out of the tube by a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a garbage collector or if it belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had flo@@ cked four cables in order to present great invention of a giant cab@@ bage out of their point of view .
three of them changed within one hour , while I was still in the row .
I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I stopped crying out .
the hen noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t care about it , why it is next to an electric charged rod .
electricity pier@@ ced my whole body , enough to store my entire area .
my half @-@ out body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect power conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed me , which came to me as minutes .
then the appeal to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room &apos; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhau@@ sting youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet , and walk you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ent@@ ails the majority of his time inside ; let him kill in his canvas , times to his computer , and again also to his couch .
what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or with nic@@ ot@@ ine spots to discover .
he lives in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as a fel@@ ony ( about : farmer ) .
for more than six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist that joins the conservative majority and asked about gender equality , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian geography , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics will not only be found in his hometown , Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities which from Damascus is rich in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits , and he can bring with their own testimony to the people who suffer from the devast@@ ating consequences of foreign inter@@ ventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even though he is not open to US foreign policy , he dis@@ moun@@ ts a special inc@@ lin@@ ation against the US foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b believes not that his compassion for those who try to do something with his identity as &quot; Palestinian &quot; wing@@ ed of the second generation , &quot; he called himself even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own living conditions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he is dissolved in water in two cups , it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; at that time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for them to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ nap @-@ warm coffee and s@@ quad@@ rons of the K@@ ent C@@ igar@@ ette speak mainly in the nose into the first line of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when one throws a look into the neighboring countries .
therefore , you simply avo@@ ids to do basic things - as in public during the Ram@@ adan water - to not land in jail .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a gig of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a , for the second time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some par@@ liament@@ arians , who support the Islamic action front - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contra@@ di@@ ct the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country and the main reason for the concert is said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the member and former press director of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many claim also , the commitment of the band in matters of Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m that constitutes the ancient legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es throughout the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eil@@ a estimates the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive supp@@ orter of human rights , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which still has decided to use an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is probably not easy to be fl@@ atter@@ ing rh@@ etor@@ ic , but indeed an increasingly clear reality in Jordan , which is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b joined traditional gender standards by bringing his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a evi@@ den@@ ced unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ mor@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honour of honour in 2016 reached its cul@@ mination ; however , the institutional infrastructure is still missing in order to support women who attempted murder , or domestic violence , in an appropriate way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law for inter@@ ru@@ ction from the year 1954 , women may be exposed to famili@@ al violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at in@@ definite time in prison &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and for her release is often a years of bureau@@ cr@@ atic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman will not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it , also not shy of topics that are long as tab@@ oos in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but he cle@@ ans his music , which is full of explic@@ it announ@@ c@@ ements on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
he became ob@@ sol@@ ete in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs , which are politically politically , can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated :
you are free , and any other is also . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that one can get , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ id or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noticed that there are hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya to mem@@ or@@ ise his comments from the context , twi@@ sted and his opinion were cen@@ sored .
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b advert@@ ises the Arabic LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance of homosexu@@ als does not pron@@ ounce Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what was supposed to work later on behalf of the Cali@@ ph in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do this not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , don &apos;t have anything with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eil@@ a or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ itic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service filed several former government officials and members of the teaching association , with the grounds that they would have critical to problems in social media , associated with the deeply rooted in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is therefore only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ians .
for him , progress is a permanent give and take . Jordan has denied a show for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks slower , thanks and intern@@ alised changes . he is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
finally , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dre@@ amt about as millions of other Arabs , also from an Arab world without inter@@ ventions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is not only dre@@ aming of his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is paraly@@ sed by music , art and literature of real and fundamental op@@ enness - and not by bombs , stre@@ um@@ und@@ itions and artificial nature . at least he hopes that .
until it is far , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue and thus resist resistance .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , the A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant war dolls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory has been handed over and from one time to date , in the armies of Japan invaded the northeast , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I &apos;ve been watching the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two vehicles are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high car was amazing .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were external appearance and body care so important as in this story , because they help maintain the Peruvian youth from crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ eurs .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where road smo@@ b and illegal drug traff@@ icking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for men &apos;s aesthetic services .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ esis ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in becoming more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers that can recre@@ ate these sophisticated hair@@ styles .
the un@@ preced@@ ented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity , has even an annual event inspired to match the hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there experts will compete against each other in order to show , who can see the ec@@ centric l@@ ooks that you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests can be found on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located here in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share young people on hair tools and to get their weapons against hair@@ dresser , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the bi@@ d@@ elling possibilities , dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialist in the municipality and the district , what we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letter to Guer@@ ill@@ ac@@ fighters
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
the following article is the modified version of the contribution &quot; love messages to Guer@@ ill@@ ac@@ fighters , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this post is published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important , people who feel out to bring with affection ?
this question was not exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Crist@@ ian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young Youth Foundation ( letters to reconc@@ iling ) to encourage young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
recently , her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian Government signed a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
International was the signing of the peace treaty as significant , that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
colum@@ bi@@ ans , however , is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ ill@@ ac@@ fighters who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to war rh@@ etor@@ ic and around the clock , they have to integrate them back into life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , must now record them in their ranks and support them when setting up a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that young colum@@ bi@@ ans would have to join together and would have to help the integration process .
and exactly that they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love sponsor@@ ships at former gu@@ err@@ illa fights to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa ste@@ amer - who are to be personally handed over .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Campaign
the idea for reconciliation was produced at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize for the Nobel Peace Prize in February 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this explained that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent popularity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the F@@ ARC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is prepared to make a dis@@ course of war history to a common history of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive anybody .
the first 500 letters were handed over to the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ iana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city council of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bog@@ ot@@ art traveled to the camp to provide the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC set up as they had done earlier in order to oppos@@ e the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of under@@ taking of people from all over the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a very moving moment for all those involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies in between &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience so :
having passed the letters , a former fighter carried me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bus@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa war ) saw I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa , who wrote something .
I was afraid to go into , for besides him there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ cher , a deadly weapon in the sleeping sleep .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
never in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . suddenly the tears ran across the che@@ eks .
I embra@@ ced him completely , and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer .
perhaps he was sorry to war , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion to this fighting , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life as war . the F@@ ARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together with a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as war , and the F@@ ARC already existed in secret .
therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have we experienced how the social in@@ justice of the State on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country fair@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to overcome this magn@@ itude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
those people who have never found hearing had never heard and had no election right , and to recognize that people often have learned as monsters , and even hate people with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality , where the country lives , hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed , have done so much harm to us , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
colum@@ bi@@ an@@ ians had been proph@@ es@@ ied that after dis@@ arm@@ ament peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as it gives ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ide@@ ology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from your own experience that nothing is simple . among us who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are coming .
there will be many obstacles on our path , but we will overcome them together .
a trans@@ lady talks about the persecu@@ tions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life from Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article that was written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ sum@@ owa and his first publication on the website OC Media .
homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ ror , activists over the last few months had experienced the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the situation of the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only about the night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines after several months , after reports published the tow@@ ing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; it threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took men suspic@@ ious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ lady , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when they grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which was why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced by the gender equality of their country@@ woman , the hunting was opened to Sabrina .
from fear for her life she moved to the USA last grand@@ son .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day , someone told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a trans@@ lady who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , he was a friend , a copy of my documents , and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . so , he sent them no more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by all W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just doing a few grocery bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a voice @-@ voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a set , but this time at Che@@ et@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honour the family still , you cry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up the final end of the hospital .
apparently , some women had taken everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man was bra@@ i@@ ded .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ching in my right lung wings .
OC Media : in which medical wings you laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for that I am very grateful .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ cas@@ ian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him that he has been respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , stranger , some totally unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
the requested to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I had to prove it out through the streets ; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in the official TV that I had not changed my sex , and Photoshop .
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some older people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world , which has not only ashamed of your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put on a kn@@ itting around the neck .
fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dar@@ kened window plates and a plate plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how are you bra@@ i@@ ded ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I will not give up their name , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something terrible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registration without me , without notice , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know already in which hotel you are in . you know even your room number .
only to prove it : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was really my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality . however , it is a table issue .
some traditionally @-@ Cau@@ cas@@ ian elements still carry in me .
so much I would like to overcome this exotic barrier I can &apos;t overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
if we chat with camera , I give me some effort to look like the person to remember them from their past - so on my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what are your friends , those who stayed d@@ ord@@ ed ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for this I needed current information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had spent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that Ram@@ adan was not arrested and tor@@ tured in Ram@@ adan , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so I think they probably download the relative , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end request a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been experienced by blood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : will there be men more gay guys in these secret pris@@ ons now ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says it wouldn &apos;t be so many .
if , above all , those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives to meet Kad@@ y@@ rows Court .
as far as I know , they are kept there to present them later as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , they have targeted specifically to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this only a mut@@ ation or have you a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just cited someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have gone in this prison , after that it had grown be@@ ard .
there was nothing new since then .
they simply took them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was with himself when these men were taken away .
until now , they were not introduced as band@@ its , but there were no reports before . however , we susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible .
why else could one not allow this man to shave himself ?
do you know if these persecu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who hear a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always wore my hair ever long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , before 2003 , I was already familiar with quite big , when I lived there - and I never had problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is that possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were kno@@ cked ; I had coloured eyelashes , bore tubes and short tops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security ministry of the Sh@@ aria never touched me only a hair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never ins@@ ulted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; repro@@ ach is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children , when they make fun of sick .
OC Media : so they simply have closed their eyes before you , because they believed they are sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never ins@@ ulted me , never ch@@ ased , and never beaten me .
OC Media : how long did this grace stay ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov appeared on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began speaking to talk about mor@@ als on TV .
he did not speak about us , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had laughed and laughed at once , viewed you at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the republic constantly wor@@ sen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I beg@@ ged them to the hospital and help them to get food types .
I have no cents for this .
I discovered that people themselves , when I breath@@ ed random .
I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that is al@@ ig@@ ning .
this is the nature , which has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who knows you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no co@@ ils with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ in@@ ers who have the Russians too ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant to me to hear .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and together during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of tran@@ si@@ veness to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise , different habitats .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to harm me for my body .
do not know if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now .
local groups war@@ n an increase of suicide within the pover@@ ished Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran
the Iranian pedi@@ atri@@ z region suff@@ ers from an un@@ usually high unemployment reduction and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there is a strong increase of suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the suicide of a man called Jas@@ sim Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran , influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ ight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness to come up for his family , such as Ah@@ mad human rights violations who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous .
on YouTube , a video sent on YouTube , after he had lit himself for himself .
some people quickly made it to er@@ ase the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly after a short time .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab ancest@@ or minority , and activists from the village , that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Ham@@ id manipul@@ ate , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im have listened to .
their stories have a thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the basis of the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of doing their families .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a majority of Iran living in Iran , has been devast@@ ated by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power in 1925 and took great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the tou@@ gh@@ est areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and prevention .
the Iranian regime denied the gene@@ alog@@ ical stations systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government has also built a multitude of dem@@ on , the water of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying .
these dam@@ s have only managed to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director of Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social @-@ Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who have completed a job , completed the primary school , 55 % have completed a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian gene@@ alog@@ ist activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high rise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of suicide among young gene@@ alog@@ y men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Doh@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab labour forces , the local Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi will have access to work opportunities in all sectors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the prev@@ ailing regime that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and earn them to earn their li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are people who had to change their ancest@@ or and sur@@ names to hide their belonging to the ancest@@ or , as even Arabian names are not toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speech of Arabic language or the fru@@ ition of Arabic clothing .
given the given circumstances , whom the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , strike the human rights activists before the situation explo@@ sives .
it remains to wait if the world guards and assumes knowledge .

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide back and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions , in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ ular femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put a well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women still earn less money in spite of the same education than men .
that women still stand still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with her body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women so@@ oner or later in various areas of life to a glass covering , and that discrimination based on sex is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of it and I am double and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I have to speak on skin color on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention that kind of physical , se@@ el@@ ic and verbal abuse have been ab@@ used , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , there were many white femin@@ ists to keep silent femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women - all women - to come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift up their voices and &apos; K@@ umb@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are subjected to black women to two times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or about that black women and women from other eth@@ nic@@ ities and their future will earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that black girl and girls with a migration background are often referred to as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spher@@ es and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want all men , all men and all men in any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman who is ref@@ using to consider un@@ just in@@ just@@ ices in their thinking that relate to gender as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m exhausted and will not fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist orient@@ ated sphere that repeatedly refused me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner answered in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ide@@ ology in which the black woman is in historical regard a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ref@@ uses to join group@@ ings , who will also absorb our customs and customs , in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ ent@@ ric program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will no longer try to grow white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the meaning of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ ular femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women different information a home and down from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I draw near to rele@@ asing me full and completely of femin@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we define black women according to our own ideas and created us into the spher@@ es that are created for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana bl@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves ) , in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be admired which represent the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists immediately call Separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in a environment in which my life is neither out@@ passed nor ignored , nor denied .
p@@ addle against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations

in this documentary by Emily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the effect of pollution in its community .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river , which we lost when I was still a child , &quot; he told Mus@@ a .

&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Paraguay women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ ality in the country and in the region to express their re@@ jection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cour@@ ier . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # br@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ar@@ bin ) which reports on the force of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect people affected .
a police commission@@ er said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her husband , who had become violent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of its relationship has passed some time and the police said , her statement would be laid to the files , but you could not do more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed , because of the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez is also nothing useful .
a few days later , the second woman returned their ad .
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women will see once again , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on the men who mis@@ use them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who have to admit to be victims of violence at all .
In@@ struc@@ 1 pun@@ ches and Statist@@ ik@@ en@@ 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that do not inter@@ fer@@ t@@ 3 yr@@ ays laws : good approach , defective implementation impacts and statistics
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to see how many women really are har@@ assed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various details and reports that , however , will not even accum@@ ulate the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the At@@ tor@@ ney General of 9@@ 600 ads went over for domestic violence . with 70 % of them it went to violence against women .
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence with peace of peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mis@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
however , these statistics not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi will actually show only a few of these crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who will be reimbur@@ sed because of physical failure , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay has no own criminal off@@ ences , criminal prosecution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented as many women were murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence affected by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that doesn &apos;t inter@@ fere .
before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the name of all of her former friends .
at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do it , but she was supposed to repent .
today , Mariana is 28 years old and not more with Carlos . but for two years she carried the psych@@ ic violence on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time clearly recogni@@ zable :
I never thought I would have been victims of abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women have happened to be di@@ ven@@ ed because they can be deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he isolated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people responded to their contributions , among them also Carlos himself . he asked the rh@@ etor@@ ical , whether he had ever collected his hand against it and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mist@@ re@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave it earlier .
it almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria Santos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner she joined them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) which consists of women that are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not : they take the testimony of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her weal@@ thy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as displays the authorities without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she led a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ perme@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly used for money , power , and influence of its former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paraguay : good approach , defective implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ad of abuse is a way full of resist@@ ors and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria Santos .
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , a draft bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ E@@ lla ( # FÃ¼r@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ in@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law sees to explain to an independent alleged off@@ ense and to pun@@ ish tou@@ g@@ her as already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points to also hold the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law that therefore may be denied that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which is currently forbidden in Paraguay , and can be punished by up to five years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill had fore@@ seen the majority of the ( bureau@@ cr@@ atic and economic ) travel costs which have to carry out the victims of violence in themselves , if they just want to report to impos@@ e a secure accommodation .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , failure is considered as part of human relationships .
a change must take place here , that violence is no longer considered a little bit too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is silent about these facts , makes it guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators come away . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must reimbur@@ se as long ad@@ vert , no more than normal does not apply .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ian Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage has been kn@@ itted against reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after pro@@ hibition of newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed on account of a decision by the Ministry of Information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the Norwegian authorities closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sult@@ an@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he became a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ s Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , but came back later .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us ib@@ n S@@ aid , who came to power since 1970 , after he had set his father , S@@ aid ib@@ n Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , chief commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the dom@@ ination of the sult@@ ans is characterised by the persist@@ ed efforts of security forces , especially of domestic fre@@ edoms , including public fre@@ edoms , including press freedom , exter@@ mination and human rights , independent journalists , blo@@ gger and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and activists who have their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , their closure and the arrest of three of their editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its foundation in 2007 , over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces seized Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , after having appeared in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; High @-@ level Parties to hands of Justice . &quot; this was about corruption in judicial authorities and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report government officials were accused of raising judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bound hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the ISS before the Special Department and was arrested at his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS adopted the Deputy Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had taken place after Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ aris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the information ministers had given the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and dis@@ semin@@ ation of the newspaper on any way including online , from 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial was held in Mas@@ kat the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the court sentenced three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of the inter@@ ruption of public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; and &quot; sub@@ excav@@ ation of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3,000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , one year @-@ year employment was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 R@@ ial ( 2,@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network for spreading material that could represent a danger for public order . &quot;
the Al @-@ Abr@@ i was set for a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic R@@ ial ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 in prison sentence of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also lifted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
in spite of the decision of Jud@@ gment , Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s decision , the newspaper looks suspended from attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on 8 January the Minister of Information issued a directive that was extended by the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister ordered a further time against the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman was injured in Oman .
further injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to hire their operation .
because of the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ bian authorities are still not prepared to make an end to the extensive bre@@ ach of press freedom .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the om@@ anic authorities :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
2 . a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper to create their journalists in their work ;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , human rights , and journalists in Oman ensure their legal human rights un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of reli@@ ance measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans .

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure will take place with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media . these are a growing area addressed to the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the required medical research on site . there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the particular medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have become far more serious in the p@@ oo@@ rest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and missing investments for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical industry .
second , research which is carried out by African scientists itself is helping to develop their own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ecti@@ ous diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ecti@@ ous Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first grave impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself for@@ ged the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as private owner ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research subject ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we just put solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
that must change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being called .
the solutions that we get are often not applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
RW : basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special science education starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit .
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often they are limited speed , things to do , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;

but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not use them for bre@@ eders .
the patents are not only for individual types , but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases , a special red@@ - or green , or cro@@ oked leaves .
over the past few years , more such patents have been filed for more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environmental protection and expert food safety concerns the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on is still salad , but now he needs longer , since his work is becoming increasingly difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der would lie in a river , so that I have to d@@ ump@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents are going to go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand still in court , no one can breed a new salad , because all the features are patented . &quot; he &apos;s so good as possible and tries to explo@@ it those features that he wants .
however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and ende@@ avo@@ red to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also joined a movement which is becoming ever greater in the U.S. and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated red skirts of the variety of Out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there we have been tested if plants grown in space .

it is no co@@ incidence that this name sounds rather as it sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to protected software .
it was established in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plants permanently .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. bre@@ eders are able to undertake that others can freely use the seed @-@ free seed .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; -@@ bre@@ eders allow their seed to cross it so own varieties , and it cannot be used immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents .
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the Emer@@ itus Professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and Os@@ si management board , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and for environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in greater mer@@ ges such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter or only little by using natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with gene@@ tically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , gene@@ tically modified or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve our aim of ecological sustainability , it is necessary to know how it is offered on farms in August and September 2016 , should also know the way that this vegetables is bred , such as this vegetables is bred . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nutrition security without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative committed themselves to keep others their seed freely available . in contrast , its approach can be patented in contrast , seed and plant features .

Os@@ si Supp@@ orters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk , since the available gene pool due to the always abundant intellectual property rights to plant material , which thus is always restricted , un@@ stopp@@ able .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , employed in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability . she found out that approximately one @-@ third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it not only useful for plant bre@@ eders .
for other plants there are not such estimates , but experts such as Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aged crops such as wheat in even bigger style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots .
a question of view
plants are so far@@ med that they exhibit specific traits - from such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such as they prosp@@ er in certain environments and keeping threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders are increasing by ever more patents . however , genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever worse .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto &apos;s spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowledge that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto &apos;s activities . with a total of four comra@@ des and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States , the company is committed to conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she contra@@ dic@@ ts to restri@@ ct intellectual property other bre@@ eders , da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant variant innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent has exp@@ ired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
such protection is not in@@ hib@@ its innovation , but encourages them to be provided by public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
Mort@@ on sees it different : 20 years for waiting until a patent is silent , but certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions , you might have lost the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should continue to remain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible to us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
altogether Mort@@ on is inter@@ cep@@ tible on the concept to pat@@ rol plant features : &quot; we do not really create features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bre@@ eders , we don &apos;t have any idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Os@@ si management board , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who cultiv@@ ate a variety , will chast@@ ise its own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for cultiv@@ ating Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de cultiv@@ ators in its varieties of farming .
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Monsanto are moving on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents make it possible to survive the most smaller seed companies as well as without patents , or keep it for too expensive and therefore don &apos;t be re@@ warding or both are the case .
the independent plant owner Frank Mort@@ on seeks out in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would continue by A@@ void of plant patented innovative : &quot; it looks like I can produce new efforts to produce new things more powerful than businesses .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years itself , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is 20 years ago protected from competition , so that my opinion is quite simple . &quot; worldwide resonance
&quot; &quot; &quot; although the U.S. seem to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; which describes itself as professional organization in the area of resources , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization is based on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , essential for the Os@@ si commitment to be just one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declar@@ es that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conventional cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is aimed at governments of the Member States , the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seeds and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems declar@@ es that the organization is currently planning a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for the scheduled next year of the official start .
a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the action group for ero@@ sion , technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , is published by the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - a report . it represents the view that farmers will have the opportunity to move seeds and improve seed policies to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also emphas@@ izes the importance of a diverse , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems - a connection with the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will see him soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods , especially as it is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now try to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still Lock the Egyptian authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contents &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
on the weekend around the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ized this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities in order to defend the freedom of freedom and human rights in this part of the world , even if it has never been so difficult to overcome the freedom of freedom and rights in this part of the world , in order to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome the locking and not re@@ ins@@ ing . we ins@@ ist on our task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of web@@ side barrier to the victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ O@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access in Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semin@@ ation of columns and articles that he does not write to websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cen@@ sored system of the Egyptian government , itself is the aim of an attack .
Blo@@ gger , who is also home to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student prot@@ ectors and recorded a video as the police exerc@@ ised physical violence against two students .
his article mainly turn policy and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the dist@@ ortion caused by the government and reflected what this means to him :
that , blogs too is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded to conv@@ ey the feeling of an ins@@ ulating state ; an arrest , an attempted murder , pre @-@ loading of the National Security Council , the lock blogs , and any other web site , for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I wasn &apos;t in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a little audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
at first I took it to the post of articles to avoid the c@@ ens@@ orship .
now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06 . August 133 pages . this showed technical tests in networking various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of suppliers through the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing possible , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block contents and fil@@ tering users that have access to Egyptian users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed that the cen@@ sored decisions are taken behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by which it can proceed to court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day for day newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines made from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city of the country and home of numerous postcard images .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; Every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rob@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8@@ 500 soldiers from the army , marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in an an@@ gled financial situation , the force of 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports such as these are daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 16th August , the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they arrived , a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the newspaper so :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual abuse , etc . everything , however , will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative to conclude our eyes as journalists in front of cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the chief editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist who explains it according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which are controlled by criminal organizations .
in the Editorial , the newspaper writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deliber@@ ately think that a war rate will be dist@@ orted , even if it can be used to susp@@ end atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argue against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a just@@ ification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account@@ ability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as extra demonstrated in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investments in personnel , clari@@ fication , and historical and sel@@ f@@ eit@@ ing negle@@ ct of the public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just his capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Rio de Janeiro , as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is false : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil are at the north and nor@@ theastern part of the country . this is the most recent available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes .
the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , is owned by Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the security policy of the country for years .
the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Pac@@ if@@ ic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of Rio in 2003 , belonged to the establishment of a massive police offering a fav@@ ela and permanently station@@ ed one unit permanently .
at the beginning , this led to a decline of non @-@ violent deaths . since a few years , the U@@ PP was responsible for lack of ch@@ ic@@ ans and re@@ pression against the poor mun@@ icipalities that the newly created police unit should actually protect , increasingly under decision .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles from the year 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also draws serious consequences for the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls on the state to create means of war and paths , which are typical of a war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and to the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ oned balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of fav@@ elas will continue to suffer .
one week , it is now that the police crossed the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to s@@ lash the death of a polic@@ emen .
in the midst of all these violence , this incident was also head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of a kiss that fired the police from a helicopter .

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ lib currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly strong , where an attack with chemical weapons called for hundreds of civilians on 21 August 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition emerged , based on investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2013 , these areas have been controlled by rebels under siege under siege , which led to local residents to be found on local or through tun@@ nels and control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the years of block@@ age , traditional foods have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they call themselves in Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and bring the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
they do not belong to the traditional food , in Syria , and are only very rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive dietary source for many residents of the besie@@ ged Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a .
the board of the project , subscription , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultiv@@ ate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cell@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eil@@ a , one of the organizers , reports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Global Vo@@ ices that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been fighting this project for three years , and pressed his relief to win more and more &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use the humanitarian Crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge for plant@@ ing fungi , as Dr. L@@ eil@@ a to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article they reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 euros , but will continue until Monday , 04 September 2017 , continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 Â° C and the humidity of 80 % .
due to fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. L@@ eil@@ a said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of the mushrooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded they used a bigger tub . and so on .
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the start of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over East Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. L@@ eil@@ a declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people of pilgrims for different reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bre@@ ach of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
dis@@ semin@@ ation of a culture of self @-@ care by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee making , box , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities , which are bound to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ed on 21 October in many districts in Portugal and for the victims of the fires that occurred in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government killed last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and many villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande there was a similar tragedy , where it was caused by the fires 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forestry surveillance system , which is monitored by satellite photos alone in 2017 , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread across the net and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the Se@@ able tragedy
the aim of protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ ventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection could not be able to com@@ fy the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al , by the covenant of the farmers of Portugal , the newspaper p@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o explained :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
they did not do this Sunday : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy , as in June , could happen again , as the roads were blocked very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko are questioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far reaching proposal on the forest @-@ form , which had brought the government to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was requ@@ is@@ iti@@ oned by the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led to a loos@@ ening of the case , if the applic@@ ant had means of means of suicide - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val continued in the same article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Environment Organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly flamm@@ able wood , spread like in a devil , according to Br@@ ings of this type .
to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when residents sought information or tried to contact relatives , offline .
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data using the f@@ og@@ os.@@ pt application and informed the population in real time via the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina , in order to simpli@@ fy the work of fire brig@@ ade and was thus announced that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who pursued the fires , not stand@@ alone : the site counted more than half a million requests .

the way from the refugee from Afghanistan to successful entrepren@@ eurs
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati and his friend and colleague Yas@@ in in Venice .

during a night in the autumn of 1994 , the Taliban started Afghanistan by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the different Mu@@ jah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings , who had conquered the short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan has become a country of terror and desp@@ air .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central African , for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t tell her then , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his uncle would fet@@ ch him and bring him to the tow .

CC @-@ 2.0
Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by the Taliban , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly s@@ uns@@ aved .
the Taliban known for their hatred at Haz@@ ara &apos;s known Taliban ever came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hes@@ itation . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took that which was left of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and drag@@ ged bags with mort@@ ars , which were harder than he himself to earn his living .
back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site we worked on .
there was no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t spare at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and ran on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago , A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of food to needy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system suff@@ ers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special entrance centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a admission center , if they officially have a request for asylum , which can go down for months after the registration of the asylum seek@@ er .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for an accommodation , rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so there will be A@@ shar@@ k .
but his innocent life helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
after spending several years in construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k set his total savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this was so good that he opened a second hostel for a while and a fast meal .

the conditions for entrepren@@ eurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italian - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high tax and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afghan people live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transition solution to other European countries .
over the past few years , some Afghan companies , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff were mainly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells about the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy .
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp in Pad@@ ua ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na Pizzeria in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far beyond the Italian food industry and retail , and aim to the country that it forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily , if I know my people suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the p@@ oo@@ rest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same ways as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can promote packaging and con@@ serv@@ at@@ isation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their efforts on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development for the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through in@@ security and doubt , but at the end stability and prosperity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afghan people on this path . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ne@@ ti@@ zen report : legislation from Egypt allow power off social networks Mah@@ moud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody .
he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which protest@@ ed against President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen report is an international snap@@ shot that shows challenges , victories , and upcoming trends in global Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament is verified that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users would need to use social networks to be able to use social networks , within six months after the successful bill of law on the website of the authority under indication of its full name and identity number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; penalty of penalty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was recru@@ ited by six@@ ty members of Parliament , is currently under legislative and the parliamentary committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; May another MP grants a legislative proposal to be introduced in the harder pen@@ alties for the President or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the siege of the President and state institutions are already stra@@ ight@@ forward . however , under the law , such a deed would act with prison and money @-@ pun@@ ishments , as right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , this would sign a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom is in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud subscription Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on August 13 , 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian police officers , demonstr@@ ating violence against the military put@@ sch , which led to the president of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in detention at a court date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed on 20 May , because the prison line led to the human rights of human rights , to bring the def@@ endants from prison to the court@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree on a placebo of among other weapons , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza spoke two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged with their coverage at the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested during the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunis@@ ian activists listen to mess@@ ed documents
in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ b of Sami Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been li@@ stens to a negoti@@ ated action plan mainly by the President of the Republic , the business@@ man and during the former regime was endor@@ sed by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of official am@@ nesty .
the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , throws a light on how to look forward to the prefer@@ ential plans to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused the nam@@ ing of its sources by Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press @-@ complex , which journalists protects the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless he joined the Tunis District Court on May 09 as a witness in the case .
will China force social media users to present their ID ?
according to new rules at the State of State of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need to write permission to write messages in social media .
in addition , the rules will also be specified that the registration will be required with the full real name .
anal@@ ysts believe that the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments will be achieved in discussions within social networks . it is un@@ clear until now , how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed that regulations are only sel@@ ective in social media to protect citizens from journ@@ alism and independence .
then see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register in the state government as an &quot; organizer of information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government provides a list of online services which provides the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to make use of contents responsible for removing content and for@@ cing them on request for removing users . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ classic ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish Court dispos@@ es Sper@@ m Wikipedi@@ as
a Turkish court had the locking Wikipedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to delete two English articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime Affairs and Communication have been closed because it has been merged to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source that works with groups to tackle a political re@@ am@@ ination campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , besides that China , one of the few countries worldwide , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
Britain can &apos;t stop , h@@ itting sn@@ ug@@ gle up
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week of continuous documents the government of Britain is in the midst of an increased monitoring of surveillance , the Internet service providers would force to install communications in real @-@ time and to install Backdoor programs to encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has cons@@ ulted telecommun@@ ications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consultation will continue until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior .
