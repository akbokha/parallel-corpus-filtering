<seg id="1">Although I visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I also grew up with American movies, danced to American music and operated by American writers.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the Grand Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to occupy the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with judges who were inquired of his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "freely to Method Man," "" "I was it as if that's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "I said," "" "America is the only country in which I ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish letter of love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most unusual aspect of his ascension is for me, how he moves with his engines.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have reacted to their statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won with republican elections, was the highest number ever achieved by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigker person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people that I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, the people from all over the world, a deep believer man, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">In addition, Trumps did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met in our shared love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trump Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr who fights for her life for the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with patience and grace and helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise Council helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people, and they embodied by them, deepened my love in America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump gave his way to the republican Presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the opposite of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The struggle with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they either shared racism and fanaticism, because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it's unfair to designate the Trump-voters as a breed.</seg>
<seg id="34">One of my friends, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in another way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most know are, for trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commits the cruel decision to raise a man who looks like contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(4 m.):" "" "white to the White and whiplash" "". "word play from white in recording to the white and whiplash, as it called the big Van Jones, exactly that which America made so magnificent." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background you may always have, America is called everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyman whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "with the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise, saying," "" "Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"" "" "" "Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "" "asked Mr. Khan." ""</seg>

<seg id="53">"no!" they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone who isn't like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="59">The land which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could find no place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican musical school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">The music that is played on both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212, an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists, but worlds from the nearby splendid ruins and its world famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a couple of years now the La Banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra composed of children and adults, which with their musical instruments a way to overcome them surrounding poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero has become the central interest in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community that is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos is known for their drugs abuse and gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project, and the youth so offered a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments against the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI means:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and play with shiny eyes and play in the action you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7.000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments which are made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with re-prepared instruments that consist of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycler had begun to turn parts of waste in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, viola, Celli, double basses, guitars, flutes, trumpets, trumpets, trombones and percussion which all were made from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as the music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local eco-ologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today, there is a whole orchestra which plays on the instruments made of recycled material and the The Recycled Orchestra is called.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance on:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year the world produces approximately one billion metric tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the troubles - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that describes targeted solutions for environmental problems.</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already run illegal fishing waters before it explored the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">"" "" "" "the East African countries were brought upward and inclined to welcome a criminal law of this type on their coasts." ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comore, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized themselves rapidly against the ship. they refused to carry out one of their harbours and refused to share a fishing stand.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who simply refused to" "" "commemorates Benedict Kiilu, an executive officer of the Kenyan Fisheries authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship during a time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to pillage the fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by NRO Stop illegal fishing (Illegal fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries to work together and work together. they exchange information and stand each other with illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is not regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to track, so illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, illegal fishing ecosystem damage, which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">Yet while actions against illegal fishing could be disabled through bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions now happen in real-time, with traceable at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange existing licences, such lists, suspect news, or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very carefully when they move on the open seas, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">It enables the authorities to identify the ships that fish in banned areas. even so suspects that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the operators have a fishing license where they were traveling and possibly even if they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing companies may refuse to accept such ships in their harbours, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can be forced to sell their cargo as in case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially not worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a report that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fishermen that enter into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing industries, which attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these, even those illegitimate fisherman.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among their practices, actions include actions such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licensing papers, giving fancy species, fish protected species and the fish in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they use specifically the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-incomplete control system," "" "said Long." "" "a ship was illegally fishing and a country could say 'You may not walk my port'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and just this legal swallowing is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks which had spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships which used multiple fraudulent identities and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks organised crime," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspicious ships to be precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed, also helps to track the illegal ships.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, a NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch on, for example, their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland helps to build a system which links various information about the other. FISH-i will help to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened jointly with Google and the Maritime conservation organisation Oceana to open the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide by the position of each individual traceable vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "met together with the neighbors to get a better picture of it," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to stand up their resources." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but they also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships used earlier without license and hardly faced with consequences, know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i had a 33% increase in fisheries sales, since fishing boats more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board dragged networks, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that" "" "Kiilu says." "" "we are a study objective." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear through illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have merged into the so-called West Africa Task Force." "" "they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "" "with safety, the aim is to produce more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country was able to report his first major triumph in Somalia: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which was under incorrect flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used by dragged networks which are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was still entered into banned waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative work for the protection of the oceans actually works in the entire world Ocean.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires active control of the target language - something that is in case of native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native language should be translated from English to French, not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ employees with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be based on lack of understanding for belief, reasons or the relatively low number of English speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees, nevertheless let translations produce firmeninternally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is the best, to translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely distributed - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"" "" "" "the worries and enigmatic sentences which are created through machined translations will show that this technology can still not replace a human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages." ""</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic acies that often decorate T-Shirts or handbags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>

<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless. but of big companies or by the government that have the resources to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>

<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza appears in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining rocket in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and the increase of the ecosystem also depends on that a big noise is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the free wild rink is low and goes against zero. when the team is found in the video that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, the progress that had been achieved for the past six years to revive the life of those who had been hit by the "threefold catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was in Japan's northeast, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate have been settled, because the tsunami had all coastal cities vanished from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture still experienced a nuclear accident, so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress of six years later, in order to rebuild the local people's life.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding and survey results of the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (born in the earlier, saigai kouei juchaku), in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were completed.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi could see the largest success of the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima comes with 70 percent of its final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Still, six years after the disaster, he had to be evacuated after the catastrophe, evacuated by masterpieces (formerly known, Kazaksu juchaku) in final spare parts to settle.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in containers.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December of 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such accommodation.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the event in 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in notices, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of evacuated companies were resettled after the disaster in containers were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation in Fukushima, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have been restored.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, largely affected in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas with only 66 per cent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear zone. "</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely again, but Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist tax in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima however, however, can have only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"" "" "" "to determine a total picture, the newspaper led numerous surveys under the local population and under the evacuation by." "" "she asked about the stand of rebuilding and also how their feeling is changed compared to the tsunami risk." ""</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local resident companies have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents is that still not enough in catastrophes.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is for those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the situation of evacuated Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima not only had to experience the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-caused, nuclear accident, nuclear accident.</seg>
<seg id="578">At 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 there were more than 23 000 people back to Fukushima, resettled into permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the 2017 stand still 40 000 inhabitants live from Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuated ones, which still exist in containers are more than 50 years old. they have to compete in right comfort for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects, which will be part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="627">The popular Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known, regardless of that there are no notable sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities were paralyzed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the vomit the sugar cane industry was silent in the region, and the factory lost gradually and after its installations, until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changes the job.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commuting a day to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a Soldier-Deceteran, who stands up at 4: 00 every day, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not screwed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that in the East of the region sugar cane factories, they are back into operation after a long inactive period because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remember exactly that in Mañalich, I would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the case of socialism, low market prices, the inefficiency, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message could have been a motive for the country some decades ago, but the bad harvesting have been no longer new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that can produce sugar for maximum 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for the unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price climbed again approximately a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Agricultural Perspectives" by the OECD and FAO, Agricultural and Food Organisation (United Nations).</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>

<seg id="654">In the following years, a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene is known as a soldier, over the closure of the factory speaks, the word that he is repeating most," "" "fraud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all those questioned agree: not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order to receive the place, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first press, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents which only differ in terms of parts that would be removed, addressing the mailing and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulster Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any approve.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was arrested and the letters were increasingly frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was in charge for the shut-off factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the still used sugar cane factories."</seg>

<seg id="668">The industrial sector developed by Cuba and the most important workplace producers has been extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the employment and services that were generated in the congregations in which they were created.</seg>

<seg id="674">After two years the local community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich learned that many things change, but not always for the better when a factory is closed.</seg>
<seg id="675">When the sugar cane was closed, or better said than they began to take it off, they also listened to asphalt, this disadvantaged, also other farms.</seg>
<seg id="676">Without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look up other factories.</seg>
<seg id="677">They were split to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">Without future perspective, many young people left the region.</seg>
<seg id="679">In the area a food factory was created, whose production does not even serve for the supply of the community.</seg>
<seg id="680">The ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive.</seg>
<seg id="681">At the end of 2016, Nene was back to the company Boris Luis Santa Coloma, the ruins of the place where he began to work.</seg>

<seg id="689">First Nations youngsters use hip-hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture</seg>
<seg id="690">Recording a song by "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo used with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations-Communities throughout Canada are dealing with themes that are important for them. they do it through hip-hop, thanks to a number of touring workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop guides mobiles directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogues David Hodges, which lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is increasing by the young participants in discussions like" "" "cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable" "" "or whatever occurs in the sense." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where the youngsters are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations-Communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum first nation in British Columbia tells for example the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," on which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women were disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influence of globalization.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, even though the youth did not always prevail in the languages of First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the Refrain is sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will lose our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way to life in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise us one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also lead to our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do that, why she determines the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comment section, the reader and author of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also provides a contribution and adds the verse of syllery (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what exactly is on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (formerly known as the "Plastics" of the courts ") of every dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they are entering the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokioter district of Kappabashi there is a variety of these small businesses that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so usual that they did not even notice them any more. however, a new trend is turning them today in showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now on special sale: new with plastic dishes, decorated mobile tapes, as shown in Kichijoji Tokyu Kaufhaus.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed to kitschy collection objects, as in this case, cooling disease magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shockdown fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom of food processing is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case a kaans-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here's an apple that keeps your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a candle for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing aerobatic flight.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone support and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon are used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "there's someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can cheated my mobile phone with salmon?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition there are also rice balls (onigiri), earrings and handyons made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further skurry plastic dishes can be seen at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter hashtag #, in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you like to learn more about the origin of this trends, then this video gives you an insight into the neighborhood Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. as for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="744">The following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced.</seg>

<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a writer of Animal Político, wrote this contribution from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter in which form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and Sensational journalism since a few years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I'm passing by newsletters every day and see the cover pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is obtainted or sad. it works as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) if it is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic" of offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they were those who have lost someone and those who are afraid to have them something like that.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to block numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "" "" "the insomnia of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbour that they were justified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to talk that they are spared from such tragedies if they are not stirring and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution "Four months blackmail in the main city district: how a family with threats has been plundered." in this she describes how armed criminals were destroyed for the month of money from their business, until they did not only destroy the business, but also their family torn apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think about everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="794">We just contact us if it's absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The more we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She completed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"" "" "" "we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kill or kill you." ""</seg>
<seg id="798">"" "" "" "I asked me in these terrible days, if weeping would resolve my deep root feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with pain." ""</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organized crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other young boys of his age, their parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a fatherless and he tells himself to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm, and "chichi" for the babies who dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"" "" "" "they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unsearchable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live thereby." ""</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father saw, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by the organized crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of murders based on public security and government of the government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor requested 3103 murders. this corresponds to the average of 8,5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are only a few hundred thousand stories that are leaving the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories live in view of always new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," proclaimed Animal Político 2015, whose goal is to project the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the last four decades in understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our longing for pictures to News.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people came to life.</seg>

<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was enched several times on social media, blogs, and other platforms, but certainly not in the context of tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram seized the remote Nigerian village of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Yewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities, before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count bodies," "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were mutilated, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the military base at Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of Boko Haram, to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture of the DR Congo appeared again, as it was proof of the fact and the potential dimension of attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">It is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, the misuse of the image from the DR of Congo is only one in a number of misabortions; Africa check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was introduced as a cover for mass deserts.</seg>
<seg id="852">Yet another step further bring personal comments like this example due to the image from the DR Congo to the sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee, rape, and several dead, some were burned by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following reference to summarize these descriptions with photos from the DRC:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arabic news page, which claimed 2012, the president Myanmars Than being said, monks and politicians could have participated in the assassination of the Rohingya Muslims. in addition, it had used the image of the DRC to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="931">Religion can understand and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth exploring how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>

<seg id="935">The spread of forcible images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the rejection of images of a refusal to recognize the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that forcible images of readers and viewers desize them to feel empathy (such as this study, who underwent how forcible media act on it).</seg>

<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "Untranlatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>

<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemh to help your parents in recognition of how to have tried yourself in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the lists of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the Unhandful blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and dignify the language variety of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia, or in Oakland, in the United States where TLS has already carried out events, the risk that small and not so small languages are not to be passed on to the children there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities, the diversity of diversity - safe spaces in which inhabitants must not forget who they are to be attributed to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "often listen to it," "" "do these events instead" "" "to appreciate the listeners to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their history first in their own language and then translate them to English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and presentation lead to that the listener will be on it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions, when the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storytellers Rassidatou gave account the opportunity to explain the storytelling of storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the fork of the hares and the baboan in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after he explains the meaning of his fork, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" "" "he shares his sense of inclusion:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were quite with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can organise together with TLS in order to organize their own storytellers.</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and licensed here, contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to bassel and his work.</seg>

<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist since March 2012 has been detained at Syrian government agencies.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown location.</seg>

<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge of the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and momentarily the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded the Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps no one of Bassel's cultural prototypes was more previewing than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayward of many civilisations and here merging Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel couldn't know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put all this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>

<seg id="1213">"" "" "" "I have spent my overall life to dream of freedom and from Bassel taught me to embrace her." ""</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel made me English, even when he was already detained.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always been sharing his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he taught others to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also contributed to other prisoners, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without having actually thought of them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a professional journal, which she wrote in years from 2012 to 2015, when he was in detention.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption in which a governmental member returned to the workplace in the state machine after half of his sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is where Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison along with four other defendants with four other defendants (about 800 000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money was from public funds of the airports of Mozambique, whose Council stood at Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for a good tour and immediately requested his attitude into the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the Attorney General of the Republic, which proposed the application, there would be no obstacle reason for Cambaza, back to his old post, since the company was not a disciplinary procedure according to his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people do not hot the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The centre for public integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the decision of the company to make the director again:</seg>

<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be adviser to be sentenced to prison and half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consented to reintegrate into the company that he helped infant damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Resistible!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Violin, young Mosambique and student of the political science in Brazil says, the director is no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the State, because he did not believe it, I can't believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that has already insulted the state.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to the Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the ambush (in Burmese script) is part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the Hasslanguage in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely abimpending connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists than hate speech against Muslims who constitute a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in the efforts to fight Hassin in Myanmar, the company has a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word on itself does not call forth pronunciation.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that too, in which they have discussed the use of the Word or have doubts as expression of his use, have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several burial words with basic meaning that have the same letter as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (Spage-se), 'Kalar Oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meaning of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of mine friends was erased today because he contained the word of Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on the spiritual way of asking whether he could alleviate his back pain by doing a wordplay.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "cure" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hurt is the opinion that they will reduce Hassle radical nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook can be analytical, before making all the posts soldering to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtering the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation is not understood what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spages).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these triangular nationalists are spreading a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate language, the efficiency of this strategy may not be long." ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship is often a catch- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described as Facebook began to delete his posts, as he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was alert to this new directive of Facebook, I made a mail to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook, and I prohibited the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the mail "didn't correspondingly to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hassesses radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, who has nothing to do with hatred:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without Hassspeech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should do more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to zenge will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It also appears as if they started this without local context or technical support and so words like "chair" or "Erbsencurry" banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to purify the fold.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only some respect for the 15 million benefits, they would have a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship got worried for a much ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make sure to see the word "Kalar'not in the context of hatred in order to see if their posts are taken from the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook postings that no hate language, but still removed:</seg>

<seg id="1331">The Burmese text is "I want to sit on a chair and watch peas and watch a Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">Over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks have increased their votes and their influence.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hatred in social networks should also heat violence in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out attacks on his burial pages under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than simply to cut the word 'Kalar', it would have much more current better than concentrating on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012, opposed to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey now blocks the popular and on the crowd sourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">The day is clearer, how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are defending against the distortion.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many techniques used to use Internet users, reviewing tools for blocked websites (a current article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), the majority of ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been unlocked from Wikipedia, as recently in a published report of Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University have been described since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the most well known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continued to remain locked, several mirrors pages (pages, which reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently be updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator machine links) which does not make a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">However, the content is available despite legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the messages (across the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything on the IPFS platform to read snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform so it is possible to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step has been carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely a screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni by Wikimedia Italy, a mirrorpage of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors, if in their country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>

<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, a Mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack another URL which is not the original. that's what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia, even if this is locked in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos that he looked around, never satisfied. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">That would motivate him to wear a camera in itself, trying to graze the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Neptune, tries to take on the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown directly beside the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which steer attention to Nepals wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this first class situation helps in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could it be better for a passionate game photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father, that on the banks of Rapti River it would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was found and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks to gain a collaboration with the authorities to get worldwide recognition for Nepals Nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so terrifying as they look like.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, because he stood up Tigers from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't disturb itself from the opinion of sheep anymore!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"" "also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the Buheath appeared." "" "he immediately takes us, we look at it and he stares me through the Sal trees!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar placed the logo "I click for Conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepals Nature and wild animals, however, is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures from Ottern. up to 12 days it took a tiger to take a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds who live near tourist arrivals.</seg>

<seg id="1471">In many parts of India there are women with great care, to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, use a ponomous or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband due to the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, this practice is alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian state of Oversa by a pseudov court and toast by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also did not name her name, but is also widespread among men. however, they have much less adherence to fear if any, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them healthersonal as well as housewives, a unique club and became a major theme in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">"" "" "" "it is a place for them alone in which they can discuss and discuss the fineness of the Patriarchate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian countries, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal who is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and embarked on the degradation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the discovery of practices such as children's homes up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and runs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made the wall of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which showed the Rohini in her discussion round, did not act their husbands in the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1482">It has decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"" "" "" "the names of their husbands do not speak according to their husbands, is a custom, which they all plead guilty and never questioned." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a wife respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this will be regarded as a crafty, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion round about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never had her husband, had never named her name at home, try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband still weigh long after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said," "" "I should call him from now on his name." ""</seg>

<seg id="1494">"" "many women had never heard the word" "" "patriarchate" "" "never before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then they asked them all," "" "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us, does that not respect us?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush to have broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands on the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"" "the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name." ""</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother in law was angled, she was afraid, saying that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said, "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of participants was less understanding and the situation arted in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the ziner point on the forehead, which shows her spouse:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would carry the carcinating red point if he also did." ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to it to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not cope with it completely, but I think they are now in a better position to choose itself, not to carry him on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion lub is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we do a trip at every discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">I don't want to worry about women who could hear what could hear, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang, talking about things that they never had thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have made more about some things, for example how our identities are linked to our husbands, never as honestly spoken.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only used Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them this is okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt of a pants, wear; they have not geted.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own coat choice, morals connected with the Saris and much more, bare Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) in a discussion round so that the women were able to carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they now decided to plan to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion lub has changed a bit, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly moving into the rolls:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have made only little steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then we stopped to say the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some of them included, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the names of their husbands; only one or two women hold on their forehead now at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in a discussion lub know that the changes you want to achieve in their lives - like the Feiling around more movement of movement or their own closeup - at the end of a difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, it becomes aware that they sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when each woman walks in the club and tell other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to international community attention after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state dangerous) after he was involved in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto, which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called the Lius Case as" "" "an internal affair" "", "he told it as" "" "not required to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to have views from the international community, Nobel laureates and his wife, poets of Liu Xia, to allow him to permit a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should practice pressure to facilitate Liu in foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Minister of Foreign Minister Børge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway got into the Stocks, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian Government did not have anything to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon went to China, since the exports had been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his detention he was not able to increase its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament approved a decision which China was urged to free Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomacy of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius as she was in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife as well as family members.</seg>

<seg id="1662">Previously diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reuters reported that China had major concerns whether the vortex could be overshadowed by Liu to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China asked Liu to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to help himself by his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP before that Lius Ms. Liu Xia could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to contact somebody outside, including his lawyers to contact and contact us.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to preserve its international human rights, including freedom of expression, to preserve and liberate these rights.</seg>

<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will receive all treatments that he, regardless where, needed. furthermore, his wife and his family may have contact to him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu to the country, the Ministry of Foreign announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive him.</seg>

<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my faith that he took and for whom he had taken strictly punished, more harmonious and wealthy China had led to a more peaceful world." ""</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the conference on the occasion of a meeting on the international association of the State of New York, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore as they were compared to Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It is supported that Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is, where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "" "turning the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, we hear that we don't have any country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of a flight before the responsibilities, a breach of breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons provided by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of which he appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York, both cities lasting from a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old lyre from the authoritarian rulers take up the pretending logic, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to its power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end of the last week of Shanmugam, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Jewish system truly Non-Answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He did not tarry relevant questions with non-Answer matters.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng is calling Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, because they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit hard to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country is our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very thankful if our dear K Shanmugam would take on the effort to clarify this point, if it was paid up to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By announcing his commentary on the blog, it shows on the reviews that you should begin to read the whole transcript of the conference, so that you can understand the context of the statements by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the script.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so important, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "isn't a country," "" "he obviously didn't meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, the leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said very much..." ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde which I expected - be I agreed with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes that he is really associated with what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams Arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Did Mr. Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a Freudder speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we will only be regarded as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cops, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the Singapurer afford their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>

<seg id="1728">Is the magazine Journey of a Decade for the affirmation, Singapore is and has always been a town:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This pack seems to have annoyed many of the Singapure of Singapure...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corrosive frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel doesn't have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars a night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">There is a parrots in a cage in the anteroom.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There are no sign for the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm that exhausted from the long journey.</seg>

<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the buggy to Tijuana.</seg>

<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparks hoping for migrants who travel through tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valencia and his family have recorded migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the bustiets are sold too expensive for many African immigrants.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cookbook outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenela explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he told. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was rejected by the United States after a raid on his work place.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants that travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their houses for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez told me that he fled to Honduras, with his wife and three children, who wanted to exerate money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, one single one, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, travelers quietly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There are one of her daughter with African hair, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang from Twitter users,</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in West China, are forced to install a spyware on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, the mobile users of the Tianshan district of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which it points to the district government, a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "hinders" "" "to get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh Women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture, because they had installed the app just after they had replaced the app with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the press release of the police, the app will determine the sources and the distribution channels of terrorists, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, images, ebooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs web page describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing sites to make users attentive to how much time they are spending online and to remotely control the own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers can manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While talking about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experiences of users in the bigger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, thronged ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinemaking Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the media-based media outlet" Images from "" "" Images from Great Britain "" "," the censored messages published in China showed photos of a checkpoint where the policemen checked the residents if they had installed the surveillance app. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification is demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captive by rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Great Britain" (pistol.) also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift the password claim to a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and cellphones in Xinjiang are connected to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang might be a reaction to the instructions of the city party council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and with the party related institutions, including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the orders of the Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib entails the majority of his time inside; let him kill in his canvas, times to his computer, and again also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">What one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or with nicotine spots to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs were forced to escape from their village in Palestine where they lived as a felony (about: farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For more than six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist that joins the conservative majority and asked about gender equality, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with themes such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian geography, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics will not only be found in his hometown, Amman Relevance, but also in cities which from Damascus is rich in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits, and he can bring with their own testimony to the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even though he is not open to US foreign policy, he dismounts a special inclination against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib believes not that his compassion for those who try to do something with his identity as "Palestinian" winged of the second generation, "he called himself even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think about my own living conditions," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he is dissolved in water in two cups, it is the holy month of Ramadan; at that time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for them to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the snap-warm coffee and squadrons of the Kent Cigarette speak mainly in the nose into the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when one throws a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, you simply avoids to do basic things - as in public during the Ramadan water - to not land in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"" "" "" "some parliamentarians, who support the Islamic action front - argued that sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood Hamed Sinno contradict the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for the concert is said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the member and former press director of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was" "" "just" "" "because of sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many claim also, the commitment of the band in matters of Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism that constitutes the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimates the Jordanian people as" "" "progressive supporter of human rights," "" "which still has decided to use an intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is probably not easy to be flattering rhetoric, but indeed an increasingly clear reality in Jordan, which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib joined traditional gender standards by bringing his vision of the fate of Arab women to have vorehelichen sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of a evidenced unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of 'honourmorde' - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honour of honour in 2016 reached its culmination; however, the institutional infrastructure is still missing in order to support women who attempted murder, or domestic violence, in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">"" "according to a law for interruction from the year 1954, women may be exposed to familial violence," "" "at indefinite time in prison" "", "and for her release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee provided by the family that the woman will not happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known for it, also not shy of topics that are long as taboos in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but he cleans his music, which is full of explicit announcements on sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">He became obsolete in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs, which are politically politically, can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">You are free, and any other is also. "</seg>
<seg id="2132">"" "in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get in his words" "" "that one can get," "" "is faith or non-faith, Heteroid or homosexuality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noticed that there are hardly anyone in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya to memorise his comments from the context, twisted and his opinion were censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib advertises the Arabic LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance of homosexuals does not pronounce Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in memory thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat was supposed to work later on behalf of the Caliph in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do this not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, don't have anything with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">"" "" "" "in the hashemitic kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service filed several former government officials and members of the teaching association, with the grounds that they would have critical to problems in social media, associated with the deeply rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is therefore only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a permanent give and take. Jordan has denied a show for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks slower, thanks and internalised changes. he is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreamt about as millions of other Arabs, also from an Arab world without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he is not only dreaming of his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is paralysed by music, art and literature of real and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streumunditions and artificial nature. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is far, Hdaib will continue and thus resist resistance.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant war dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory has been handed over and from one time to date, in the armies of Japan invaded the northeast, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2168">El Callao, Perus most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where road smob and illegal drug trafficking are daily.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for men's aesthetic services.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the fallen hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Pedro Gallesis (Peru), Pedro Gallesis (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has resulted in becoming more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers that can recreate these sophisticated hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme boundaries of fantasy and creativity, has even an annual event inspired to match the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos" which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts will compete against each other in order to show, who can see the eccentric looks that you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests can be found on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located here in El Callao, found here an opportunity to share young people on hair tools and to get their weapons against hairdresser, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the bidelling possibilities, dozens of young people saw that they can take a profession which is currently in fashion.</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the modified version of the contribution "love messages to Guerillacfighters," which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This post is published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important, people who feel out to bring with affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was not exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation BogotArt and Cristian Palacios by the Young Youth Foundation (letters to reconciling) to encourage young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, her country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian Government signed a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces in Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was the signing of the peace treaty as significant, that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Columbians, however, is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrillacfighters who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock, they have to integrate them back into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, must now record them in their ranks and support them when setting up a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young columbians would have to join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love sponsorships at former guerrilla fights to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla steamer - who are to be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was produced at the World Summit of Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak to the Nobel Peace Prize for the Nobel Peace Prize in February 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this explained that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them much more necessary." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent popularity.</seg>
<seg id="2198">"" "so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for the former fighters of the FARC." "" "the letters will show that the Colombian society is prepared to make a discourse of war history to a common history of peace." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive anybody.</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the Stiftung Bogotart traveled to the camp to provide the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC set up as they had done earlier in order to oppose the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of undertaking of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">"" "it was a very moving moment for all those involved." "" "it is incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to luck and everything that lies in between" "", "the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an assistant of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience so:</seg>
<seg id="2208">Having passed the letters, a former fighter carried me through the camp of guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambusches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla war) saw I saw a guerrilla, who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go into, for besides him there was a MGL-Granatcher, a deadly weapon in the sleeping sleep.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "but I said," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter which someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it. suddenly the tears ran across the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely, and set me beside the pomegrower.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry to war, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion to this fighting, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life as war. the FARC was the only way to preserve him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how I have to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Students and some leaders of the FARC came together with a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as war, and the FARC already existed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "many years have we experienced how the social injustice of the State on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to contribute to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country fairer.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "to overcome this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Those people who have never found hearing had never heard and had no election right, and to recognize that people often have learned as monsters, and even hate people with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality, where the country lives, hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">"" "" "" "but it comforts me that all men - even those who have killed, have done so much harm to us, and give us a smile and a hug." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbianians had been prophesied that after disarmament peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as it gives inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to rise to the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from your own experience that nothing is simple. among us who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are coming.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our path, but we will overcome them together.</seg>

<seg id="2269">The man was braided.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitching in my right lung wings.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which medical wings you laid - in men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For that I am very grateful.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, stranger, some totally unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The requested to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me, I had to prove it out through the streets; others wanted that I had not changed my sex in the official TV that I had not changed my sex, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how has your family tried to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world, which has not only ashamed of your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you, because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put on a knitting around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately, the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened window plates and a plate plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you braided?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I will not give up their name, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something terrible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registration without me, without notice, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't believe in security, just because you have left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know already in which hotel you are in. you know even your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was really my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about the gender equality. however, it is a table issue.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally-Caucasian elements still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I would like to overcome this exotic barrier I can't overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">If we chat with camera, I give me some effort to look like the person to remember them from their past - so on my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What are your friends, those who stayed dorded?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had spent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that Ramadan was not arrested and tortured in Ramadan, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and family.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"" "" "" "so I think they probably download the relative, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end request a proof that the so-called" "" "honor" "" "has been experienced by blood." ""</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: will there be men more gay guys in these secret prisons now?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says it wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, above all, those who have no rich relatives or were dropped by their relatives to meet Kadyrows Court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are kept there to present them later as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "Should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they have attacked some village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply vanished, they have targeted specifically to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a mutation or have you a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just cited someone who was imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have gone in this prison, after that it had grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was with himself when these men were taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not introduced as bandits, but there were no reports before. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could one not allow this man to shave himself?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who hear a so-called "non-traditional" orientation already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair ever long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, before 2003, I was already familiar with quite big, when I lived there - and I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia wanted to bring us to the" "" "civil society" "", "but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is that possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were knocked; I had coloured eyelashes, bore tubes and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "the security ministry of the Sharia never touched me only a hair." ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "reproach is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children, when they make fun of sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they simply have closed their eyes before you, because they believed they are sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased, and never beaten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace stay?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov appeared on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began speaking to talk about morals on TV.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed at once, viewed you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teetreffs, meetings, I begged them to the hospital and help them to get food types.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered that people themselves, when I breathed random.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is aligning.</seg>
<seg id="2383">This is the nature, which has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who knows you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no coils with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have those who have the cabiners who have the Russians too; on the whole planet they are - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant to me to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and together during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transiveness to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a truce.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be precise, different habitats.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin and not to harm me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Do not know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am myself now.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The suicide of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab ancestor community in Iran, influenced by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered under anxiety, depression, and he ashamed for his own helplessness to come up for his family, such as Ahmad human rights violations who work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">On YouTube, a video sent on YouTube, after he had lit himself for himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly made it to erase the flames and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly after a short time.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab ancestor minority, and activists from the village, that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some other - Hamid manipulate, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim have listened to.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have a thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the basis of the Iranian government, helpless and incapable of doing their families.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a majority of Iran living in Iran, has been devastated by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power in 1925 and took great efforts to finish ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the region of Ahwaz, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the toughest areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and prevention.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the genealogical stations systematically in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a multitude of demon, the water of the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to destroy the devastation in the region by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi young people now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director of Kooperative, Labour and Social-Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who have completed a job, completed the primary school, 55% have completed a secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>

<seg id="2423">"" "Dohimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse." "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the integration process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer Arab labour forces, the local Arabic Ahwazi will have access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">"" "" "" "this is part of a systematic policy of the prevailing regime that aim to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and earn them to earn their livelihood outside their home of Ahwaz." ""</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their ancestor and surnames to hide their belonging to the ancestor, as even Arabian names are not tolerated at the workplace, because the speech of Arabic language or the fruition of Arabic clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances, whom the Arab Ahwazi must endure, strike the human rights activists before the situation explosives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to wait if the world guards and assumes knowledge.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, Figure will take place with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media. these are a growing area addressed to the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the required medical research on site. there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the particular medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have become far more serious in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and missing investments for exploring these diseases by the pharmaceutical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research which is carried out by African scientists itself is helping to develop their own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be eligible for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed first grave impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we just put solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>

<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods in schools should be taught to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special science education starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as scientists in Africa across western countries, based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding the salad since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and eaten by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was placed only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads can get, limiting borders.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not use them for breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual types, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red- or green, or crooked leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been filed for more plants such as cereals or cartons. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmental protection and expert food safety concerns the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still salad, but now he needs longer, since his work is becoming increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if a boulder would lie in a river, so that I have to dumped." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents are going to go too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand still in court, no one can breed a new salad, because all the features are patented. "he's so good as possible and tries to exploit those features that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavored to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">"" "he also joined a movement which is becoming ever greater in the U.S. and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding (" "" "Open Source" ""). "" "</seg>

<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather as it sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "open-source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used for plants permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders are able to undertake that others can freely use the seed-free seed.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it. "open Source" -breeders allow their seed to cross it so own varieties, and it cannot be used immediately - two aspects that are prohibited or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the Emeritus Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi management board, Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and for environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in greater merges such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter or only little by using natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not work with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"" "" "" "all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not." "" "in order to achieve our aim of ecological sustainability, it is necessary to know how it is offered on farms in August and September 2016, should also know the way that this vegetables is bred, such as this vegetables is bred." ""</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition security without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative committed themselves to keep others their seed freely available. in contrast, its approach can be patented in contrast, seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi Supporters argue that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available gene pool due to the always abundant intellectual property rights to plant material, which thus is always restricted, unstoppable.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, employed in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that approximately one-third of all card characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it not only useful for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are not such estimates, but experts such as Luby suspect that massaged crops such as wheat in even bigger style are patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so farmed that they exhibit specific traits - from such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such as they prosper in certain environments and keeping threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders are increasing by ever more patents. however, genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse than ever worse.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto's spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledge that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the agricultural ministry of the United States, the company is committed to conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, she contradicts to restrict intellectual property other breeders, da" "" "patents and the protection of plant variant innovations." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow when the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection is not inhibits innovation, but encourages them to be provided by public more material and know-how. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it different: 20 years for waiting until a patent is silent, but certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed on plants that are adapted to the modified environmental conditions, you might have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and it should continue to remain:" "" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us." ""</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it is impossible to us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">Altogether Morton is interceptible on the concept to patrol plant features: "we do not really create features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders, we don't have any idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi management board, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who cultivate a variety, will chastise its own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures are needed for cultivating Herbizide cultivators in its varieties of farming.</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto are moving on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents make it possible to survive the most smaller seed companies as well as without patents, or keep it for too expensive and therefore don't be rewarding or both are the case.</seg>

<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years itself, "he says." with a patent one is 20 years ago protected from competition, so that my opinion is quite simple. "worldwide resonance</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declares that conventional cultivated plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks to the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventional cultivated plants.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still Lock the Egyptian authorities" "" "contents" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 05.August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) which documents the human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about that.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticized this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">"" "" "" "the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information - despite this attack and the constitution of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities in order to defend the freedom of freedom and human rights in this part of the world, even if it has never been so difficult to overcome the freedom of freedom and rights in this part of the world, in order to overcome all the technical possibilities to overcome the locking and not reinsing. we insist on our task." ""</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>

<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnists and human rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he does not write to websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censored system of the Egyptian government, itself is the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, who is also home to Ziadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protectors and recorded a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article mainly turn policy and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the distortion caused by the government and reflected what this means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">That, blogs too is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded to convey the feeling of an insulating state; an arrest, an attempted murder, pre-loading of the National Security Council, the lock blogs, and any other web site, for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I wasn't in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a little audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">At first I took it to the post of articles to avoid the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 06. August 133 pages. this showed technical tests in networking various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blocking of suppliers through the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing possible, so called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">"" "" "" "such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block contents and filtering users that have access to Egyptian users." ""</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened that the censored decisions are taken behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by which it can proceed to court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and whom will it attack next?</seg>

<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision declared the newspaper so:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every big city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual abuse, etc. everything, however, will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative to conclude our eyes as journalists in front of cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the chief editor of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist who explains it according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas, which are controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>

<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira argue against the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>

<seg id="2890">Back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was influenced by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashark remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site we worked on.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we don't spare at night. "</seg>

<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and ran on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
