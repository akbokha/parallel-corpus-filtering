that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times rep@@ orter .
for a long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA had illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans .
but there is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally over dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if the crazy sounds , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter didn &apos;t like this ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has determined against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources .
in this move he became the symbol of the government of the government to condemn W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and rep@@ ain@@ ted journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get this information , and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the Mu@@ tigen , they can yield .
so when the government had arrived at R@@ isen , he did something that many cour@@ ageous rep@@ orter did before him : he refused and said he would rather go into prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , though it was for years that it would be indispensable for their case , the demands of the government to R@@ isen have been dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and springs can hide less .
instead of f@@ ailing and cra@@ ck to the statements , it could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , are concerned with his calls to secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , its lending , and even travel records with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ks .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect the b@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . but instead , Justice has condemned to more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as ge@@ heim .
since 11 September , almost every article on national security was the result that a wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower came to a journalist .
so , we put the PR work on the game , which should be protected by the first constitutional status , because the government has more possibilities to spy out all .
but just as the technology of the government is allowed to b@@ ypass the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they may contact it from the moment they contact us rather than in the after@@ ward .
today , there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , just like any ordinary contact form .
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server , which only has access to the relevant news agency .
so the government cannot pro@@ claim any more information , and many of the information that would be requested would not be available from the out@@ set .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments of all over the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is to us to ensure that not only technology males like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to kill the ini@@ qu@@ ities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to tell about abuse during the supply of soldiers . or the next environmental worker , the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , which warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crime , but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of history has been published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; which means &#93; Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness . &#93; This week , we were asked by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange of messages such as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands prime minister has re@@ signed .
there is also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has been involved in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now this sounds like the Plot of a agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , common people .
why should this be ?
but the truth is : when the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
in all over the world media and leading politicians how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases of some few are used to hide and veil@@ s -- something we have been discussing for ten years .
I think many people appear very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function .
I always imagine like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ g .
so one company has a company in another company , in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society , what matters is .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there has been no prominent Americans so far , which occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by principle , after which this tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US countries to start a firm , as to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA has allowed employees to ban school@@ children from school districts .
it is allowed to block particularly vulner@@ able investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so , we sent a conce@@ aled investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , who wanted to bring the suspic@@ ious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really sho@@ cked us that all had suggestions on an Adv@@ oc@@ ate of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ macy . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was given to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as a single sei@@ zu@@ res .
it is not about a single lawyer , which under@@ spreads our conce@@ aled investig@@ ators .
it &apos;s not about a single top pol@@ iti@@ oner , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to complic@@ ate this kind of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very bad , as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I am quite sure that something has started to change .
in the past few years , we have seen lectures to more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies .
the topic was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has gathered in central regist@@ ers at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties involved a bill in both par@@ liament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy that arise and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use them to finish this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
together , we can finally stop the In@@ transparent , which is now possible to finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing .
this is the story as I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and made straight road trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake ask him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land up in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small luggage boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uh , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed to the blanket and thought : &quot; Oh dear ! what have I broken myself ?
a wild@@ card sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , looking at toe tips to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the work of art which he purchased from me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewing angle .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood , actually friends , who only waited for it to be discovered ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make a jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ omm@@ ates with@@ draws and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in town . all hotels were booked .
I think creativity can do it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have thought about how we could earn something . young designers can sleep with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded the &quot; Air@@ mat@@ rat and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at a wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they found it super , and we too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure , our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ ette were completely different because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell to the castle , Brian and I ended up .
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came in the rolls .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people public images of their private premises , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one includes when visiting .
over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the miss@@ ile would burn .
but they did not act .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we all have learned to be dangerous that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you get on things you can look good . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design , between people who never had met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create with Design Trust ?
I would like to give you a sample , what degree trust we want .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zones .
thum@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like to unlock that you unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone back on your left .
this quiet turn of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time .
for the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not read only your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger into your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only so , who now has Al Go@@ res cell phone ?
could you please declare Twitter that it is the president of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones back .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had imagined it with his name ; if he would have told , whence he comes , how his dog or his children be called ?
imagine you &apos;d have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments that all say : &quot; he really can hold fast cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to post your mobile phone ?
for a well thought feedback system , trust strengthens trust .
at the beginning , we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to leave negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest issued their jud@@ gements before we introduced them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford , as probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust the people most , which are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
it is a natural social pre@@ ference .
it is exciting when one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if one has less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation of simil@@ ar@@ ities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted prefer@@ ences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can expect from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
when you tell little about it , for example , &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is told much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request also is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ olle works of art in your apartment ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do with my family vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can we create it with Design to make this degree of op@@ enness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which themes you should write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces towards strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : unbelie@@ v@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
thir@@ dly , a need which had not been covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course there are times , if not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests that have left un@@ authorized parties or apartments devast@@ ated .
the hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
I worked in the customer service at the beginning of the project . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the fore@@ front , when trust has been broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than this calls . it hurt already when I just think of it .
dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately only a fraction had a problem for the 123 million nights .
for people trusted in one another .
when trust works , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for trav@@ ellers , who tend to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel that save one &apos;s life although they do not know at all .
you will drive a hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they get books .
they can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
thus , of course , not every stay runs .
but these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this concept for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s a economic trading here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now it is just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the cause will not be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
humans lay a part of itself , and that changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , compare to fast food , it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what would be when traveling a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group would wait for a group to fill a thoroughly and one at a Knei@@ pent@@ our quarter , of which one has never heard ;
or if one could cook a five @-@ star chef from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to design apartments from scratch ?
what would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of common share ?
I imagine cities which allow us society and relations , instead of sol@@ itude and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korea , Seoul has already begun this project . many parking spaces that belonged to the government ,
now residents were offered . students who were searching for a stay ,
were trained to people whose children were gone out . In@@ cub@@ ator programs have been started ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . our platform alone will be 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries a guest in a stranger or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realize that you can find the correct design with the existing confidence .
design can help us to overcome deep root pre@@ judi@@ ces .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think of it every time , when a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had such great influence , I wonder what we can use it for soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims .
presumably the people don &apos;t talk with their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslims : it &apos;s great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern - Fitness @-@ fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not so born .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to carry Hi@@ j@@ ab my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist independence , namely against the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal .
I was not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought after , stood in question , dou@@ b@@ ted and believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dev@@ otion to deep@@ en himself with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone you perceive you fully under@@ stands , and yet somehow loves ?
it feels like that .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineer .
later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had stopped at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of buildings .
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical error ?
my shock turned into indig@@ nation quickly .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it is not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned into a susp@@ ect .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle East of the US to move into a new city and start studying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember how I drove it -- as deep it went into my seat , and I feared the first time I feared as Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national islam@@ ic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assemble yourselves not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
the emotions were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people that were held for Muslims in the outdoors .
there really was bran@@ dan@@ ings on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people who have attacked this land , have attacked our land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have rejected the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain in itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually listen to people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we loose them ? &quot;
some people want to include Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor can only be found under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less , because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , ambul@@ ator and Olymp@@ ians .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
perhaps a few stops will stop , but not stop the terror .
the regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other belief , more toler@@ ant , and greater citizen participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alized in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alized in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the radic@@ alization process has found that it begins online . as a first , the person is cut off from their church , that the person may believe that the persons might believe the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ or her behavior and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establ@@ ishes their brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as the Muslim , as a mother , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would like to present ourselves in their imagination , when we recognise it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ide@@ ology grounds on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
but if one throws a look at them , she does not take away what they read in their &quot; Holy Scrip@@ tures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding im@@ am told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him , because she fore@@ had to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether she had been in touch with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy which she had spoken , brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense for the un@@ righteousness in the world , she would only bring in trouble .
not inspired by anything and something that would have given their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extrem@@ ists who promised a solution .
this im@@ am restored the connection to God and their church .
instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect any other ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day concentrate on our democracy ?
a study -- actually , several neuro@@ scientific studies - show : if we fear us , at least three things happen .
we accept more an authorized government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
a study shows : when people reported messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they agree rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in advance of Iraq war and two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to be the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
handling Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but toxic air of fear touches us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not only about to explain themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said ,
&quot; when is my Bru@@ der@@ lein become such a sav@@ vy young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon with his execution , after he had posted remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
went we to the mosque or stayed safe at home ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it and for us it was not easy decision , for it was about to leave America to let us control our children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely practise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we chose the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove to silence , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , and went out of my shoes , and went into the building , and what I saw , let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then Im@@ am made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hist@@ s , a@@ thei@@ sts and non @-@ believers who had come to attack us , but to help us .
in that moment , I collapsed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ c@@ ism ?
will you go on number for sure ?
or will you join them that mean : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thanks nice !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a ner@@ v .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk to work a thought in a noble thought factory , thus an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I wouldn &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at Muslims throughout the world , and I did that with the largest ever carried out study on Muslims throughout the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am no exception in any regard .
if people appear as a rule to rule , the rule is usually broken , and they are not the exception to rule .
HW : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is shortly before to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions around the world .
before the air @-@ package is located in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the F@@ RAC Centre in France has built a six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es .
by connecting flights , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration on the closest space .
they can also build self @-@ st@@ ress@@ ful structures .
they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and to respond generally to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possible flight in the autonomous flight .
in order to build a system autonomous , it must know the collective alle@@ g@@ ations where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , calculations on board determine what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are on the highest layer . e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; landing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine , which tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler , it is efficient in advance , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages with start and landing , and is very versatile .
however there is always one side .
a limitation of tail@@ ors is that they react sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is that the flight device is not able to reg@@ ain the optimal position and improve performance by practicing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
during our research , we often create basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the cause .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts to accum@@ ulate you to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote controlled flying units that had only two moving parts : one prop@@ eller and a tail@@ ru@@ der .
long ago , we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est flight machine . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no c@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no more actu@@ ators or control surfaces , just one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior living very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space .
nevertheless , it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tail@@ or . to bring it to flying , I have to take it right .
the probability of throwing it accurately , if all see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night last night .
if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in harmony , this machine is here , the Omni@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this surplus ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ ric .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its orientation .
thus he receives the proper ability ,
move in space to all directions , no matter what direction he is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ated .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
a lot is available in models , the rest will be learned directly when flying .
let us see that .
if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate twin prop@@ ellers machines .
this turns in clock@@ wise direction
and the other against clock@@ wise .
when you assemble them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller depends on electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted .
we will now demonstrate that we make a half air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression .
we took trading micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and pay them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where the room is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas .
the most secure machine there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the impact of this technology .
for types , such as us lies the salary in the development and the work act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them as a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential , the dot is on the one .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes in a very far away galaxy were always faster and quicker , they turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe .
it was a very big pop .
they never put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time alignment and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we command events at first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago , many more serious life was created on Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then Earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stand by us - even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- decided to find a huge laser detector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ant black holes .
most of them held them crazy .
but enough people recognized it as crazy geni@@ uses so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely lot of hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer laser ob@@ servatory .
during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was considerably enhanced , which improved overall performance .
this is why we now call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , difficult problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ amed the two col@@ li@@ zed black holes through the earth .
they went through you and me
and through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the Birth of My daughter
and the part@@ ing of my dead @-@ sick father .
basically , the fruits of my life were .
all of what I had worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist in black holes and her by ob@@ servatory such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gravity waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ us@@ ment in the structure of space and time .
while passing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and into the other .
to illustrate the lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses on the theory of relations often give a right al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretch and du@@ sty . &quot;
the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us stretched and st@@ oked by us at the meeting of the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this is called 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 , and followed the Lig@@ o staff for crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be precisely measured on less than a thousand radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; technical difficulties with the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous .
but physi@@ c@@ ists are heart@@ y and with the support of the public , all obstacles are overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims to be more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what that means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones .
this is quite convenient . for example , you can create a picture or a map of things by giving the light coming around you around you .
it is different with sounds .
sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you :
about the face of your child .
instead , we listen to specific properties like ton@@ ing and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; now Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make any simple pictures of objects in all .
but by mind@@ ing changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audible range .
so if we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally listen to everything .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can give us a lot about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , so my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , plain simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you can hear the same ch@@ ant@@ elop@@ es with an additional key change . it sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a sort of movement , stamped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o Fol@@ ding : &#91; Sur@@ render the noise &#93; No one who knows what he must listen , this can be seen as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which is about as fast as the sticks of your Mix@@ ers .
AA : considering we think about what this means .
two black holes , the di@@ cht@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , orbit a hundred times a second , before they col@@ li@@ de col@@ li@@ de .
imagine this forces .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to exploring the universe as never before was possible .
on this path we can listen to the universe and the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not to see .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ water ponds explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about them .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these op@@ aque are .
gravity waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , because the pri@@ mor@@ dial will never cover its own im@@ shine .
it should be possible to look back to the beginning with gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
and the most important thing : I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen before and from which we have never seen any idea . things we can only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt , which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , such as Lig@@ o them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak the su@@ cess@@ es for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o offers us a completely different perspective on the events of all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we eman@@ ate from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circul@@ ating the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new ob@@ servatory -- a brand new generation of ob@@ servatory on earth and in all .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the urine itself ?
now the time is big dreams .
do you dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared that I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it was nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
no , but yes !
would I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I feared because I feared , my fear removed .
my fear , to keep speaking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Ye@@ ah that changed my life , on an unexpected art . it started with a question of my breasts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she had a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; swe@@ pt , I need milk for my c@@ abling . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was just in the leap . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new setting of life in my family . from then on I sw@@ ayed to play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am trying very much .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has a stunning side effect : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only recently , I understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things off , we@@ aken you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create cre@@ ire TV . I print TV .
I &apos;m TV , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each show offers hundreds of jobs that were not existing before .
the budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars .
we say five .
a new episode all nine days , four shows , including four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows , which simultaneously are in production , times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV shows running on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions will run in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 these 70 TV @-@ hours are shows , which I have created myself , and not only produced , so I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV shows , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who &apos;s still doing this ?
no one , so I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to im@@ press you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tell you all of you who work so hard if you want to take a company or a classroom , a business or a classroom , so that I am talking about a computer , so that I am saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand that it &apos;s wrong with a dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , all reality , all blood , everything per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work much , hard and I love it .
when I get into the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I introduced troops , as a painting I painted on a canvas .
to carry out a high tone , put a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , so@@ unding and maternal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is that sum@@ s .
there is such a change in me if the work goes well .
a sum@@ s start in my head , and it grows and grows and the sum@@ s sound like a busy street , I could drive for ever .
many people take care of , when I explain the sum@@ s that I write about writing that writing is joy to me .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work and work with the TV production , when I began to work and work together , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s !
the sum@@ s are more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you can &apos;t be different to size .
the feeling that cannot be different from a size , no matter what price .
that is what you call the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I wasn &apos;t done for failure , and I just know that I love the h@@ um .
I will only say to you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask .
to get one thing clearly : if more shows , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things at the same time , the more I watch , the more I write history , all the more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more I must work .
and what do I say about working ?
I love work , right ?
the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the h@@ um .
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the h@@ um .
am I just this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated , burned out .
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is one single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Evalu@@ ate , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a titanium .
they are baby @-@ Titan@@ en .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s had stopped .
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my tot@@ als was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Titan@@ en @-@ Work , 15 hours @-@ day , performed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s was me .
so what to do if that &apos;s what you do , the work that you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ shop@@ per yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do it , you &apos;re doing what you do is going to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love one another and this gives you the sum@@ s , when you stop the sum@@ s , if you stop the sum@@ s , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song stops my heart , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; poses a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out to the outside and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I will tell no more than two things to be aware of :
first , I must say yes to everything and secon@@ dly , she called me not &quot; Evalu@@ ate . &quot;
she calls no more &quot; estim@@ ation . &quot;
when did it happen ?
I hate it , if I &apos;m Titan and my sum@@ s are bet@@ ting , and here everything changes from my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
we &apos;re playing and her sisters to@@ ast them , we laugh a lot and I &apos;m reading very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s excellent because my pain and panic , in sol@@ itude and lack of sum@@ s , I can &apos;t do anything except you .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country that I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they don &apos;t exist anymore .
everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kis@@ ses , delicate voices , watch@@ sm@@ al@@ st@@ if@@ te and the song , in which it goes down , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Iron Queen . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not right , but it happens .
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audible , but it is there .
not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s .
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium dioxide , that is just the substitute .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe my brain using shows and TV @-@ hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is .
the sum@@ s is no power and it is not working specifically .
it depends on the joy .
genuine sum@@ s depends on love .
the sum@@ s is the river that comes from life to life .
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , to experience working tasks , expecting and pressure .
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered the wrong words , for what God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I am doing this to the firm rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the h@@ um again .
I wish it would be as simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise so as to work .
the truth is hurt ,
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at home .
this conf@@ ession is painful , as what a man rather than to be home ?
well , I know .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am one relaxed one is none .
we shaved in the garden , before and back , and forth .
we make little dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst silk bubbles .
I feel mainly st@@ iff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe meets me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with playing ?
you can also say it ! then they always say Yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you &apos;re looking for nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dreams .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
and my teenage daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , you do not need more .
for each one can bring 15 minutes a piece , even on a bad @-@ mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no deposit .
the day is short : dinner , the children were ready .
but 15 minutes there are inside !
my children are my well@@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to have a place for his peace of peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play the &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and try to draw . friends , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in training , when I wanted to exceed a Titan in training even more and more .
15 minutes a piece , why don &apos;t allow full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to be back when I &apos;m not working .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a couple of months , the energy flows in and I find myself back in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . I have guided me to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
bubble and sticky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my sum@@ s now .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful .
it &apos;s me that I &apos;m a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , who plays back to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and to play more .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the other , the correct sum@@ s : the sum@@ s of life .
the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling of life in me broad . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think of things , I awake you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neurolog@@ ical surgeon ?
a doctor , trying to improve the nerve function by various surgical actions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; surely , they have heard from one of the most famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tief@@ enh@@ ir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; we im@@ planted a electro@@ de deeply in the brain to affect the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease , which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of working neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was Chief Physi@@ cian and worked in the emergency room for day and night .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they must imagine that brain @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a rises up the brain and inc@@ lined to the skull .
in order to save lives , you have to reduce the fo@@ aming of the skull .
sometimes one has to remove a part s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
to let cells grow from a tissue piece , comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you need to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and environments , to flour@@ ish them .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , it managed Jean @-@ François .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a cell culture . with large green cells , that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you know from the bi@@ ology that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
so , we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells called hot Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cer@@ eb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , since we find them near brain injuries .
this , however , is not so secure .
one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it was Jean @-@ François
and then mark them in colour to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we plan@@ ed it at the discovery of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto@@ transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we plan@@ ing these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we plan@@ ing the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we plan@@ ed the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken away after a few weeks , as if they were taken back home . the room is already busy , they are not used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and calculated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were supposed to be eff@@ ected .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells that we coloured in vitro , in the culture .
we could not stop here .
are these cells also a monkeys to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable history level , we injured the motor motor in the motor@@ ist Cort@@ ex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recover spont@@ ane@@ ously up to some degree , just like following a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just as in the monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , which rested spont@@ ane@@ ously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now you see as we plan@@ ed the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting for us .
since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use later .
we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate them in humans .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to cure herself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need . &quot;
I definitely definitely .
of course , the question , which are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results one has to fill some two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to obtain permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to come up to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s difficult to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients and evaluate the treatments , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ central study .
first , it is necessary to re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
in the west , we make a big mistake , to consider it self .
we do not see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant which is in reality , but as Invent@@ ory of our Society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable op@@ enness .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew of Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ lessly proved that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
indeed , democracy is s@@ wind@@ led with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear that the democratic process of our country -- has been in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would change if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economical model for a genuine democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of an un@@ belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for without democracy , our societies are becoming increasingly dark , our future , and our great new technologies .
for a waste of waste I would like to point to an interesting contra@@ diction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Schul@@ den@@ berg who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognize the school mountain ,
but only a few recognize his twin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest it there where it would be productive and income , with whom you could get productive and also all the things could produce , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods , machinery , office building , schools , roads , g@@ quiet , equipment and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3,4 tr@@ illion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money until reaching it at the same time in the same time and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit which are not equal in the usual market mechanisms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year old in the US , Japan , and Europe as well as a low demand that could not invest in which it could not invest in which it could not invest a low demand that his son would kill him if he will grow up ,
un@@ inten@@ tionally realis@@ ing the circumstances that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely w@@ asted art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , improve human talents , and especially finance the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we continue : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as a social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did , of course , too many ,
women , ali@@ ens , and of course slaves .
however , it would be an error to reduce the job value of ath@@ etic democracy due to these clas@@ ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive cause of ath@@ etic democracy was and is that they gave their working arms , not only the right to freedom of expression , but more import@@ antly and crucial that they are entitled to them the right to political co @-@ determination in matters of state debt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not hold long --
like a candle , which lights very bright , it is quickly burned out .
however , our modern liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a proposition for ruling classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was forced on policy , while the economy -- thus the world of corpor@@ ations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two of these demo@@ cra@@ cies when the economy gradually became underground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you wonder@@ ing why the politicians do not look like more like earlier ?
it is not on de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power because the power of politics is immig@@ rated into the economy and separated the areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey that is so sustain@@ ing the animals of which it is nour@@ ished , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is star@@ ved at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is similar to the economy that under@@ mines politics so far , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of corpor@@ ations is growing , the ine@@ quality is growing , and the executive manager of the corpor@@ ations are to be anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the succ@@ es@@ ful of capitalism , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it &apos;s obvious that we have to bring politics to the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t look very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctrine of de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ party workers through automation and robot .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the tw@@ ins higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper as it -- as soon as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we can democratic the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a disease hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ atie that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements he will survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is being replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; similar to the people who are serving the human being in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long convers@@ ations the sense of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we may be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to call you in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of companies : imagine a capital market in which you earn money , while you are working and in which your funds will follow you from one company to next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all proceeds from capital and revenues come from revenue and the concept of wage @-@ labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction more between those who work the company , but they do not work therein , but employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and work , no large g@@ aps between investment and don@@ or , and ultimately no emp@@ irical twin summit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global currency that will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant account of the respective country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at the time , it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , we have them , especially in the background of a united politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time liber@@ ate , in which she pre@@ fers privileged people and mar@@ x@@ ist because they will bury the separation of capital and work in tr@@ ash@@ can of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we fail into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thank you .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you strike yourself as liber@@ t@@ itious Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do this , the technological development will produce such a massive decline of overall economic demand that Larry Sum@@ mers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is applicable , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and how Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am completely we@@ ar@@ r .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you are not w@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who told it . BG : in your presentation , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supp@@ er of the speakers you have said very clearly what you &apos;re looking from the view of the West on China .
do you want to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on policy , while the area where most plays is -- the area of economy -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to China today in the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China now is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now dict@@ ate that which the West has done itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells huge according to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how to post six months later on the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new start with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and per@@ den@@ ying that a massive covering line by the euro@@ zone went , and continues to be a massive threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity to reflect on the Greek sight -- by the way , the first proposal was revealed to den@@ ying these den@@ ial --
right to do . unfortunately , the powers in the euro zone , within the European group , continue to deny the den@@ ial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one tries to maintain an economic system , which is not viable , however , it may be delayed for a while , but if the change occurs then it ab@@ rup@@ tly and de@@ structive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future when we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , which claims after 6 months in office , especially in such an occupied situation , he did not make any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the school programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the funding , to find a common solution .
but that did not exist .
they only wanted to fall our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the au@@ ditions which ran through the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astroph@@ ic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s worse than during &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Tro@@ ika of the funding made us impos@@ e this policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have a astro@@ us consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we suggest a post @-@ modern 1930 &apos;s path before it appears , it will also be as acceptable for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most , although he &apos;s probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company of Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a fr@@ ills and describes Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard strug@@ gling industry .
there are already so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows which are all right on this curve .
this curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating .
if your show is evaluated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where after having s@@ worn a season , your brain asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts on average exc@@ itation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire them .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it so something , therefore Roy Price does not risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and cho@@ oses eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and expos@@ es them online , where they can view each one free of charge .
and if Amazon are free for free stuff , one gets up to , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are watched at the watching of these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who will receive everything .
you may collect when you start the show when you are p@@ aus@@ ed , which parts can be ski@@ pped or again .
they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process and this gives you the answer , and this reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four rep@@ ubli@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
there is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House lan@@ det at 7.5 -- so something over the average but not just what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy it is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different .
instead of being a contest , he and his team looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc .
then use this data to find out these small details about the viewer : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had gathered all the parts , they went a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about an Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 evaluation on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competent , data sealed firms .
they connect this many data and it works super for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collec@@ ts millions of data , for a decision which one hits , then you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computer .
the minimum , what you can expect is good television , or ?
if data analysis does not work , then this is a bit fri@@ ghtening because we are living in a time in which we are more and more to meet to make serious decisions far beyond TV .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room comes in contact with this software . come in touch with that you are in prison .
if someone is in the US in prison and for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ mis@@ sal is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data seal is also wrong .
yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes .
2009 , Google announced that through data analysis dis@@ bur@@ sts of flu , the bad way , predi@@ ct -- by data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a huge message of news . success cul@@ min@@ ated in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data seal companies like Amazon and Google can sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you ever solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , put this problem into its parts , so you can analyse the items ; as a second , you put the items back together to gras@@ p a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ integrate a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to res@@ ume the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this , and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , there is parts and pieces back together , even if the information is incomplete to summar@@ ize a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and minds , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else it would have been capable of . but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which did not stand in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first they chose TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are only one tool , and to not forget this , this device is rather useful .
many of you will ...
before it was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- exactly here at that moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am going to be a technical demo later .
so far , I &apos;ve met some decisions in my life , whereby I would have listened to the ball in the after@@ ward .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by somewhat much simpler , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
this is perhaps the ball kl@@ ü@@ ger and kl@@ ü@@ ger . finally , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message , that despite the great amount of data still pays to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks to enter .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you will end at the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
