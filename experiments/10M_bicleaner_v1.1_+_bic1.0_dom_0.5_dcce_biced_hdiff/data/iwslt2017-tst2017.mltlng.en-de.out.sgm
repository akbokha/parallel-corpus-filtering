<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">For a long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA had illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence service in which the CIA was literally over drafts for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If the crazy sounds, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter didn't like this?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has determined against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move he became the symbol of the government of the government to condemn Whistleblower and repainted journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get this information, and if they can't protect the identity of the Mutigen, they can yield.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government had arrived at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporter did before him: he refused and said he would rather go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, though it was for years that it would be indispensable for their case, the demands of the government to Risen have been dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and springs can hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and crack to the statements, it could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, are concerned with his calls to secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, its lending, and even travel records with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risks.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect the bistleblower. but instead, Justice has condemned to more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as geheim.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since 11 September, almost every article on national security was the result that a whistleblower came to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So, we put the PR work on the game, which should be protected by the first constitutional status, because the government has more possibilities to spy out all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the technology of the government is allowed to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they may contact it from the moment they contact us rather than in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen has written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just like any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server, which only has access to the relevant news agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot proclaim any more information, and many of the information that would be requested would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments of all over the world develop new spying technologies that endanger us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is to us to ensure that not only technology males like Edward Snowden have a way to kill the iniquities." "" "it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to tell about abuse during the supply of soldiers. or the next environmental worker, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, which warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crime, but to protect our constitutional rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the largest data leck of history has been published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and powerful] [which means] Robert Palmer of Global Witness.] This week, we were asked by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say," "" "OK, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, exchange of messages such as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands prime minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There is also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad has been involved in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the Plot of a agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, common people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this be?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: when the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world media and leading politicians how secret tax havases of some few are used to hide and veils -- something we have been discussing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people appear very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how this tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine like a matrjog.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one company has a company in another company, in another company which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society, what matters is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there has been no prominent Americans so far, which occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not so that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by principle, after which this tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples which have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that you need less information in some US countries to start a firm, as to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the USA has allowed employees to ban schoolchildren from school districts.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is allowed to block particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So, we sent a concealed investigator in the offices of 13 lawyer companies in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators gave himself as an African minister, who wanted to bring the suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked us that all had suggestions on an Advocate of our investigators, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all premacy. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was given to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a single seizures.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer, which underspreads our concealed investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politioner, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to complicate this kind of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very bad, as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I am quite sure that something has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen lectures to more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has gathered in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties involved a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who are mad when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind them." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy that arise and say," "" "Intransparent is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians that recognize the problem and use them to finish this kind of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">Together, we can finally stop the Intransparent, which is now possible to finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story as I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight road trip through the whole country. after that he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake ask him," "" "Where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land up in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I stared to the blanket and thought: "Oh dear! what have I broken myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildcard sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, looking at toe tips to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art which he purchased from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewing angle.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers to me in childhood, actually friends, who only waited for it to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"" "" "" "people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress." ""</seg>
<seg id="123">We make a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommates withdraws and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in town. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can do it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I have thought about how we could earn something. young designers can sleep with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded the "Airmatrat and Breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at a wooden floor for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"" "" "" "I am sure, our cheese ham Omelette were completely different because we made them for our guests." ""</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell to the castle, Brian and I ended up.</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in the rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented the investors: "we want to create a website, on the people public images of their private premises, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors one includes when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a shop that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned to be dangerous that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you get on things you can look good. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design, between people who never had met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with Design Trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, what degree trust we want.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zones.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock that you unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked mobile phone back on your left.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet turn of panic that you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not read only your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger into your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only so, who now has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare Twitter that it is the president of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones back.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had imagined it with his name; if he would have told, whence he comes, how his dog or his children be called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you'd have 150 assessments that all say: "he really can hold fast cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to post your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">For a well thought feedback system, trust strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning, we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest issued their judgements before we introduced them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford, as probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most, which are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">It is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when one adds to the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can expect from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">When you tell little about it, for example, "Hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "it is told much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request also is not accepted. "" "</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "Tolle works of art in your apartment!" "" "I do with my family vacation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can we create it with Design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which themes you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"" "" "" "our whole company builds on hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices towards strangers." ""</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we did not expect was the great deal of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Thirdly, a need which had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times, if not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests that have left unauthorized parties or apartments devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">The hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">I worked in the customer service at the beginning of the project. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront, when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than this calls. it hurt already when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">Disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately only a fraction had a problem for the 123 million nights.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers, who tend to tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel that save one's life although they do not know at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You will drive a hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they get books.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Thus, of course, not every stay runs.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this concept for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with monetary transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's a economic trading here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but now it is just" "" "rental industry" "", "the cause will not be justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans lay a part of itself, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, compare to fast food, it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be when traveling a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group would wait for a group to fill a thoroughly and one at a Kneipentour quarter, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if one could cook a five-star chef from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities which allow us society and relations, instead of solitude and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea, Seoul has already begun this project. many parking spaces that belonged to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Now residents were offered. students who were searching for a stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were trained to people whose children were gone out. Incubator programs have been started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. our platform alone will be 785 000 people in 191 countries a guest in a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realize that you can find the correct design with the existing confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep root prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think of it every time, when a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had such great influence, I wonder what we can use it for soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist ist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslims: it's great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>

<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor can only be found under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, ambulator and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps a few stops will stop, but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visiting of a mosque leads to people other belief, more tolerant, and greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalized in mosques.</seg>

<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes their brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As the Muslim, as a mother, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to present ourselves in their imagination, when we recognise it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology grounds on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">But if one throws a look at them, she does not take away what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him, because she forehad to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether she had been in touch with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy which she had spoken, brought her to silence and told her that her anger, her sense for the unrighteousness in the world, she would only bring in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Not inspired by anything and something that would have given their anger, it was a main goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accuse them for their anger, he showed her constructive way for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight like the Islamophobia me and my family concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect any other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day concentrate on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually, several neuroscientific studies - show: if we fear us, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept more an authorized government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people reported messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they agree rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of Iraq war and two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to be the foundation of a free society that has sensible and well informed citizens." ""</seg>

<seg id="409">Before the air-package is located in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the FRAC Centre in France has built a six meters high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration on the closest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-stressful structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and to respond generally to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possible flight in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order to build a system autonomous, it must know the collective allegations where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demo we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are on the highest layer. e.g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "landing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine, which tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrflügler, it is efficient in advance, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the starters it can float, and has great advantages with start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always one side.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailors is that they react sensitive to turbulence like wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"" "" "" "the idea behind it is that the flight device is not able to regain the optimal position and improve performance by practicing." ""</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often create basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the cause.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moving parts to accumulate you to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote controlled flying units that had only two moving parts: one propeller and a tailruder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Long ago, we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest flight machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No capping, hinges and cross-sections, no more actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior living very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have an elegant algorithm of the tailor. to bring it to flying, I have to take it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it accurately, if all see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed last night last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Monospinner is an exercise in harmony, this machine is here, the Omniter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this surplus?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thus he receives the proper ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space to all directions, no matter what direction he is rotated or even rotated.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">A lot is available in models, the rest will be learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">If flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate twin propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you assemble them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller depends on electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make a half airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took trading micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and pay them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where the room is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate these demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The most secure machine there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types, such as us lies the salary in the development and the work act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, smart creatures to form them as a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economical potential, the dot is on the one.</seg>

<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- decided to find a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliant black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as crazy geniuses so the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely lot of hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the laser interferometer laser observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was considerably enhanced, which improved overall performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">This is why we now call it Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for last test run to clarify some smaller, difficult problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational waves roamed the two collized black holes through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>

<seg id="489">The Birth of My daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting of my dead-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, the fruits of my life were.</seg>
<seg id="492">All of what I had worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist in black holes and her by observatory such as Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravity waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crousment in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">While passing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate the lecturers in courses on the theory of relations often give a right albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretch and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us stretched and stoked by us at the meeting of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is called 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1, and followed the Ligo staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometre laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be precisely measured on less than a thousand radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "technical difficulties with the construction of such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are hearty and with the support of the public, all obstacles are overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims to be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. for example, you can create a picture or a map of things by giving the light coming around you around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">Therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that are particularly important to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to specific properties like toning and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by minding changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally listen to everything.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can give us a lot about the collision of two black holes, so my colleague Scott has been working very long.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, plain simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you can hear the same chantelopes with an additional key change. it sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement, stamped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo Folding: [Surrender the noise] No one who knows what he must listen, this can be seen as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which is about as fast as the sticks of your Mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: considering we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the dichtest body in all, one with a mass of 29 sones, the other with a mass of 36 sones, orbit a hundred times a second, before they collide collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting importance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to exploring the universe as never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why mwater ponds explode in Supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about them.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravity waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, because the primordial will never cover its own imshine.</seg>
<seg id="541">It should be possible to look back to the beginning with gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that we have never seen in all things that we have never seen before and from which we have never seen any idea. things we can only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt, which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the type of stars that produce black holes, such as Ligo them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak the sucesses for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo offers us a completely different perspective on the events of all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emanate from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulating the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatory -- a brand new generation of observatory on earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the urine itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is big dreams.</seg>

<seg id="585">I'm TV, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for providing 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each show offers hundreds of jobs that were not existing before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>

<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 these 70 TV-hours are shows, which I have created myself, and not only produced, so I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around the campfires and tell my stories.</seg>

<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I get into the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I introduced troops, as a painting I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">To carry out a high tone, put a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, sounding and maternal, cruel and sensible. and the best of it is that sums.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A sums start in my head, and it grows and grows and the sums sound like a busy street, I could drive for ever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take care of, when I explain the sums that I write about writing that writing is joy to me.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began to work and work with the TV production, when I began to work and work together, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sums, then you can't be different to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling that cannot be different from a size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">That is what you call the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I wasn't done for failure, and I just know that I love the hum.</seg>
<seg id="631">I will only say to you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask.</seg>
<seg id="632">To get one thing clearly: if more shows, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more I watch, the more I write history, all the more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about working?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, right?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the sums, the sums, the hum.</seg>

<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mom is one single working title.</seg>

<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurological surgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor, trying to improve the nerve function by various surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"" "surely, they have heard from one of the most famous" "" "Tiefenhirnstimulation" "". "we implanted a electrode deeply in the brain to affect the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves." ""</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of working neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was Chief Physician and worked in the emergency room for day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They must imagine that brain-brain traumata rises up the brain and inclined to the skull.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save lives, you have to reduce the foaming of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes one has to remove a part swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from a tissue piece, comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You need to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and environments, to flourish them.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a cell culture. with large green cells, that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you know from the biology that stem cells are unripe cells that can transform themselves into each cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So, we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells called hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, since we find them near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">This, however, is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in colour to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we planed it at the discovery of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we planing these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we planing the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we planed the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken away after a few weeks, as if they were taken back home. the room is already busy, they are not used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and calculated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were supposed to be effected.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells that we coloured in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells also a monkeys to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable history level, we injured the motor motor in the motorist Cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recover spontaneously up to some degree, just like following a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at some degree, just as in the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, which rested spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see as we planed the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives the means to cure herself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can't need."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question, which are the biggest obstacles before you can begin clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results one has to fill some two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to obtain permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to come up to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients and evaluate the treatments, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multi-central study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First, it is necessary to reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">In the west, we make a big mistake, to consider it self.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy than the fragile plant which is in reality, but as Inventory of our Society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable openness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">Indeed, democracy is swindled with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear that the democratic process of our country -- has been incomprehensible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- could not affect the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sincere friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would change if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economical model for a genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"" "" "" "I ask you to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of an unbelief, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are becoming increasingly dark, our future, and our great new technologies.</seg>
<seg id="914">For a waste of waste I would like to point to an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"" "one summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Schuldenberg who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world." ""</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the school mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"" "" "" "a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and income, with whom you could get productive and also all the things could produce, such as" "" "green" "" "energy." ""</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars have been invested in all the wealth of producing goods, machinery, office building, schools, roads, gquiet, equipment and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">"" "" "" "3,4 trillion U.S. dollar sounds like a lot of money until reaching it at the same time in the same time and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except the stock exchange rates and the real estate prices." ""</seg>
<seg id="923">Debt and unproductive capital form the twin summit which are not equal in the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">"" "" "" "the result is stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54 year old in the US, Japan, and Europe as well as a low demand that could not invest in which it could not invest in which it could not invest a low demand that his son would kill him if he will grow up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally realising the circumstances that Ödipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"" "his extremely wasted art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, improve human talents, and especially finance the technologies," "" "green" "" "technologies that are decisive for salvation." ""</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we continue: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as a social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy did, of course, too many,</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, aliens, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be an error to reduce the job value of athetic democracy due to these clasps.</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decisive cause of athetic democracy was and is that they gave their working arms, not only the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and crucial that they are entitled to them the right to political co-determination in matters of state debt." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not hold long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which lights very bright, it is quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our modern liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a proposition for ruling classes.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy was only possible when a full separation of politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was forced on policy, while the economy -- thus the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">"" "" "" "in our present democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two of these democracies when the economy gradually became underground." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="942">Are you wondering why the politicians do not look like more like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"" "" "" "it is because you can be in the government today and still not in power because the power of politics is immigrated into the economy and separated the areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"" "" "" "if you think about it, it is like a herd of prey that is so sustaining the animals of which it is nourished, decimated that it is starved at the end." ""</seg>
<seg id="947">"" "" "" "it is similar to the economy that undermines politics so far, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis." "" "the power of corporations is growing, the inequality is growing, and the executive manager of the corporations are to be anxious to invest the cash of their companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="948">"" "the succesful of capitalism, the" "" "demos" "" "of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind." ""</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it's obvious that we have to bring politics to the economy, and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "keep control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "the doctrine of debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing low-party workers through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twins higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper as it -- as soon as soon as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "so we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we can democratic the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a disease hyperautocratie that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "like a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">Thus, the question is not whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements he will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the most interesting question is whether capitalism is being replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "" "star Trek" "", "similar to the people who are serving the human being in" "" "Star Trek" "", "or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" "" "Agora," "" "in long conversations the sense of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "-similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In the practical implementation I would like to call you in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: imagine a capital market in which you earn money, while you are working and in which your funds will follow you from one company to next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then all proceeds from capital and revenues come from revenue and the concept of wage-labour is completely overhauled." ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction more between those who work the company, but they do not work therein, but employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and work, no large gaps between investment and donor, and ultimately no empirical twin summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">"" "" "" "in the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global currency that will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity." ""</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it" "" "the cosmos," "" "in units of" "" "Kosmos" "" "-- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant account of the respective country." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund has invested in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at the time, it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we have them, especially in the background of a united politics and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is at the same time liberate, in which she prefers privileged people and marxist because they will bury the separation of capital and work in trashcan of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we fail into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You strike yourself as libertitious Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"" "" "" "the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do this, the technological development will produce such a massive decline of overall economic demand that Larry Summers as" "" "long-term stagnation" "" "is called" "" "long-term stagnation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="984">By the transfer of this crisis from a part of Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is applicable, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and how Keynes, and that's why I am completely wearr.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wr, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who told it. BG: in your presentation, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the supper of the speakers you have said very clearly what you're looking from the view of the West on China.</seg>

<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I may say so provocative, China is similar to China today in the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is an error, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, liberals, such as John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now dictate that which the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells huge according to hypocrisy.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most, although he's probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is an executive employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a frills and describes Twitter as "films, TV, technology, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard struggling industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows which are all right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the application distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is evaluated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" "" "Breaking Bath," "" "The Wire" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "" "" "The Wire" "", "where after having sworn a season, your brain asks:" "" "where is there more of these episodes?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">"" "Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to provide" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts on average excitation, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire them.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes it so something, therefore Roy Price does not risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He requires guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and exposes them online, where they can view each one free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon are free for free stuff, one gets up to, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are watched at the watching of these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who will receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You may collect when you start the show when you are paused, which parts can be skipped or again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process and this gives you the answer, and this reads:" "" "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">There is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve is 7,4 and Alpha House landet at 7.5 -- so something over the average but not just what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy it is always searching for this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of being a contest, he and his team looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these small details about the viewer: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had gathered all the parts, they went a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about an Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 evaluation on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competent, data sealed firms.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect this many data and it works super for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collects millions of data, for a decision which one hits, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The minimum, what you can expect is good television, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work, then this is a bit frightening because we are living in a time in which we are more and more to meet to make serious decisions far beyond TV.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-health system is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room comes in contact with this software. come in touch with that you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in the US in prison and for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is made or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of choosing whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data seal is also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that through data analysis disbursts of flu, the bad way, predict -- by data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a huge message of news. success culminated in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data seal companies like Amazon and Google can sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very clever people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized some patterns on the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you ever solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, put this problem into its parts, so you can analyse the items; as a second, you put the items back together to grasp a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disintegrate a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to resume the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this, and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, there is parts and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete to summarize a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and minds, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what else it would have been capable of. but the decision how to put all these parts again and make it a show like "House of Cards" which did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a large personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first they chose TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are only one tool, and to not forget this, this device is rather useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before it was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- exactly here at that moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I am going to be a technical demo later.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far, I've met some decisions in my life, whereby I would have listened to the ball in the afterward.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by somewhat much simpler, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">This is perhaps the ball klüger and klüger. finally, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message, that despite the great amount of data still pays to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks to enter.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you will end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
