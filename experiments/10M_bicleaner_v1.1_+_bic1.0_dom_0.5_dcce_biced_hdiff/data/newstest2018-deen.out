Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view to the city
an Irish @-@ An@@ st@@ alt , where you@@ ths will meet today .
a greeting card where to dig now for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers undergo the former reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it nerv@@ t when land cards are not up to date .
this knows everyone who had to feel more exciting because the car Nav@@ i takes place in a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of State Government , are everything else than currently - but very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it is clear how cities and churches in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
the Digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a spl@@ attered canvas , which one sees as such as such .
the great review card were incorporated for towns and mun@@ icipalities more detailed maps , so called ur@@ positi@@ onal leaves .
this arose according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 18@@ 10 and 1864 and ski@@ pped the initial survey of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
since the spring of 1800 the French Heer@@ es@@ leader has occupied Bavaria since the second coalition of coalition with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns on behalf - of course for military purposes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the French troops entered the Peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville of 9 February 1801 : there were today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a nation@@ wide Bayern map . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing management .
the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is found as all the others on the website of the Bavarian National Library .
the comparison morning / today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ stit@@ ling which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
Send@@ ling was established 21 years after the map of the map , which was in 1877 , being part of the Mun@@ icipality of Munich .
today , sub @-@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of sub@@ merged are concentr@@ ating around 1856 along the Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße that was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmer &apos;s uprising against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where the western park is , you can see anything as fields - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered copies from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ um@@ ption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was derived from the basic income . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , small plots have no more farmers - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the complex &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 of the Oktober@@ fest@@ s , was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the territory of the present area Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen it is not only reading the street names &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tavern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or by the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ventilation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field Road you once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions .
the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was built there in 1858 / 59 . &quot;
in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den conducted the dé@@ cor - the psychiat@@ rist who is brought to King Ludwig II &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example the cass@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in the hair of 1905 .
since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ric regions .
in the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt people will now meet you@@ ths in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ ian@@ um .
the Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth hostel with vocational training .
West is located on the football field of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of homes from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in architectural reference to the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was destroyed during the Second World War in bom@@ b@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 1856 as &quot; main place , &quot; the department store named &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allied forces seized many holes in the city center in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days are working and on 5 April 2017 the Sp@@ at@@ enst@@ ich for the second S @-@ Bahn train line will take place .
the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for the promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to the country due to discri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the state after Mis@@ souri . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ souri , which should come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to be careful when travelling by the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial inci@@ dents in the whole country occur and noted here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently approved law of Mis@@ souri , which makes people harder to gain a discri@@ min@@ ent of discrimination , as well as the pro@@ secu@@ tions of the State , the disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate on minority interests , promp@@ ted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped and killed because of their skin color , they are sm@@ itten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US .
the group cited inci@@ dents such as ra@@ cial crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died in the beginning of the year , after spending no petrol during the journey through the state and arrested by the police of Mis@@ souri in custody , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points out a recently published report by the Office of Mis@@ souri , which is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whit@@ eness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of , and their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be willing to bring it money , or know the relatives that they are travelling through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ ts in 2015 , after the most recent figures from the FBI , the FBI , who made the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it more difficult to su@@ stain a company because of residence or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the immigration authorities committed to susp@@ end people because of immigration violations which will contribute to other rac@@ en@@ pro@@ filing in accordance with AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times we have used stak@@ eholders as response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
soft project is elementary
the Fishing bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU @-@ Bundest@@ ag@@ s@@ led Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac had made a picture on the spot .
representatives of the fishing village of Til@@ demann met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties .
Markus Schwen@@ demann initially allowed insights into his company in which he manages 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest offering 40 cows , and as well as many k@@ ittens and accommod@@ ates in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald &apos;s milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is suitable for him of the alternative marketing measures for milk of its cows , so piv@@ ot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV President of fishing , he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t work on such steep faces .
the green landscape has to be processed for a lot of work , much m@@ uts with the motor sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the dec@@ imal projection and is pleased with the Leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers should be assisted at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation of the surfaces might be gone out for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and make some thoughts on how to continue their job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the dis@@ closure surface amounts to 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ warded until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by half over leader , a quarter contributed by the village of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus , the farmers would like to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ n .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land@@ wives &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter White was also firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best foods are produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Agricultural Development Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state subsi@@ dy of wheat fence .
the objective is the closing of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR designated is the presence of one of the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the surface area must not be p@@ per@@ ish@@ able ( hang@@ inc@@ line over 35 percent ) and must be threatened with the aff@@ o@@ rest@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which is almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently running for the fishing bacher Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ ale project 2018 .
the closure surface corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate it as well as any other - hence the fall of Saddam Hussein &apos;s position at Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologist of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a h@@ it@@ ty battle with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CNN on the proposals of the dra@@ stic limitation of legal Immig@@ ration to the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller does not handle the statue .
a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have put him yn@@ yn@@ chron@@ ously when he had done it .
but he took their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , has been added to his base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down here to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that en@@ light@@ ens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poem , which you refer to , was added later , and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is kno@@ wle@@ d@@ geable right , but how he formulated it himself , it does not really go about history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about the contemp@@ t@@ ful words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the anger of the poor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your troubles , your poor , and your ad@@ ressed masses , who are longing to breathe freely , / w@@ ishing waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was never a time in which the tr@@ ash waste was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : in fact , a conflict around the meaning of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death on the basis - did not know that they have accomplished a highly political action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture should show the links between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ s by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in an worn classic image . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and they themselves have a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devast@@ ating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people wanted to change the right wing for a long time .
the big scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Bap@@ tizer for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is ni@@ ble , but rather an early ne@@ oc@@ clu@@ sion that bring the American flame to the envelop@@ ed world : &quot; lady Liberty goes forward .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tor@@ ch is not to shine through the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is quite unusual here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite a question of perception of the perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was in them to see how they were seen from the exhau@@ sting , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble trips on the de@@ cks of ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome you have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch shall not shine through the way , but hatred that is their sole source of power .
world World Championship 2017 : Neil Black is the Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of world championships &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it , and we will try to understand and we will continue , until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected team captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ monwealth Silver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ monwealth Silver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dles , says it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that 16 sh@@ all@@ ots in the British team are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship were seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance of Mu@@ ir leads to this path and has launched five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are who runs 1,500 m is another sh@@ al@@ lot going on after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships , as the only other Scot@@ sman at the Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tremendous capit@@ alists say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very proud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men did not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is special about the team of team cap@@ turing , is that it was a great honour in the other members of the team , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and voted to me something very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; obviously I am very proud of all the sh@@ all@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as well established athletes , athletes who want to climb on Po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking of critics on Facebook : do not be@@ vel a public office when you cannot toler@@ ate the poll@@ ing of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of all , from the Domestic Policy to its political principles .
he imp@@ acted upon the cr@@ iti@@ que , safe .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in the year 17@@ 83 , Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The freedom strike can be taken away - and , dum@@ b and dum@@ b , as sheep are led to battles &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mar@@ yland to Governor Larry H@@ ogan expected to work out more like Washington .
H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions from at least 450 people who have shown their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union rejected him in the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the govern@@ ance of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter action with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a type like H@@ ogan .
this is a rep@@ ubli@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ ogan is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
he has shown a fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ fully to use Facebook as pri@@ mo@@ res to connect with his voters and to use his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
thus , blocking persons , who come to the govern@@ ors &apos; side - which is a public forum , which is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ ans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse announced the actions of the govern@@ ors and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments was nothing further than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too simple to use the image of trol@@ ls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ind@@ ly people who vibr@@ ate the wh@@ ip online .
the Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ ogan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no trol@@ ls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor rec@@ eded the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ ind@@ el@@ ly filled , but she asked to temp@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented , that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to h@@ ass@@ ling and other latest news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary range &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people on the same subject takes place , then they are considered as a so @-@ called collective commitment and is not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ance of the govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advoc@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook @-@ era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in early times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or burn demonstr@@ ators to silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but exactly this happens digitally .
H@@ ogan is not the first public official that he critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ est@@ ones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the president of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the first am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. district judges James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous let@@ tering en@@ camped on his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous Tro@@ l@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers who made Washington decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pet@@ itions , who critic@@ ized his position on Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with the UK , overwhel@@ med his office , according to historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not put them silence .
reproduction , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Loth@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who took links in the Arch@@ er@@ field , last year before he lost to Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen such as the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he reaches his glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he &apos;s in a great condition .
Jerry made a great job when he made this place .
he is a eager advoc@@ ate of this game , and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship , although he won the European Tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player , in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since it was won in the year when I had won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories come back from the last year , and it was something special to me and my wife Sharon , last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to his home base .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it is always a little bit more if you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r said the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
in the past two decades , less people have died due to pas@@ siv@@ ity in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are coming to this result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attri@@ but@@ able to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved up his own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time , there were 400 lung cancer cases because of pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany .
the new examination is published in the International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and is reason@@ ably in time , &quot; says the director of the Bau@@ haus Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of house@@ connections , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as a lot of ver@@ ges in the underground , which is not noticed in the plans .
the traffic that is always hin@@ dered the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tip of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red lights and barrier is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the bus buses are entitled to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks since weeks .
&quot; the hot days were pretty stren@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with a cool mineral water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks the dinner , they do not use a stove .
they even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the chim@@ ney .
after half an hour , the stolen bu@@ ds will be removed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and dev@@ oured .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , for example clothes with dim water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
the most recent of the four wives of her husband were not assigned to their fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late at work can be dangerous : most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life of the Hochland of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia when only 1.0@@ 26 elders were allowed to vote against the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , which touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal observ@@ ations thereof .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea as the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is br@@ ittle . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
the town with approx . 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is made of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo , and out of corrugated boxes , which were transformed by rust in different yellow @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indones@@ ians have taken their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreign foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans despised one God named U@@ ga Tam@@ il .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wear these clothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points on her lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s p@@ oo@@ rest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and alphabet@@ isation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold .
the largest and most profitable Gold@@ mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a strongh@@ old in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort lost its value of 3.1 billion US dollars in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources valued at the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , these riches are a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military has preserved a ch@@ oked presence .
a study conducted in 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort &apos;s local military personnel and units paid almost 20 million US dollars from 1998 to 2004 , including up to 15@@ 0,000 US dollars at a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these gold g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ ess .
according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were rap@@ ed since 1969 , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 .
massac@@ res in Pap@@ u@@ as tri@@ bal country in 1970 @-@ s were referred to as in accordance with the Asia human Rights Commission for genocide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will All Under@@ stand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in a report by the Erz@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane taken in 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year are , such as un@@ legal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since each week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have strengthened since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % of Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim audit@@ ors come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an E@@ ado S@@ ado , fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce .
local people strug@@ gling to keep here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Local which moved to the capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ und as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke of ine@@ qualities during his campaign in 2014 to tackle ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua little changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You .
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October a low point .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs from a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two ind@@ ones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorbike through the darkness .
the dried children told them that they should switch their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took attack on their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and struck the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers pier@@ ced into the group of children .
a child who was 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things were es@@ ied on the next day .
about 1,000 young pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice .
they carried out cerem@@ on@@ ial hunting bows and led the orph@@ an dance - in circle constantly and a bird singing - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some protest@@ ers began to tow stones on police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command to an internal radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the masses have more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which has not been released to the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Vier@@ bot of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame does not know who has fired , but say that the ball came out of the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting was .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and under@@ went his body to make sure he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who carries only one name , the TIM@@ E , in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters , that his officers would only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they may be attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies to the families of the victims and s@@ wore to the historical ab@@ normal@@ ities in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Minister of Security , Wir@@ anto , said he was an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the drawing of historical human rights violations .
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle such violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto did a retreat when he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
instead , &quot; everything is legally regulated , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who has indicted the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations have been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with flu @-@ unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after he was helping to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the shooting plants have not stopped .
on Tuesday , the Indonesian police attacked the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confron@@ tation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma that refused to bring a un@@ conscious man into hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .
the vill@@ agers protest@@ ed in front of the company &apos;s location .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers to react by warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting the crowd and killed one killing .
&quot; we were so panic , we are afraid that it will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured one is quickly delivered , so the TIM@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to withdraw the participating officers and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
lack of sensu@@ al development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal members , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by pushing sporty attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das K@@ og@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the last few years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and were randomly taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tast@@ ed 10,000 Indonesian Rup@@ iah ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants that have arrived at the Nab@@ ire Airport in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes .
the few jobs that are in the region are usually aimed at the better educated and weal@@ thy migrants .
Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to perform their own company competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
furthermore , the coverage of international media remain ten@@ se .
in the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported due to a lack of coordination with related institutions in Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development , was not realised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Visa ref@@ usal and a black list &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure is largely restricted to the Indonesian government to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six pac@@ ific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine islands and the Salom@@ ons Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supporting O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and told journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there is free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people in the spot want more foreign governments to note this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of human right @-@ Ambassador K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura left her silence and pressed him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We want freedom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but not anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Indonesia won another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good inten@@ tions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai influences , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribe of the tribe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; armed military &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lives , is in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; carried out a final symbolic act of a victim : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that they may never be justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us says .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
a fire was found in Dubai in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fir@@ ing , which in only two years swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which one calls randomly the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; we slept and we got up at the Fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to bottom , &quot; a resident told its name as George An@@ ab , Reuters .
in Dubai , civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) , fire ra@@ ged the fire and ch@@ illed the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can be used for safety of materials that are used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the biggest part of the damage caused by facing , outdoor clothing for decoration or insulation , came .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ ad@@ ab Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in June , with approximately 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has dropped by his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the Davis Cup single @-@ single was only supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , that Davis Cup single is not supported by the necessary two @-@ third majority .
the most often very long , but even therefore very estimated five @-@ set classics stay so traditional .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the countries voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore just barely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members will not have the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for the vote was come after many claims before the proposal had already applied to a neutral location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the following round in the first round .
to reduce the cost of organizers , requirements in training places and training will be facil@@ itated and the players will complete less official media appoint@@ ments prior to the Davis Cup less official media appoint@@ ments .
more than 1 of 5 US trav@@ eler gets forbidden objects in the aircraft , finding a survey
a survey among passengers demonstrated that over 20 percent are deliber@@ ately or deliber@@ ately forbidden items in the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration by using at least 6 percent , while the aircraft were in@@ advert@@ ised , while they acci@@ dentally used kni@@ fes or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they were delayed until they have travelled underground with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people , which was carried out by a jet Char@@ ter@@ service , the Strat@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also firm that younger trav@@ ellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the enco@@ res that they might be wis@@ s@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally tow@@ ed to T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent , knowing how to have borne objects with security control , while 2.2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they would have been inten@@ tionally forbidden drugs to the aircraft .
the company said that travelers were inter@@ viewed in the whole country to figure out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ alle@@ g@@ ware could have brought through the airport security and how many things were inten@@ tionally done .
it &apos;s no surprise that people , the most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ alle@@ g@@ ware - wis@@ s@@ ingly or un@@ wis@@ s@@ ingly - by security , those who are the most frequently flying .
however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA policies are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often in@@ secure which liquids can take it away or how much of it .
so , there is no surprise that the biggest amount of objects prohibited by T@@ SA are prohibited .
for a time , the people who T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers order
with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 &quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders .
in doing so far , he has under@@ estimated that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn its non@@ committ@@ al reservation .
in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k gave the first time to betra@@ y a different , less gl@@ anz@@ full number : the cancellations made for the new mass market model 3 for the first time .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k often applied for the new car with more than 500.000 openings for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .
now Mus@@ k was dre@@ aming : the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders had already been with@@ drawn 63@@ .000 .
critics have always pointed out that it is only indic@@ ative reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
at the moment , 45@@ 5.000 of such non @-@ indic@@ ative reservations are presented , in a telephone conference with anal@@ ysts .
however , the cancellation of up to about twelve percent of all orders could be addressed to the problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe .
his argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site .
last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it shall be - all models together - 500,000 will be one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are available per day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; may expect the delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 when Tesla creates its brand new , never in the practice of tested production lines without greater inter@@ ru@@ ptions with maximum load . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to bigger delays , then the in@@ firm@@ ity of the reservations might become a problem for Tesla .
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt goes back to reduce emissions due to dis@@ hes@@ itation of the Rules of Obama @-@ Er@@ a
a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the boss of the Environment Agency , took back his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of smo@@ g caused air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as its agency proved to be more respon@@ sive to the needs of state environmental authorities .
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit , which was raised against his previous place in a federal court .
it &apos;s about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground @-@ related o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will ins@@ ure compliance with a year in order to study more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inter@@ fere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump of State of Oklahoma , was a long time a reliable opponent for stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repe@@ ating to block or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the youngest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ptions regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA Administrator has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane le@@ aning , to delay .
in a report published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply beat the read@@ iness of the EPA for cooperation with the States by the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under former devast@@ ation , the EPA has often kept the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waited for carrying out activists and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court and we take some dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless the opinion of EPA reported that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commitment to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress come to a comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill accepted last month is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet placed in the Senate .
the New York @-@ General @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the United States Coalition to grant the EPA in this week said , the group intend to maintain the statutory pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of EPA - according to our claims - is an important profit to health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New York , which are affected by the smo@@ g directly affected by the smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ien , Rhode Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
floor @-@ Oz@@ on arises when poll@@ ut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight react .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respir@@ atory problems with sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health care and environmental protection che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ ptions surprised course change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is al@@ ar@@ ming how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of air that we in@@ hale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must fight against the ide@@ ological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Government to combat environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , July 16th at 16.@@ 30 .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth benefit ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chant you out of this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ours .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a sing@@ ular little od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Baden @-@ Württemberg Ur@@ gon@@ book : Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain to Tum@@ lingen with the Vog@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
the wording of the document was based on the Tum@@ linger Berg , besides the former parish church , besides the former parish church , which belonged to the church , or the patron saint , and not vice versa .
so there lived people there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , beside the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today are still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the third , the magnificent sett@@ lements of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ walls these historical real@@ ities .
the patron was taken from the early medieval property law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church , and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and he could also inherited this owner .
thus , the right to put a priest or to submit a new pastor to the Bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two cr@@ ush on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 .
on the 30 @-@ year @-@ old war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window plates were st@@ acked and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of listening .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the steep@@ le had to stand .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm caught the steep@@ le and half collapsed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was canc@@ eled .
only today existing tower @-@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em from the &quot; creative sen@@ iors &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as organizers invite friends and sponsors on Sunday , July 16th , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
this is designed by the com@@ bo of the Kepler High School of Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Reinhold Matt@@ e@@ is .
entering Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program begins at 16.@@ 30 .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 a.@@ m .
to end the ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk in front of the cemetery is taking place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers provide fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade only occurs in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope for a lot of supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant which is of importance for tum@@ our and listening .
the friends and promot@@ er tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade @-@ organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
club wants to check permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not look any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned into the country council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim is denied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) called to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in quad@@ ru@@ ples , a wind power concentration zone has existed .
within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but causes the concentration zone but a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city area .
such zones should prevent &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; of the landscape .
although the town square had decided that a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette had decided that in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , the city government had not approved Düsseldorf for a lack of forms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the appro@@ vals is modest and thus also decreasing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council again adopted the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette before the summer break ; an author@@ ization of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the receipt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have entered the district since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes you to the occasion to check the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
with a view of the ongoing proceedings at the Administ@@ rative Court , the district wanted to express itself in content on Thursday with the arg@@ ument@@ ation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , construction of four 200 meters high wind turbines .
already last year , the company was involved in which the city quad@@ ru@@ ined in the city , P@@ acht@@ ver@@ ts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares closed .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is equivalent to one @-@ fifth of the power requirement of all four @-@ sen@@ er households .
the NEW Re want to invest some 20 million euros .
in the past summer , there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park L@@ inn@@ ich near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district .

city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the Trade Association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on September 8th and 9th to enti@@ ce the local residents to downtown .
as the chairman of the commercial company , Christian König , announced that the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend will sensiti@@ ze the customers that offers their own city away from the usual supermarket commodity .
a market with regional suppliers is therefore planned , similar to the weekly market .
you should also present home companies with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , you should invite the shops in the city centre for &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot;
the action is not only to the inhabitants of the city and the local area .
in preparation , commerci@@ als in radio , an Internet video and printed bags , which refer to the action weekend , Christian König .
municipal authorities and Trade Association co@@ operates with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
thus the Trade Association and the City go into a further step in the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest , with selling Sunday , talks with all commercial operators and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers for Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential new or again will be opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also have lost the city centre when shopping .
at the end all would have to contribute to besie@@ ge the city center - to land@@ owners , the factories all over the city and clubs .
they sailed to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that was partly spread , King had said in the spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities took part in the national park in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , Germany , for the first time to participate in five Thur@@ ing@@ ian cities .
in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ sa this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should advert@@ ise the value of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also make clear that every citizen can influence its purchasing behaviour as a direct environment itself .

Tr@@ ump replaced after crossed tran@@ scription of phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , to say publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. president imp@@ acted him because he had den@@ ounced the wall publicly . report he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and s@@ wore to make Mexico for the project .
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and contained a ten@@ sion@@ ed exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump told that a trade for the USA refugees who emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that it would look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he said to Mr. Turn@@ Bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury traveled by a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver that could reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the bul@@ lying - a man of middle aged in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates suspended in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ aring the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
cri@@ es out the silence , as a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this awesome scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a post@@ age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience is very true si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , civil rights have come back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - though we know they are in our congreg@@ ations , though we know who they are , &quot; Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who as@@ sists in the organization &apos;s organization .
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , post@@ ing is as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want the prosecution , we want to finish , we want to heal , but first we need justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of court puts a towel on the body of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ x victim on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files , which have been received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ Process .
but no one was ever indicted .
although the susp@@ ects has been on free foot since decades , Citi@@ zenship say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always well known : policies and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer .
about at the same time as the choice desc@@ ended according to the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ani Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , bar@@ nett h@@ ester during a struggle - allegedly due to a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ours in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby was born , not by her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ col@@ m from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her Cou@@ sins Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approaching the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car .
&quot; as it turns out , Harrison , who prepared the mur@@ ders and arranged , &quot; includes a FBI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in Mor@@ den , the evidence of the evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks put it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a electoral massacre &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you sign up and when you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual re@@ position of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is illustr@@ ative , moving and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , by which many believe that he does not exist in America .
it is difficult to watch , and even more difficult to look out , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we will be confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and listened , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is an old co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the head @-@ C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ter for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ col@@ on and Bar@@ nett , play their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ col@@ com , the H@@ ester sh@@ outs and urged him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- he , w@@ asted from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a wi@@ dens the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said Gre@@ ene , still ch@@ ich@@ ever .
&quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but &quot; wit@@ ty one of the other black actors .
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and that &apos;s exactly the energy in space , a sense of camera will replace the un@@ eas@@ iness .
everyone has been busy making this right , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
there are sn@@ ails , shots , and then silence .
a woman clothed with a fun@@ eral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of actor and performs tr@@ illion holidays sad speech &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from her eyes .
the audience is divided between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as close humidity every eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders stayed a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you were on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de found , the air feel sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sounds , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to insp@@ ect the dead .
children hollow in their heads , sign up the f@@ ake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ pers one another .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as a new case he would remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene &apos;s lots - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors dis@@ card the Lyn@@ x and wi@@ pe off her tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ced Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in turn , who played the C@@ lan@@ member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms , the emotional bur@@ dens of performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; one of women whis@@ pers .
&quot; we know that this is not in your heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this out of one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sit together with the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta ch@@ atting over the post@@ ing with a black pair , which they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski therefore strug@@ gled to find words which the performance has left behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and that they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I really do with me , makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks courtyard at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post@@ ing is inspiring in a certain way , as it describes the hor@@ ror of what we can bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e production from gigantic , six @-@ story scenery .

the three Rhine @-@ bre@@ eders - sung by Stephanie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - are already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful .
do not lead Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , zer@@ ren in Hollywood @-@ mania a body in the luggage boot and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous fi@@ esen Hagen , who surrounds the aura of a heavy weight box@@ ers .

later on , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who was mo@@ ist and conf@@ essed his hands to the Merkel @-@ smo@@ te .
big appl@@ ause exists for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in le@@ ased leisure clothes .
the appearance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his assistant team .
in 2013 , he had to leave a ball concert with a ball concert in 2013 , there were five years later great ju@@ bel in which the single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pack went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has been an understanding for its view .
I draw a positive res@@ ume army .
max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does it come from ?
quantity : I did a high school .
and then a construction engineer , we say , successfully stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognize that it is wrong for me and I want to do something different with people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
join a social year , there is an insight you can see as it is on site , in the focal point maybe even , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the university of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual during the volunteer service have several different locations ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it will always come to where you make his FS@@ J .
it can make it from aging to youth work - in all kinds of fac@@ ets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ gs , so in afternoon care .
for me it was the right thing that has ger@@ ated me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths , as it really runs out .
different than in the construction engineer ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not necessary to calculate st@@ ati@@ ks .
one always has other people in front , each of which have a completely different story behind .
whether a refugee camp , whether a teen@@ ager has been caught up out of the family - you always have to respond individually .
very interesting .
and you had no contact fri@@ ght ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , much kindness .
there is also negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is .

EPA returns to delay the smo@@ g rule to clari@@ fications
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of government Obama &apos;s government , termin@@ ated what the states are obliged to sei@@ ze the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 States def@@ endants the agency because of its step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to push the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will show the commitment of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA which should be measured in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , in which in a part of the country poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions should be determined to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay another year until October 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ ted a broad range of environmental environmental that has risen to the former President Barack Obama as a part of a bro@@ ader agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the Democrats and reserves caused by wor@@ ries about the impact of larger emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that the in@@ hale of air , the o@@ zone , contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lung function and rein@@ force respir@@ atory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants to be common room
at the end the decision was clear : with two oppos@@ es the community of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds decides to set up a community in the future sen@@ iors living room .
before discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing land part is signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ adas .
although it is still time to date , until the church community belonged to the community , there is now no planning event for the project of a private investor .
there is a discussion about a community area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres of space available for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council is floating , such a common room not just as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ just living , but open to the community .
for example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ Cafe &quot; made the turn .
the decision taken by the provision of funding for the current budget has already been decided by funding .
the building is situated in the residential area .
the establishment of a community room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ adas , with 60 percent of 30 percent .
the resolution looks to sign@@ alize the investor to indicate that in this respect , there is no b@@ ill@@ ator between the legs , which reduces the ceremony - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach - which reduces the tr@@ ample and making the construction of economic power - is possible .
need@@ less , so do not only Wil@@ fried S@@ oh@@ mer , be this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously it happens to the body .
it is not as simple as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings with which you are not so far forward , but you can now return to the common room from the window , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am difficult to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger really speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a conce@@ aled subsi@@ dy of all assets or foreign investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a surplus , but I get a real , in doubt , in doubt , in a doubt that is a market@@ able object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application , applying the decision to orders , will find three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there will be two votes in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step further to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

w@@ ander to star in the resin of star
in Har@@ z , the nation@@ wide first &quot; star @-@ path &quot; should arise .
this is the planning of the Club Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Planet@@ arium path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; to meet the needs of many res@@ ellers , it was called .
he connect nature , science , movement , and sports .
the members aim to place the routes along the planned route and inform about stars and stars .
during a first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; Acces@@ sible installations to five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z .
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ enz@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards will be comple@@ mented by the Internet .
this is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection .
acc@@ essibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train should be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewer will learn a lot of knowledge about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why a star more lumin@@ ous than another , although it is much more distant .
it may also be taught in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association operates already since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest situated star in northern Germany .
the site is located in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park , according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the six dar@@ k@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently from there are the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy far to see clearly .
in the Uni @-@ Stadt since 2003 there is something similar to the initiative of the planet@@ arium Göttingen , something similar to the planned star value - the planet route .
starting to Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the Hain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restri@@ al &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away , while the sun measures 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters away .
the entire distance of the planet is four kilometres .
while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to is about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour till the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fi@@ xation but would last half a year .

Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia who should stand in a coll@@ ision course in order to produce the most exciting boxing contest in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN &apos;s offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the proposed World Boxing Council Ligh@@ tweight Champion , down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Boxing Organisation Super @-@ Feder@@ er champion .
after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Garcia was stretching out the right hand and said , &quot; How are you doing , champion ?
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 19 o &apos;clock on Saturday night .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Climate Change , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; re@@ minded Garcia .
&quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big .
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I would like to get down to light weight .
and he must move on lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is asking the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut in this year , in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Garcia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , which was also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could be held in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans have asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia and pressed later to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this type of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Garcia said he &apos;s about Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous mil@@ iti@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held the generous praise for Garcia in the generous praise for Garcia and said that he is looking to see the fight champion from River@@ side , &quot; very slowly , sorry I &apos;m sorry for Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Off . &quot;
Garcia said , the focus is to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Garcia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; I waited for the top fighter , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured following T@@ ire Pl@@ aces
on Thursday afternoon , four people were injured during an accident on the A7 .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira has lost its control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 am shortly before the front end of the market .
the passenger car sli@@ ps on the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he struck and then remained on the roof in the tomb .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured service , the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour , and the traffic on the left track was passing by the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann is hoping for 2 : 2 at the season open@@ er against Br@@ uns@@ wick that the optim@@ isation of the defense report will bring into Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , but would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we must watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge the chain chain should also be optimized .
and a gate after a free day the Fort@@ unas don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ensing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his crew also has to do better after the experiences in preparation with the tri@@ cky chain than the vier@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause safe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we just got up on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann Player who can build well &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , but that we do not yet harmon@@ ize , and we do not have so many play@@ ings in building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one cannot talk about a mis@@ guided start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance could be okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we could focus on Sunday with four points and we will be able to concentrate on the cup , surely we will certainly speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw the start into the season only after six to eight play days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Radio , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled due to a wet@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now she can begin the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the player could possibly be something fresh because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for asc@@ ension path@@ ites in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the internal defense of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as a little favorite on Sunday in the meeting finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we take away from it , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to beat from the out@@ set , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience his players on Sunday .
new Results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Pap@@ ts@@ ab@@ al@@ er@@ ket ) has started with the execution of tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( Mig@@ ration@@ ation ) was critic@@ ized because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were inferior .
until today , Mig@@ rant @-@ ket 6.@@ 880 has been sent to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March until July 31 , 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may be &quot; perhaps under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson , by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are stable over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no difference in statistics of past months , the figures are rather constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases when the person was evaluated over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has lied over his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the sought person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska Dag@@ bl@@ adet susp@@ ects the 5@@ 81 results published , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said to be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , used in X @-@ rays of wisdom teachings and MRI shots of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ized in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the Endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were so@@ oner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way , is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do it as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess the child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven tons of emphasis was installed at the bridge on the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; says Reinhold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of roads and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Freiburg .
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule is kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised by red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and transport security , the three buildings are now thoroughly re@@ arranged .
the other two bridges lead across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were established in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been on Wednesday morning a 1,@@ 30 meter wide and seven tonnes of heavy so @-@ called stock flap .
this is an edge , which is also used as an operating way .
on the southern part of the bridge on Friday a 2.@@ 20 metre wide bridge can be used .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should go .
the special thing about it is , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented stock caps .
a special finger @-@ feeling has the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass fibre cable attached to which many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed on the project prior to work .
furthermore , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be qu@@ en@@ ched first .
for the bridges between the Bau@@ hof@@ strasse and the Flat@@ ant@@ in towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for construction work on the bridge on Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road is closed in the area of the bridge on the height of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridge amounts are 700 000 euros .
it is financed by the country .
AF@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ lower protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties are drawing at a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AF@@ D ) , everything else is difficult to bring with a hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vol@@ cano ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which this day shows peac@@ efully on this day because the AF@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell invites you to the poster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great electoral event &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and well @-@ known names of the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Vice President of the Chair Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are in front of the event already hours before the event , do not want to listen to the AF@@ D , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All on a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AF@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful image that has been offering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the relevant organizers , really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad that could also eat the AF@@ D &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police has ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all in the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the AF@@ D have come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the AF@@ D volcanic ash , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ ren@@ ti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at 20 o &apos;clock there is a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle , various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische AF@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young .
in the hall there are about 200 listen@@ ers who are waiting for the general election date for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Vice President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will keep their speech@@ es .
the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour takes the AF@@ D event , the guests on the fore@@ court have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can press down - no special inci@@ dents .
trombone meets trumpet
a re @-@ hear with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concer@@ ts tomorrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the conv@@ ent church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he is a concert with the motto &quot; Black Sea , meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and experienced solo orchest@@ ras in the European leader .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ t@@ Orchestra of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
both un@@ ites the lust , not only crossing borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of various gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach on both the two as in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World Music &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; together with Bulgarian fol@@ klore , and in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ re@@ ist@@ ers N@@ ils W@@ ake , mix classics , jazz and the free games to a fascinating entire art@@ works . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this core of the program was first performed with huge success in Freiburg this spring .
renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ alt@@ z has written it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche , with its special acou@@ st@@ ics , deliber@@ ately become involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Stewart is quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that &apos;s cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
probably the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ stars was the one of their &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately under@@ went bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all , the brunette performer opposite the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with all who I had . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation Kri@@ sten gave up that it was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never has confused or hin@@ dered me .
I never really liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially those who suffered them according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in school time they rather like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , fri@@ ghtened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public they don &apos;t like to educ@@ ate their love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify it before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic Governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke before the West Virginia rally in advance .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not appro@@ ve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton .
justice , according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes proves that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited a carbon business from his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can national committee on Thursday evening issued a declaration in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow for a democratic party that would rather hin@@ der us than to work towards our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal entities in history is the last re@@ jection of a party , which is from above until down without leadership , and is not capable of finding a positive , combined message , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
the worldwide boss of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be resumed in sport .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who were taken out of competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was approved for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found indications of state @-@ supported d@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself some quite hot times and everything will do to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; CO@@ E said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glad that Russia accept the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was achieved , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment that Russia should be used again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the basic principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he added
nin@@ ety @-@ ten Russian athletes will begin the athle@@ tics Championships that begin Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia will meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
even more in@@ adequate and forbidden trainers are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
soldiers massac@@ red soldiers in Mali
at a fun@@ eral service in Northern H@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two have been thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula of the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) , said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two inver@@ ters but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest victim , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ pt@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es Dom Saint Peter .
at noon , only the members were goodbye to the church .
after that , the fun@@ eral service took place in the circle of family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general editor of the German Army Volker Wie@@ ker .
dre@@ ad@@ ful ro@@ ses lay down ro@@ ses , and their families were arm in arm to the soles .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers pursued the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of Defense by the Le@@ yen signed the reverse soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ ili@@ pt@@ mann has built the flight operations of the tiger screw@@ driver tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Kom@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this occupation could not turn off the crash , it would not have been mistaken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubt : the UN mission in Mali was not displayed by the Le@@ yen : the mission is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high meaning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country by whom we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the fun@@ eral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are best@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants to be a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried by his wife after his death .
this was shared with the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already had a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , and it was further notice of communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French home .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a h@@ eh@@ l of that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king .
in 2016 he retired and put the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Hen@@ rik didn &apos;t get the title and the function he wanted to see himself as equivalent to his wife - also not after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said LE@@ NE B@@ alle@@ by , the Head of the Danish Royal House . &quot; &quot; &quot;
where the final resting place of the 83 year @-@ old will eventually be un@@ clear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the past 50 years .
a native of Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ ratic sex , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French Embassy at the River Thames .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy duty in his almost 50 years old reg@@ ent@@ ele in his almost 50 years old reg@@ ent@@ ele .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I was doing was critic@@ ised .
my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk cr@@ amps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and the ones in Germany had to be able to be the brand of social @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope to regard .
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to make quick re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP prior to possible majority in Lower Saxony
low @-@ fac@@ eted Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is following the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising exit of a Green @-@ de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hanover lost its full @-@ vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP .
the present Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ ails established their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CDU @-@ President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
in this way , CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the lower Sax@@ on Parliament , SPD and green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new day of land will be voted on January 14 next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government has now decided whether they could continue to rain in this situation without a majority .
Stephan Weil resi@@ des it , however , as soon as soon as soon as possible , as soon as possible , as soon as possible , as soon as possible , as soon as possible .
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the national constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament is reli@@ eved from the prime minister and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
these opportunities must be checked legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all questions if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we@@ ster@@ y step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ dic@@ ular de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country of land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we naturally assume that she has received her country house that has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the president Meta Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner together with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ IEL said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it deliber@@ ately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background that there were no content differences , we can &apos;t understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CDU as a betra@@ yal of the CDU @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the voters and voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Director of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag quickly .
the Austr@@ o @-@ west costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony is the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political scientist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past vanity and in her fru@@ stration their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ized SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is involved in this dirty play of in@@ filtr@@ ating political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tual CDU @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ist Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to embrace El@@ ke T@@ ests in the CDU .
the President of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ akes before , with personal career think the outcome of the 2013 country election .
the CDU was then in front of the SPD , the strongest force , the SPD and the Green had a very thin majority of a vote .
interview in Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from tox@@ ins , Lord Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the German Edit@@ ors Network ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states make the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if after all , what we currently know , health end@@ an@@ gering is virtually impossible .
Al@@ di now assumes the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has shut down immediately and is on the announcement of Germany &apos;s concerns in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has the same as the producer to ensure that the sold products are capable of traffic and health .
if with eggs , the resi@@ due level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , they are unable to traffic .
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and eaten .
this time not the establ@@ ishments are to blame .
are production operations and consumers in the same boat ?
according to the knowledge of knowledge , production plants affects no immediate fault .
rather , it must be due to alleged illegal practices of service companies with economic damages .
as always there is too little control in harvest .
is it lacking only on personnel or even at the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls , which have revealed the process .
however , in fact , food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded at 100 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely this is why a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and hand@@ over to the govern@@ ance in the cases in which off@@ ences may lie , of crucial importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made a number of times in times that I expect a comprehensive en@@ lighten@@ ment of the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular Alar@@ mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get only safe and busy food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumers and consumers are entitled to law .
by means of this , manufacturer , merchants and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ du@@ il at the attitude of food @-@ safe animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it must be consistently working on all levels and with high pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is bre@@ ached and highlighted perfectly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of the football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to avoid un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA still , as the executive organization , which monitors the European game , has the power to offer teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEFA in , mean that PS@@ G must point out that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses .
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to extract the Brazilian from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moved to France .
PS@@ G can make the money loose with security , in order to sign Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring it into a galaxy other stars in view of the financing of the team through the energy of rich rulers of Qatar .
publishers may apply a lot of money to purchase players , but need to control the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business to them .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEFA @-@ President in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that in their quest for success would have taken enormous debts , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners have with@@ drawn their support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P rested from concentration on debt of clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ov@@ ich originally used in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then expanded to improve the team and to build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current Thir@@ ty Years &apos; period , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell from the Presi@@ dency of the Presi@@ dency of 2015 , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to put away from excessive issues .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , leaving the case for the next five years in the amount of EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 will be held on 21 players who remain limited to normal 25 players .
the UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ look their financial statements by companies associated with owners of a club .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a cat@@ ar@@ ical company could transp@@ ose the PS@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA cannot be considered legitim@@ ate income . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsor@@ ing of PSA was b@@ anded by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar might come to Ne@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar from 2022 have argu@@ ed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar F@@ WC amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors will be out and an African man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEFA regul@@ ators could just find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G means that the UEFA is still attentive , every attempt to comply with the rules .
the UEFA had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros has achieved a gain of over 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .
PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing to sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s sign@@ ation by alleged that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finanz@@ iel@@ lem D@@ oping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to the last owner of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by American sports Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La League against a state that financed a society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of the football over the past 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial material fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
in the past few years , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y is made on board chocolate for Swiss .
now the collaboration is facing a possible end : the airline has re@@ signed the order .
Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; newspaper from Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will contract a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current suppliers Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
in addition , around 17 million small red @-@ white sh@@ og@@ g@@ ums spread over 14 grams per year the flight att@@ endant before landing to the passengers .
Swiss has not wanted to make any information about the cost .
industry @-@ sider estimate the order volume according to &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ manufacturer .
how many applicants are there with the new tender , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y the Swiss .
but only Swiss manufacturers come in question .
according to the newspaper report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y tries to make a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards spread over Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss decided to take a contract with the Mig@@ ros Dau@@ ghter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline operates with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ h@@ aul flights , the first class customers will be p@@ am@@ pered by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi of Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi also distri@@ butes the short trip to Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class .

hit against drugs m@@ af@@ ia in the country
the police is a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ B@@ aar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects are scanned , as the public pro@@ secut@@ ors hur@@ ried on Friday .
thereby , 15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and issued an arrest warran@@ ts against them .
the officials also exhibited larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros .
during the same Raz@@ or in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
members of the Mafia is accused of crimin@@ ality , severe violence , attempted murder , as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since the summer of 2016 , the public pro@@ secutor &apos;s public pro@@ secutor against organised drug traff@@ icking in the southern German region .
between the officers in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
this was therefore accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the vis@@ ier of investigations were mainly Italian nationals with respect to the Italian m@@ af@@ ia .
a incident on the 27th of May in hats , at which early in the morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , should go to the bank account .
manner lam@@ ents big g@@ aps in the fore@@ ig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not show up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the fore@@ ig@@ ner register in Germany indicates significant defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to some serious faul@@ ts on asylum procedures .
according to the approval management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , report@@ edly made attention to a media report on large g@@ aps in the foreign register register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the existing data could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious failure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; involving asylum procedures and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis that constitutes the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the register , ten million people are covered by foreign citizenship , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who have long since become a citizen , or of citizens who have become German citizens , and should not show up in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inser@@ ts can slow down recur@@ ring processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statist@@ ic for foreign people should be covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false assign@@ ments carried out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on the handling of trav@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has obviously begun to return refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they have travelled from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ snab@@ ru@@ cker Newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , the BA@@ MF lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper has been on site under reference to the difficult situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees to first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the Zealand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the reason the ministry is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the admission capacity for families with young children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the admission and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold these promises for sufficient .
other EU countries would also send refugees back in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic policy spokes@@ woman of the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten the lack of admission under the Italian asylum system of human rights and a end@@ an@@ gering of child care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of people living in Ober@@ fran@@ enbach was already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by Jürgen Gre@@ ule who has now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
traditionally , the municipality in the meeting of the Municipal Council confirms the read@@ iness of read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is awesome as our body is created for it and we care the sp@@ asses that their blood are available for strangers , nor in@@ trin@@ sic &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the preser@@ ves are broken into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three persons could benefit from a bleeding .
at the same time , corn makers published by the actions taken in the spring of Ober@@ reich@@ enbach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have ste@@ amed the spec@@ ulation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when they were added to family interest rates in the middle of an increased pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , in this month fewer members increased an increase , because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for increasing growth .
in its quar@@ terly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on the budget will continue , and inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is necessary that interest in the next few years would be necessary in raising the inflation of Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs would possibly increase more than expected in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth business package which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will require time to provide cheap funding for banks in order to provide more budget funding from the next February that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billions of Po@@ unds Sterling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short term because the pressure on the real@@ ities of households continues to increase consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the interest rates it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain stream@@ lining of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger scale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary as the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently predicted the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the adjusted growth progn@@ osis of the Bank for this and next year , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has retained its growth forecast for 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell by the dollar , compared to the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the latest dis@@ appointing growth figures have sub@@ du@@ ed the increasing expectations on a rate of interest and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to recover at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover from the end of the year .
the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and minor re@@ mun@@ ities , since the pro@@ vocation becomes even worse , before they become better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income gap &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages in the end of their thirty @-@ year forecast will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to weak pounds , resulting in a proportion of lower consumer spending .
the decision comes up a year after lower@@ ing of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote caused by the sin@@ king of the coup .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until they will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
prior to the last judgment of the Bank to interest rates , the call had increased after an interest rate , as the inflation increased the pressure on hard pushed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the bank said that this was expected to be put back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 % &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to its goal is to be entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Co@@ rec@@ o mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market should be competitive again , because the credit@@ or would like to stop shops and finish the year in a positive manner .
the market is particularly good for those who run out the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) is to promote the controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transformation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV pre@@ ventive treatment from September to a fight against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ resolution phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infections in high risk factors by around 86 percent , is now delivered by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , that the N@@ HS had to pay in spite of the asser@@ tion that local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ chief Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the application of people , and further clinics will follow in October 2018 before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ positi@@ positi@@ phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV medicine that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in risk of infection .
pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
to those who come in question are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who were not treated successfully .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a house@@ doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ cu@@ rement .
the study aims to assess the total potential of Pr@@ EP by evalu@@ ating clinical evidence as demonstrated in a large scale , absorbed and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far reaching and over@@ taking successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in dealing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , when focused on needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument which is really individually controlled and is not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority has to be realized that the study will quickly be carried out throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test medicine was provided , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sharon Hodg@@ son , shadow @-@ health minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due for months and delay .
the evidence show how to transform this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and the transfer of these lifel@@ ong infection can end .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living life : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment to a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne had not packed her bags and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I sought something similar to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a closed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add to Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage room and a mezz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan A@@ adi from Notting Hill to make a 12.5 @-@ foot high ceilings and create a home not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand .
the fan had to think creative to solve the award .
&quot; the steel works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were persu@@ aded to each other , without that we had to g@@ aps . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezz@@ anine a classic copper window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down across the glam@@ orous living area .
mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program .
the use of mirrors play a role when adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to cause him longer .
in the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units offer space for all the best and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineering thing went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of stainless steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that if you move the door up , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base surface - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here they managed to enlarge the floor area , and simultaneously use high quality materials that provide the room its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and they therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you into electric outlets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meter of something that can be transformed into something completely natural .
in fact , how Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not .
brothers fight for a 500 million dollar real estate in the property
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the greatest real estate imperi@@ alist Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football Club &apos; and developer Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and power will be divided .
Paul wanted to retreat from family business since 2014 , but a sharp confron@@ tation about the separation occurs in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna , brothers 38 have accumulated in value of more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family in 1973 bought a store in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now comprises offices in the city center , the areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the subur@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin - by Paul has described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; principal operators and domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a judicial acts says that Colin has property worth $ 316 million and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars worth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those of Colin proposed resolutions have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in an first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed hearing , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place .
the brothers now fight for the control of the existing business - of which Colin how Paul claims to have excluded him .
Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but Paul throws himself to manage some poss@@ essions .
in an early ap@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Colin , he says he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian legacy is written that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held lawyer .
Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , operated in milk bars and del@@ icacy operations from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ venti@@ es .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in Colin first opened the family in Colin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Colin says that he began to bear West@@ co there when he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of the De Lut@@ is Group , where Colin claims that mark was paid by the company $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colin has kept himself very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 , Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax media met Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad , very sad that my brother Paul decided to complain about and put our sur@@ names through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he was still looking for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , these hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our matter will be resolved in the near future of the courts , &quot; Colin wrote .
Tr@@ umps of new staff of Staff is planning to limit media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and have failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow to President tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of rep@@ orter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , at his first working day with executive staff , he introduced a major problem in president Donald Tr@@ ump of White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that come into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to counter tr@@ ump by monitoring its media di@@ ligence .
President Tr@@ ump On TV goes back for decades - and now , where he &apos;s in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed by un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were persu@@ aded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former electoral consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February opposite POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to stick to Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps has ever been &quot; under control &quot; was ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these camp@@ sites know something that we do not know other - that Tr@@ umps twe@@ ets have not included more combust@@ ible material without inter@@ ventions .
we will probably never experience something about Twe@@ ets that has not sent tr@@ ump .
if his staff had made it a few times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has to prevent it consistently , that tr@@ ump check out contro@@ vers@@ y .
part of the problem is that people sit together in a white house that prepar@@ es itself out of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by supporting tr@@ ump material , which perhaps promotes their views from the world .
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - dealing with this story - reported in May on the pre@@ ference of advis@@ er to access the President of strategic reasons .
this was an example described by the Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump @-@ officers say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press coverage , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he sti@@ ff@@ ened to find out how they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just this happened at the end of February , when someone mal@@ ign@@ ant accused a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of Internet Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Stab@@ ili@@ zer K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , to be the source behind a pile to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; at the White House .
although Johnson has been banned from Twitter because he has no specific evidence or that he expressed false accus@@ ations and rep@@ lic@@ ted them in the past .
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former staff of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly is trying three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be more effective as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his coun@@ sel@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Master of searched crimin@@ als to get post by Europ@@ ol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped .
the police all over Europe were ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to the dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
since the addresses of specific crimin@@ als are not known , evidence of the population will be hoping for and pray .
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the promotion , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from the winter .
the experiences could have shown that many fle@@ eing from holiday dest@@ in@@ ations , it was called Europ@@ ol .
one has compiled 21 postcards for selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ east@@ erly , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online but@@ chers have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them are due to the publication on the website .
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aires series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined passengers on the foot of war , which have taken out of the municipality drawn by the church in order to rec@@ ti@@ fy a field in front of their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a weal@@ thy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aires series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies , and an army of gra@@ fts , after being thrown out in May , without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch to prevent their sei@@ zu@@ res .
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were moved on Monday evening after being sent to Bentley He@@ ath where they have thrown stones to the pass@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Council must be forced by shame on implementation into action , as he was useless when dealing with the problem .
the travelers were there in May , were moved and are now back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to manage to protect long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy when the Council can &apos;t stop this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridi@@ culous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and one even saw a horse in the park . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are conscious of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to support our proof collection , it is very important that as many locals call an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police , by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we propose our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house in front of the Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts gates is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof farm by the then ambi@@ ence of operating company GmbH , on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and revenue from the local tax .
in autumn 2014 , in the fall of 2014 , increasing numbers of refugees , which came to the district , offered the hotel building of the country house as a collective accommodation , provided for controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by the establishment of a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disp@@ uted in the council at that time .
but especially the Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel site and already spoke of serious buyers in the house .
he should keep right .
the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star rating category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter facility .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof there have been a long time building container before the entrance , and when you enter the house , what extensive renovation works will be made .
the floors were torn out , ceilings to partially dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ es from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a only building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input field is re@@ designed , there will be new windows .
everything that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting space belong to the equipment .
it would not be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a higher inner level , emphas@@ ises Sch@@ erer .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approx . 60 rooms will be show@@ cas@@ ed down , sh@@ erer further .
both individual holidays , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel .
convers@@ ations with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Krau@@ se already managed so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer would not want to be precise .
under a million euros , he expects .
the grounds are also obvious in front of the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freud &apos;s city is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : U.S. Special Repres@@ ent@@ atives sets the Grand Jury
in the Russia affair to U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , special agent Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the Panel took up work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; referring to the subject of trusted persons .
the paper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expands and intensi@@ fied its investigations .
the Sender CNN reported that there is already first pre @-@ inv@@ itations of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since longer , targeted to the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether they were off@@ ended between Tr@@ umps campaigns and Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are to stand up in the election campaign as an advisor of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a couple of weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump wrote in the center and search the accus@@ ation , whether the president may have hin@@ dered justice in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ gen is to examine and decide the evidence of possible cases and to decide whether they should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called count chambers .
they are generally switched on when it is bigger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to charge people under E@@ id .
according to the transmitter CNN have already been exhibited inci@@ dentally , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked about a statement , was it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ umps and son in law Jar@@ ed K@@ ush@@ ner and his former electoral manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in conversation with him .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in US television that Mu@@ eller should not be inti@@ mi@@ dated in his work and that he should be necessary to deal with quickly .
however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charges of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the ab@@ mi@@ um of a new phase in exam@@ inations and a new reason to concern the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new dis@@ closure , the president used a speech in West Virginia in order to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theme give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

but they usually work in the obe@@ dience , he emphas@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ate any measures that acceler@@ ates the work of the special service to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I would not be determined against the President .
one has no reason to assume that something changed in it , was it further in the declaration .
Mu@@ eller was only used when Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
because of this gro@@ w@@ ling , accus@@ ations had become noisy , he wanted to hin@@ der justice .
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him about setting the investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under enormous pressure due to the investigation .
according to the US media , the White House gathered material against the special agent and his staff .
the dis@@ b@@ anded spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller released .
unlike an independent special agent of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate Aff@@ air around the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could be fired in theory at the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of rep@@ ubli@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators issued on Thursday , according to which the special medi@@ ator could not be dismissed anymore .
Antarc@@ tica : giant ice@@ berg drives in Antarc@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ is , a giant ice@@ berg has solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this year , the Bremer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the distance between one tr@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square @-@ kilometer large Kol@@ oss then desc@@ ends to the north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
it is 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest giant giant , the researchers have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
to what extent , climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice@@ berg , is un@@ clear after research .
in total , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ qu@@ arri@@ es in the region since about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be associated with global warming .
now the broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow towards the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula .
North of this shift was the equilibrium of wax and dis@@ rup@@ ting some years ago .
a complete sh@@ el@@ fe@@ at is falling there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the front edge has never with@@ drawn away as far as currently .
in addition , the iron plate stands under tension and can dis@@ integrate if at a key place a piece breaks .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and Eis@@ berg will not increase sea level , as they swim on the water and p@@ ushes the ice as much water as it yields for the melting itself .
however , the loss of shame caused the gl@@ ac@@ iers directly into the sea and can flow faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project becomes the observation of the Antarc@@ tic ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is the fourth largest shadow fe@@ ather with almost 50 000 square kilometers .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural history and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ice plate is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; confirmed also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists should be controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will be back and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
even if these researchers do not withdraw the demol@@ ition of this giant ice@@ berg in the past few decades , however , many ic@@ el@@ ites of the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula can be destroyed .
this long summit of Antarc@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antarc@@ tic Survey , the area of Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the temperature increase has contributed to decline .
the Antarc@@ tic Peninsula has risen by around three degrees in the past 50 years and thus counting the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CDU wants to receive pets at personnel
because it is becoming more difficult to occupy vac@@ ancies , the CDU , from the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag 41 opened new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officers work for the management administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very cov@@ eted .
around 620 applications were recorded for the places listed in this year .
however , the circle continues to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at the moment , there are M@@ ett@@ mann &apos;s circle , as in front of 50 un@@ occupied places .
among other things , physi@@ cians and engineers , as well as forces of general administration are sought .
the CDU would like to take the initiative in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG had to take part in the administration .
the administration is supposed to provide a concept for recru@@ itment and personal development after the desire of the parties . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term conditions of skilled workers , but future @-@ proof of candidates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers , demanding a training session , challenge CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems you previously did not know .
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is from a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Competition of Public Emplo@@ yers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , a high number of employees , the disease , or age @-@ related , comes from the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the highest time to act so do not remain un@@ occupied anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , President of the CDU , goes beyond his party with his party .
he looked already in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a f@@ low@@ ly surprise when he publicly presented the pay@@ pal publicly in question and the remaining parties flour@@ ished .
people want all the possibilities to be verified , which allow an exit from the municipal utility association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution here , the circle administration should be with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ members - a pet tariff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says nations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CDU , the employees and officials will try to pay better than fore@@ sees the tariff for public@@ ity .
the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements or more money is available only if you are changing into a higher level that is gear@@ ed to professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew increasingly in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the new Pro@@ stitute Act .
not least through the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Far@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ directors Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy shar@@ pen@@ ed the tone for mig@@ rant @-@ mig@@ rat@@ ory boats
Italy has NGOs that are using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue , if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organization &quot; youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth R@@ uler &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because their crew had effectively worked with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that lighten@@ ed the illegal immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express themselves to detailed proposals of the Italian State forest Amb@@ ro@@ gio Cart@@ osi@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can assess all accus@@ ations currently collected , just as we collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities watched the boat of &apos; youth R@@ attle &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , monitored since October .
it is assumed that his crew will take hose @-@ boat migrants aboard , which can take them directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can drive again , so that the ships can be used again .
at least such a meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of State of State , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of referring to the authority of Italian coast@@ guards , ambul@@ ances in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not monitors any other motives .
under the code of conduct boats must have boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta above all , an Italian police officer , who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential amendments or Dis@@ abilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their life inter@@ actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation , Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti said today that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy have declined sharp@@ ly in the last few weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the strengthening of Libyan coastline and the cooperation with local civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had plans for further talks with Libyan people in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that have left these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
ascent and Tri@@ als
nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berliner Foreign Office &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Trieste and sights .
three be@@ friend@@ ete guides stood for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for touring .
the castle and wine festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of the Micha@@ el@@ sk@@ ap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed observation points , partly on towers , from which one could reach far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the urban planes .
in between there was always a longer ascent , for the long tri@@ als reward .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .

after 173 kilometers and nearly 4,@@ 500 meters , the group had the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best side - sporty and cul@@ tur@@ ally - met .
console instead of grass - Bundesliga is preparing for e @-@ sport
sitting the Sport @-@ Stars in the future of computer consoles , instead of getting through the weather and weather about the stadium @-@ shaving ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious industry to become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages including .
this also recognized the first state aver@@ aver@@ s that increasingly engage in this field .
the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sports Department in mid @-@ July and adopted two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to am@@ aze a completely new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some clubs are asc@@ ending on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , FIFA World Cup FIFA in London organis@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; with which Gam@@ er will compete in various clubs .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V Eindhoven have qualified for example .
also Robin D@@ utt looks great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer from Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football must be apart from 14 to 30 years old , that the young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sport@@ s@@ men under contract , you could be present online far more often on these markets than once in the year the federal lig@@ am@@ ship to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; with e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League of Legends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or just the FIFA simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long as in normal sports , Li@@ gen established themselves , in which the pros compete against each other .
and with the Asian Games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the performance is sure to get used .
Ingo F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he &apos;s competent and many biological and physical reactions that one can also find in classic sport - for example increased heart rate , stress action , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise at the console , but also exercise their body and respect the diet .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y also sees problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more on a topic . &quot;
checks are difficult to perform at online games and in the scene failed the structures of the classic Sports .
the scientist highlights the high integ@@ rative effect of E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the road , which is like a large global family , there is no inter@@ cultural shirt .
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federation of inter@@ active maintenance software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the e @-@ sport a rapid growth .
in 2016 , there were 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments .
in three years , sales of 130 million are expected .
this is little about 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writing the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
International are many countries already far@@ ther .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ basketball h@@ oop Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez have been taking part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as teaching , the rob@@ ber@@ y says .
in the Netherlands and in France the football @-@ first @-@ league clubs are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; explains , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B management board R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nost@@ al@@ gia would fall , and the old times clari@@ fy , today no more is enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company is simultaneously hosting the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t stick to it that only in football everything remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , urged Conrad Roy to have committed suicide
one woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boyfriend and calls for suicide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her convic@@ tion behind guitar@@ ists and five years were suspended on request .
Carter was condemned in June because of the killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ tr@@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his vocation .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but its legal representatives argu@@ ed that both they suffered as Mr Roy at a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , folded with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions brought to Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the lawyer in judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has shown no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters a lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or rub@@ bing or even her mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother &apos;s Lyn@@ n Roy who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t smoke the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to bear in spite of all my pain that we are going to be with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy said that she will never be persecuted by knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she will never be able to participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no more this only person with whom I was together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will always keep on with me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask for another person to claim suicide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters &apos;s text@@ books revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; Hän@@ g you spring , spring from a building , create yourself , I know not , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent over the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you must do is turning the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they can benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few others defended Carter Knox , who was sentenced to Italy in 2007 because of the murder of their British co @-@ resident in Italy before she was acquitted of two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ i : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua K@@ int@@ i was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup , is no co@@ incidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern won a big season for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ fed Cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something was different on his place in the cabin , that Joshua saw C@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small .
but as far as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups there was of course no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neuer could be seen , he made himself a ha@@ de to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner told , after his first deployment as Bayern captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the coach was able to suggest K@@ imm@@ i too .
not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen out of youth players , de@@ but@@ s , and just out of the vacation , existing C @-@ El@@ f were chosen as a game guide , but he .
sugar@@ l is best distributed to those , to whom you want a lot to do with you .
who , therefore , was chosen to enter the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what you want as a player to take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m .
on the right side , which is now its position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did its rest .
and at all , K@@ int@@ ich worked in this start @-@ up like the one who can take the ru@@ der also best in the hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the tro@@ upe tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole , while many others were busy himself .
V@@ idal is thus trying to over@@ ride his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil , come back to the services of Asia @-@ trip ( but also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this after all worked quite well .
Sü@@ le ran beside K@@ imm@@ i , Rud@@ y before the defense , both were sovereig@@ n .
the well occupied Nap@@ oli storm was very difficult , in addition , Sü@@ le tried to succeed in playing a couple of times as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y proved that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Not so , as we hoped it would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at the debut .
game siege , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
as usual , this Bavaria @-@ world is still for new additions , one saw in connection to the game .
for example , Rud@@ y was not one or two interviews in the Cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but also six or seven interviews .
K@@ imm@@ i said goodbye after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here , I already noticed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you just have to win any game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .

it was often im@@ plac@@ eable , the relationship between the land and regional economy , as Ev@@ eline Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , was still Minister of State of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is based on more than one year , in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .

Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ als ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of sol@@ st@@ ice looks at Nat@@ us in infrastructure policies : the bridge circuit of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top priority list of the country .
this year , the Ministry is hoping for planning a planning process until 2021 .
the western part of the country also plays a role in the plans of the country , which stands in the ob@@ tru@@ sive requirement of the federal state of traffic .
the aim is to put the route in operation in December 2020 , says the Minister of Foreign Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us is looking for a sign@@ post to support regional , but international competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce ( N@@ HK ) , Trier , is stim@@ ulated by the wine of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label to increase the sales in Super@@ markets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years .

Audi is to change 8@@ 50.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a counter action
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options as travel restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and thus went to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based - to offer or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday to modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , systems for neutr@@ alising the gases to install from diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , take also what it makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to cover the powerful auto companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regul@@ ate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that have been able to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
in the past month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be found in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused Audi to have installed a system to deal the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to load Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer is over@@ proportional to the Volkswagen win .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
the Is@@ ar visitors also carry a raft by Munich on Saturday , which has a special message on Saturday .
if it moves to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft there , between Fl@@ au@@ cher and Reich@@ enb@@ ach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not an exercise raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists .
but the building reference wants to clari@@ fy .
on the raft one sees a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ens and the laughter of suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published cartoon illustr@@ ator , the rab@@ bits of his statues are its trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ in@@ ier is still showing and works on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he was among others as a dra@@ fts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation . - what fru@@ str@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , at the end of the 60 &apos;s breakthrough : with the release of his cart@@ oons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again , the artists of cities were inspired .
big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures meet in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits on the drawing day , almost ten hours a day .
about calendars , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches still find lots of spread throughout the world .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
the main man in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any favourite animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ si@@ ders as counter@@ players .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which should get back to the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what they are saying , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which is how its original drawings will be produced .
lav@@ ender from Provence , threatened by climate change
he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the lav@@ ender is remin@@ is@@ cent of the conditions due to d@@ rought and due to the diseases , resear@@ ching scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has brought down the effects of climate change , which has much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there &apos;s a lot on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only lu@@ red for holidays , it is also very asked for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said , &quot; instead of very long plant guns with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
to the solutions that are taken into consideration are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration in the soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thur@@ ing@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 years of existence .

killing a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for the reporting of the youngest chaos in the state of Sin@@ al@@ oa , organised crime , corrupt civil and unc@@ eas@@ ing drug wars .
but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or let them go home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponent , neutr@@ ale , ally .
they ask the rep@@ orter , names for each column - no evidence is needed , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal feelings .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of government or cart@@ el , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico .
there are no rest periods from violence , and while in all the country the cor@@ p@@ ses , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 , ever since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to , in December 2012 , there have been at least seven dead in seven states in this year .
among the latter is their editor and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply experienced , although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; it depends on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , wearing T @-@ Shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and rep@@ orters discuss their shared issues , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the prosecution was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it has led only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as with most thousands of Mor@@ den , who are linked every year with drug traff@@ icking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely asked .
in Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they are still strug@@ gling to treat the violence of Sin@@ al@@ oa , even though it is un@@ comfor@@ ting , even though the terrain is still tra@@ itor .
without information on the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we don &apos;t miss them all . &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital city of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was shot from his car and was shot for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the Schüt@@ ze drove away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there are virtually nothing to be silent .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in the past year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ al@@ oa was one of the country &apos;s bloody batt@@ le@@ fields to fight , since rival fra@@ ctions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ al@@ oa , one day or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of ench@@ anting , two @-@ storey maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug makers who are larger than many houses for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ on has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , is broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
at first there was publication of a interviews with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival Cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may be anno@@ yed by the sons , who bought gang@@ sters bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were shipped to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second fault was to force Val@@ dez , after the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues decided that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced rep@@ orter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he merged with five colleagues to the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars in hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ al@@ oa , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the smo@@ ven@@ om problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the time , the paper served a reputation for cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and sales and advertising .
rep@@ orters fell , hard to publish hard studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , where he always led them .
he gave up voluntarily to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ al@@ oa is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must take over the task which falls to you as a journalist - either you or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done about so many sco@@ oter ? why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce @-@ Team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird that could curse the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice was a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table .
now ask them : was his love for routine practice ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death also urged them to ask their own advice about how they can do their job best and stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ profess@@ orship and self maintenance .
his own inst@@ inc@@ ts trust .
if it sm@@ ells false , stay away .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the cause with Javier is happening . &quot;
the old rules , such as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ al@@ oa no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling rou@@ ten , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees met from Ri@@ odo@@ ce to the security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively on governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen found protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , whom the Governor itself was not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
it is months ago since the rep@@ orter has gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug @-@ bound are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has blocked three main stories .
it was the assassination of the former famous Box@@ er Julio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ al@@ oa .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the public spending , focused on the town &apos;s home town .
and there was a group in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite site of drug retailers and authorities .
a rep@@ orter knew from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost all the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ kar@@ mic cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the rep@@ orter to write about previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of the ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication is broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers who are protest@@ ing against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the staff had become something that they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
rep@@ orter Miri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ apped up a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the office of the At@@ tor@@ ney .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists have become more loud in all country by writing &quot; SOS Press &quot; in organized protests and buildings .
on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez was gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ al@@ oa on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and to destroy them , because they have said the truth .
she has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is worried that their rage has viol@@ ated their objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were organised by organised crime , participating government officials and a similar society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug musicians , but also on command of politicians and security forces , with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you die because they &apos;d like to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one eats the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in northern borders of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was report@@ edly signed by the Z@@ etas by Kartell , &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lay in addition to its separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the El Nor@@ te newspaper in the northern border state Ch@@ ihu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez set up publicly on the site map with an editorial on the introduction &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fled from their home states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and search for dangers .
and sometimes they are ch@@ ased away as it was evi@@ den@@ ced by the photographer of Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who continue to stay and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives to that the drug traff@@ icking him terri@@ fied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and so I was rep@@ orter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ mon .
a series of shooting paintings with rib@@ bed v@@ als and security forces close to the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort , 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued , as promised by a series of Kartell &apos;s messages in the region .
from the boarding edge , you published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the front@@ page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - a further shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , who stopped to see if they were in read@@ iness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ al@@ oa , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed its traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In the same day that Javier was murdered , inter@@ ns asked me to send them to reporting on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to devi@@ ate his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , even if a fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ racy of a Canadian min@@ ers have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his own skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they could have had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the be@@ aded din@@ osau@@ rs ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserv@@ ative state has expl@@ aining it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mo@@ red plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
he met something that sh@@ out from the surrounding rocks on the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more closely .
the F@@ ossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth cl@@ umps .
after all this hard work the final result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only blind a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it &apos;s sleeping , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found out that this plant fres@@ ser , although it is covered with arm@@ or and is similar to a changing shell , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide in front of space , and used a par@@ agli@@ ding that is known as counter@@ f@@ att@@ ening , which is also used by many modern animals .
this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to devi@@ ate its enemies , say experts what it indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document patterns and the form of sheds and arm@@ aments over his body .
she discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature dar@@ ker was dar@@ ker than its base .
although the cont@@ empl@@ ation is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , by far the living animals survi@@ ving today .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was driven by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the confron@@ tation as a means of survival was fav@@ oured .
but most of contemporary animals , which use the sh@@ ady condition - think about deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ dles - are much smaller and vulner@@ able than prey that this nost@@ al@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ dents of the chal@@ k must have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r bay was .
scientists continue to examine the animal on his life , including its conservative Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it eaten as its last meal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , came into a river , and pushed into the sea , where he sank to the sea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time Alberta was as warm as South Fle@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread across inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ated skin but also in three dimensions will remain and the original form of the animal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks like in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you just like a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ al period was a time when huge ther@@ o@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the king of them , Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavier monster .
the scientists , their latest findings in journal Current Biology seem to believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was disp@@ at@@ ched after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ ified in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b .
according to the museum it is the be@@ held din@@ osau@@ rs in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was w@@ led by Western Canada until a flooded river was flooded into open sea .
but the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ r preser@@ ves his arm@@ or in exquis@@ itely item detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special copy are so good that the skin will always cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured panels along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael Gre@@ sh@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y tank panels , which carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed upwards .
I can count the sheds at his sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
hot accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass amb@@ res .
there are numerous verses , kilomet@@ ers@@ long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on Thursday afternoon , Thursday afternoon , some 20 people were injured .
following the first information of the police were at 17.00 hrs between the connectors Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( District of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm , under 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , inter@@ c@@ annon .
there is no information about the exact number of the injured editions .
it is about moderate to moderate injuries , said a police force .
a large array of rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A8 was completely locked towards Munich .
in the direction of Munich , some ten kilometres long retreat was formed .
like a AZ rep@@ orter , it also came on the way to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched itself the number plate of drivers which now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and car .
a rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced : nothing wrong is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ gen@@ ious thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the conductor and awak@@ ens an uns@@ us@@ ement , or strike the rest in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creation @-@ free ticket control .
one is simply confirmed by mobile phone that it is taken up and evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; the offer is , we extend it out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the train ticket dev@@ alu@@ ation without Schaff@@ ner .
in order to be able to use , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and lastly , you need a seating set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : you asc@@ end to the train , calls his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for electronic recovery .
the train accompanying you get a message on your mobile devices that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the seat seat Y .
the train accompanied by the ticket inspection at No. Y knows that there is a passenger with an already value online ticket .
so you can continue sleeping , continue working , keep silent .
the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which is to use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to travel without ticket inspection through our train cabin , check out the DB Navigator for yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables passengers to create their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing board of DB remote traffic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel train knows that in addition to delay and pas@@ sions , the ticket controls are among the biggest nu@@ ances .
for often , in any case , one of the participants does not have all documents which you need for dev@@ alu@@ ation of online tickets .
either the credit card or ID card or ID card or document must be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between mig@@ rant and passenger , which leads to worse sen@@ timent in the waste or large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and take the conductor at the end time to take care of other concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nor can only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has just killed 18 years old , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly praying on its tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed live .
he posted a picture of bro@@ s le@@ she@@ er body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell said to her .
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she put her cell phone in order later to return to Twe@@ ets on Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos from the police book and people who cried , and from a man who claimed to be bro@@ ker &apos;s father , who bore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feed , when a polic@@ eman stood before a group of protest@@ ers with a bar@@ king dog .
in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell re@@ minded of her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and which we can call us typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cinemas from 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and power , the strength and resistance of resistance , which live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rell contributed to her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m and organisation , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience c@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is no different than the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was transferred to a camp@@ ground as the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and hal@@ ves them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began to take a new type of ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m for Fer@@ rell shape .
&quot; my ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ se Association and concentrated on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black commun@@ es .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said they and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to document , &quot; what happened .
a question came to Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; would you document or try to find a story you can explo@@ it ? &quot;
this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis for an artist from the field that is known for his ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m around death .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rell to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak , Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are displayed , as I will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Messi@@ ah &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement , but for a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; Un@@ surprising personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , as she married in love and married her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , laughed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work and for the understanding of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have influenced the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Martin in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
black , gay women must bear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; fol@@ ay@@ an voted to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , she insist@@ ed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is no affir@@ m@@ ist type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when Fer@@ rell has chosen their identity as a heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who shook her energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no co@@ incidence although it was on fore@@ front , because in a life on these cros@@ sings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the assembly and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rell is for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she describes the social and social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , she cla@@ ve himself to a song and she feels committed to this memory since three years ago she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on on the street .
&quot; it is our duty to fight our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV readers discussing bits @-@ gallery
the bit Gallery moves people , although it is still not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre on the south side of the pedestrian zone spl@@ its since the first presentation of 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
hardly anything makes the subject very cold .
the theme is also discussed on our Facebook page , &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one @-@ bit gallery say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be really great &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Becker ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t need man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ uss ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the advoc@@ ates are building that a gallery has more customers in the city , while the rest of the business will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
added : the Gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmers market stands , in which 13 direct market will provide its products .
it will end with the start of construction .
the Gallery M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land@@ wives are always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct market is in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why purchasing the shopping experience in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , Dro@@ ger@@ - or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of that in our city .
you can see how many shop transactions are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market stands remain .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mainly offered by the producer and is ob@@ end@@ purely cheap .
as you see , shop transactions are hired in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the rentals are often not acceptable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , special business there are almost no more and what is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle fit for me not .
and the gallery does not fit Bit@@ burg .
above all : where is the farmers market place during the construction period ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - also on duration , if the bit Gallery is actually actually coming .
or does it create the ghost bit gallery before , to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery .
but it &apos;s no place for a farmers market thanks to the crazy many - how I find - sensu@@ al building projects in Bit@@ burg no more place .
when the farmers market is captured , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ aware of the same - that hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ach and hair@@ cuts that were sent to you by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st made a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after it publicly made diplomatic reports on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ blan@@ ce ( A matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and pione@@ ering dis@@ sident , whose condem@@ nation was converted to Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorithm created by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , such as someone could look like this genom@@ ic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been convicted of the identification as woman , but was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013 , including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft .
the prison was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in the Mann@@ ing sits on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ inum , which she has been associated with .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
therein produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cig@@ ars and che@@ wing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste , to produce a picture of it , as these people might look like .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg in a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not see at that time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were sent out to un@@ equal w@@ ishing , which resulted in several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Comic &quot; Support Images , &quot; which would predi@@ ct a future in which the president would like chel@@ ated judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy gathering .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to det@@ ach the rigid sp@@ ans , which he should actually go further .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in one on the wall of the Gallery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; written by her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic ri@@ spl@@ inter@@ ing , their foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , hoping to show the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological respects , we all are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people will hopefully take away from it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care about who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective it is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so are the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the mentioned Comic @-@ Nov@@ elle .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she pop@@ s up with a hands in the hands of the United States , like King Kong .
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your words , they have won , &quot; it says .
&quot; so we never put the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps if I speak about that . &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition still - as it was fore@@ seen in the comic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulations , which coinci@@ des like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers .
that was also targeted , as all in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing st@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ lo@@ id were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , who formed themselves with Chelsea , as the movement which was behind their liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and a member of the University of Oxford for the killing
a nation@@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which was sought as susp@@ ects , after a man had been caught in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts due to its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents tell that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ ls .
a general warning system was published by the Chicago Police Administration , that the ly@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victims with several injuries in his body .

Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em could now be arrested and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter that is investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates at this study , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Som@@ erv@@ ille College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in touch with the police in contact and ready to help us to assist the US investig@@ ative authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the testimony added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were sho@@ cked and wanting he himself .
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he demanding the susp@@ ects to ask the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police has an idea of her place , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received a straight tip that had something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as a very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it is un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim and explo@@ res a variety of mot@@ if@@ s , including a possible sound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian leader Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria in the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of ful@@ fil@@ ment of the criteria of road@@ map R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the WA@@ DA schedule was updated in this regard , &quot; explains Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented the second part of the road@@ map of WA@@ DA to comply with Code , which describes the criteria for re@@ viewing of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organisation .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia to concern himself .
&quot; everything was announced , everything will be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities have announced the reported results of the ruling by the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to a state @-@ supported d@@ oping d@@ oping in Russian sports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the examination because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has inserted a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit what does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has un@@ conditional to accept this report , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA from implementing d@@ oping controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has moved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the right direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell any eggs anymore
they shared the group of companies .
there are a mere precau@@ tionary measure , there could be no imp@@ air@@ ment of any health imp@@ air@@ ment , it was in communication .
from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative for fi@@ rep@@ il@@ able anti @-@ noise .
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company will not become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to compete with your fellow worker at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Madison Re@@ ed .
she called people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ sen to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it enables companies to provide surveys , surveys and demo@@ graphic groups to deal with respon@@ dents and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to deal with the C @-@ Suite managers and directly turn to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure members .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that displays most complaints and which exec@@ u@@ tives will have low intake results - so that you can drill for , why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you do not have to publish the next u@@ ber who has published a blog post in sc@@ and@@ als , which describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken were punished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
global govern@@ ance , regulation and compliance industry may own more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion , according to the financial technical website let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior and saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
converting has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla .
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , makes Conver@@ cent company tail@@ or @-@ made &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys to gather confidential responses in real @-@ time and view the warmth maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , which allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion cap@@ tures the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ically acting , it can experience costly consequences through consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , worker flight fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , has Conver@@ tible for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and processes and have an easy way to achieve its corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an inti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ YS General Coun@@ sel , who said it was no good chance to track the complaints of employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , because the company &apos;s converting speed can be hidden , which had previously been buried in offices in cities or countries , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or incomplete inter@@ ns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who direc@@ ts the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment lit@@ ig@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collapsed because of ethnic violations through the Enron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and loading the company with recur@@ ring charges for use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which will support both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , increasing capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , in view of the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only missions .
the staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are glad to be in a company , feel the work that you do is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which is both Conver@@ tible and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
when the Analytics tools third promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee &apos;s commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the manager of a company sei@@ ze no action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have a expect@@ ation that change is on the way .
and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this can stim@@ ulate dis@@ appoint@@ ments and employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask 4,000 questions , you must be willing to have 4,000 convers@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to be very much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hab@@ its you really hear me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about why should I take ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Madison Re@@ ed , who now passes monthly employees , was able to initi@@ ate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t .
and after collecting the feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company always maintains new insights on the staff , and it hopes for a long term that leads to a better binding of workers in a sector which is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you will lose customers too .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fra@@ ins
it goes on at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new practice fields of the team on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of this team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer cur@@ ses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final checks before they return on the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ man Football Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the next three days a real tre@@ k mill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 should start to meet the already complete schedule of players .
the combination away from the two days is more than one day , at which the brood moved almost one week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play times in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are to hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the start of formal preparations for the kick off against Texas A &amp; M in September .
MOR@@ A said that he supports the control change of N@@ CAA , even if they add another point to the many @-@ time routes of the player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous burden for three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just have done it , they plac@@ ements themselves , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will finish its practices once the camp is finished , in view of the clear vision of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the higher class , which is already covered with foot balls , which will be a safety net behind a gate , no easy task .
brood players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a proved to be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people will rent a room there and then you can adjust to a exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video and exercise of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I &apos;m not worried about my big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against counter@@ feit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ feit banknotes by third parties and their results in the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it &apos;s one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news .
the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to detect possible counter@@ feit detection and to send them to fac@@ tual checks that may display results of the fac@@ simile test from the original article .
Facebook was critic@@ ized as one of the main participation points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , of which many believe that they also have influenced the 2016 presidential election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , where the French voters were flooded with false stories in May , and Germany will support a plan according to social media networks , if it does not succeed to eliminate h@@ asser@@ tive Post@@ ings as before the elections there in September quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement to German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany a review of the new facts review will be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the realization , which stories of fac@@ ten@@ ders will be challenged by fac@@ tions , people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions concerning what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , product manager for fac@@ ebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continue to test his feature in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feeds to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ p@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ 1980 .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the ir@@ l River valley in K@@ ent and is now the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan area of Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents .
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; spann@@ ed the time from Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac handle@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b print on the side of a letter that was written by a double room in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b print !
and he always smell after smoke , because at that time a fire was ign@@ ited because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the od@@ or has an effect as if he himself would be .
Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who defeated so with old papers , he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To be honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) it seems to be too nice to be true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vic@@ tor@@ ian &quot; new &quot; castle , to view the archives and study the many treasures and cur@@ i@@ dities of the castle , such as the mon@@ stro@@ us heads of the castle and the bottles that have spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with fellow country@@ men , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
then , he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust got the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ am , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des hit a decade later , the employee began to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ oc@@ rats said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could mean that country tiles would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch for the two families fought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go to his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a ri@@ ot who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des .
&quot; the peas@@ ant started in this area and I thought , a rebellion is a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected to each other ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it commander , that the Dar@@ rell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , presented in the 18th century s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell , who filled his own fun@@ eral , filled with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentle@@ men seemed quite a g@@ aun@@ t , always make debts and money for things that they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men put their debt crises as married to rich old women - I place them as a bunch of looking boys , with a talent to advert@@ ise inheritance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of its use in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki in the early 20th century , which has been re@@ produced by nature since then .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to be done with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ juana &apos;s Chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the wra@@ pping of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ó@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has launched its campaign on the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto NEU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan at Nelson Art@@ z .
at the end of August , it will be a highlight of the campaign to give a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? , &quot; ask the M@@ acher of the promotion since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel .
&quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) do not really &quot; write it on its website yesterday .
&quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that much is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are sure that we know as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the action there is more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is considered to form@@ ulate a sing@@ ular promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other mun@@ icipalities .
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f is able to raise their new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ ans fear of the Army
every year early August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es over Pen@@ sion@@ ists and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the session took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the office of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy Secretary and the Minister for Defence , In@@ ner@@ es , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ count .
the government with@@ draws the re@@ ins on the military .
chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office but the Commander of the He@@ eres , the Air Force and the Navy were removed .
since the failed coup , head of Staff Erdogan 169 of the 326 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als has fired .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdogan as a dra@@ h@@ tz@@ her of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people , who should have been involved directly at the attempt of the coup , is negoti@@ ated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the overthrow as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to fully pur@@ ify the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really really handle the army ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ comfort in the Military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there is concern for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islamic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; army that manifest@@ ed among other things in the abol@@ ition of the head@@ scarf ban for sol@@ dat@@ in , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big pu@@ rest in the army and the security forces are continuing .
in mid @-@ July Erdogan ordered further 73@@ 95 State services , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were used earlier than the real lords of the country .
three times they embar@@ ked on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world@@ ly state of state .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan claimed the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdogan is driven by targeted Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine , a name was not so @-@ called officer , who searched for asylum before@@ hand abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extrem@@ ist and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not let Nato cold .
anyway , there is doubts about the read@@ iness of the Turkish army in the alliance of the pur@@ ification of the Turkish army .
the managers and operational skills be &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looks before trying to reduce legal immigrants to 50.000 a year , stric@@ ter rules for vis@@ ing visa for temporary work permit and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by em@@ aking the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will award the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ministry aims to renov@@ ate circuit for rac@@ ers
over the past few months , over the future of the race year was fought - now it should be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , at the sea level , the tourist train is going to be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to secure the long @-@ term project in the long term , according to the data of the transport Department , construction work will start in the course of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the track of Ilmenau @-@ Renn@@ weg , the country is responsible for the tourism important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared traffic Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the repair of the track amounted to about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent .
the contract on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently being coordinated , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen Railway as operators are already agree on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the timetable that used vehicles and quality standards are negoti@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race @-@ shuttle shuttle should thus be ordered on December 2017 .
the race @-@ shuttle shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the train stations Ilmenau and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
in the past few months , the course of a pilot plant has been tested whether the distance of enough many people is used to order them again in the future .
the track is strongly pale in parts .
the Rise of Sex robots is real , and we should worry about
just as you thought it can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible rob@@ ot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin taking their asc@@ ension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and type of fing@@ ern@@ a@@ gel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we &apos;ll see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ no@@ zzles have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon , which feels warm - with consci@@ ously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also adapt its robots according to his beliefs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot through the form of nip@@ ples to type or color of its fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is still worried that many robots have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; own person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would like a st@@ ep@@ ford @-@ woman progres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ no@@ zzles have developed to robots with a silicon .
the real Bot@@ ix @-@ robot allows for instance its users to adapt their robots to the properties , which will be appe@@ aling , such as school@@ ing .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ alities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which medi@@ ates the impression of pup@@ il and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adv@@ entu@@ rous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like you like what you like , and she does not like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
throughout the day , it also has its m@@ oods - like real people !
it can be we@@ ary , fixed on conversation , or she can &quot; be in mood . &quot;
there are many wor@@ rying aspects of this ascent from Sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ c@@ ages on rape , when you take a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : refu@@ elling ) Far@@ rah is in@@ qui@@ eter than most .
on his website uses True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex play .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement indicate a little dar@@ ker and low in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as optional en@@ core .
most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their increasing popularity , they still remain temporary on the edge of the consumer culture .
but what inter@@ fere with the boundary zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time , where we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until the free market has given permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these high @-@ developed sex robots are at a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House , who has said to have sexually attacked women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images that affect the un@@ seen body and the cast @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the goal of these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also using por@@ nost@@ ar propor@@ tions ) .
their builder , they want to feel like human body to im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person@@ alities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robot is not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
you do not have medi@@ ation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
other words : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the phrases of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ umps large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human mind
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a binding of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political trace which the US voters have polarized , even families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Than@@ ksgiving , there were newspapers with advice on how to interact with the hor@@ ror of tr@@ ump .
we all give us all the supp@@ os@@ edly to let our filter bubble burst .
less noticed has been the power of Tr@@ umps , Famili@@ es together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , who visited me this week in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including rep@@ ubli@@ can relationship , with whom they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange at the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it comes to me in another context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the effect of his presidency has the force to move all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ eping opportunity that we will no longer to@@ ast his cookies of one day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is still a long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alizes in the ri@@ ump of the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards , as an in@@ it@@ ome of understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I find myself from an active nost@@ al@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of dec@@ eased - the dog at the Aut@@ od@@ ach that looked at the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to tr@@ ump in fact occur in fact as a very mild off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the New York park department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are scar@@ ce and the animals are turning round about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate music convey@@ s this in notable way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not meet the dream .
five @-@ five years later , and I still didn &apos;t think about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout at the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , a 11 year old man and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could rate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him full score , but fortunately no one had asked about it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store in this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I managed to cross my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same as plus the option to purchase the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also put pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation , in which no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store did exc@@ essi@@ vely gr@@ ins@@ ing while I we@@ ary the experience you made my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with breast pain
for the second time Pist@@ ori@@ us leave the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of inc@@ isions to his hands @-@ joints , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
for murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to death after an appeal by the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by taking it several times by a door of the toil@@ ett@@ enk@@ ins in his home in Pre@@ toria on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a n@@ igh@@ tly int@@ ru@@ der , hidden in the cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , she is too clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Law Authority reported that they may be ob@@ jection to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the ob@@ jection can be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pist@@ ori@@ us runs danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold is a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ cl@@ ut@@ ters from f@@ use and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen were put into school holidays and the continuing schools .
three of the students in the future go to gymn@@ asium , four to the secondary school .
school director Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bi@@ es@@ ental building in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen , on Tuesday evening .
the 29 students , headed by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eag@@ les who grows up in the poultry farm , but then released into liberty .
to this end , the m@@ lower sh@@ ar carried a musical with the title &quot; The eagle in the chicken farm . &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and made it out of its h@@ ens .
instead of a hen ch@@ ick a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken spread out of him , the eag@@ les spread out its wings on a high mountain and ent@@ ail out .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders used to bet .
the Eagle is standing for the integration , said Schul@@ leader Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the young was different from the other young ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to that .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she desired every quad@@ rant , that he feels accepted in his new school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was than@@ ksgiving to the colleagues , the former Schul@@ er Michael Müller , who will always start with instruc@@ tors , and the parent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cooling time is over now , stated class teacher Sophia Schumacher .
they just leave their pupils after two years of lessons , as it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the fourth @-@ wat@@ ery .
finally , all students will sing a song from summer@@ time and holiday season .
with the children , great joy broke out .
eight initial perform@@ ers have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians imprisoned for illeg@@ itim@@ ate Camp@@ ings in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ itim@@ ate people arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have shar@@ pen@@ ed the control of the free camp@@ ground and lay everyone who is found to stay in a place which is not intended for this purpose , causing considerable cash pen@@ alties .
the controls are continued during the whole season .
the Ministry said that the Court can impos@@ e a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
in the diesel @-@ top , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are expected to improve the emission behaviour of emissions of emissions of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or bad are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Car Club Europe are ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the edited software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory upgrades previously apply only to the vehicles to have the Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this retro@@ fitting has been ordered by the Federal Rail@@ road ( KBA ) .
how and when will clients be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but still no exact date called .
Daimler has told you to write any of them .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be done in their frame .
how long will all the changes have been drawn ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; S@@ met@@ anin means .
the connections from the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , the car manufacturer did not act so far on the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will this update last ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming can be , an appointment .
what do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE does not have to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would undergo , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is now a massive price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
but just in the regions where driving age is threat@@ ening .
in rural areas there is no value for older diesel so far .
the ACE advis@@ es to still wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in the Washington .
the first award ceremony among President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first ra@@ pper one of the prestigious awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultivation practice on Thursday announced , there are also singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US president Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and take part in the award with his wife Mel@@ ania .
the Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced that he had already announced the gala to participate in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to completely negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed that they will use tr@@ ump to make their view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital .
Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom H@@ iro and St@@ ing are among the earlier winners .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , works in R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a builder for 31 years .
and the work makes him great fun , as he taught in the press talk .
he tells of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it surprised him that so far no application requires the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next possible time .
so - under respect of regular termination @-@ periods - still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach has been functioning for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ate building authority , the applicants must refer to appropriate degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
if they could not fill this one more , the citizens would have to advise you up to Off@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and himself is important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life value , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the precip@@ itation parking lot are around .
the chin @-@ up between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is also renewed , but also the stadium restoration is still subject matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter only comes to be@@ ech with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are doing it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimated V@@ acker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is present for a city builder of big playing room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ dener can be re@@ acted flexi@@ bly flexi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the gre@@ ens are often referred to by citizens and visitors often . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the old town as ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one eye for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new buildings are approved , the separ@@ ator builder is emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ master we@@ ars high responsibility anyway .
he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything works on my table . &quot;
with the supervision and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep construction ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and remain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the other design of the city .
who wants to buried Roland W@@ acker should have a closed degree in studying architecture as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of construction and building plan .
building Construction Office , Building and Building , Construction Planning , Urban Property and Urban Est@@ abl@@ ishment , and Unter@@ e Building Administration , including Prot@@ ecting Historic Site , including monument protection .
thrown on lines : south@@ ward line blocked
according to police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway station over the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the pipes .
these were so badly damaged that the resulting freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and are looking for the night of night after them .
near the Tat@@ ar , witnesses were watched by witnesses of a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes beyond a branch of Laus@@ itz , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rators could have brought himself into great danger even at risk .
in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant and the late @-@ minute drive and the costs of rail transport could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the South railway line could be run without disabilities .
some ten persons were out Friday afternoon , two of them entered the correspondence .
freight lifts did not fall , however , they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 meters of over@@ lines had to be replaced .
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( infl@@ ammat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digest@@ ive system .
but a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate symptoms of patients with infl@@ ammat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000 , causing stomach cr@@ amps , recur@@ ring , recur@@ ring or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those concerned , meat and dairy products are usually advised to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an of proteins have contributed to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine .
the Chief researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the gut patented to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food , do not enter into the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissue .
when equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a infl@@ ammat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance convey@@ ing immun@@ o@@ deficiency occur in mice which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their in@@ wards .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an - one of the blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bial , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an mice had in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an rich diet toler@@ ate , less anti @-@ infl@@ ammat@@ ory bo@@ wel content , if the same system works with people .
the Post@@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan re@@ alizes that a group of study mo@@ wers had found such cells , but a group of study mo@@ wers had such cells , but it was another group of the same tribe , but it was not separated .
it susp@@ ects that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the mice were sequ@@ enced DNA sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immun@@ o@@ deficiency , but without them in mice .
mice were educated in a ster@@ ile environment so that they lack@@ ed a gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immun@@ o@@ deficiency .
in order to understand how the bacteria felt on the immune system , the researchers dropped L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe imm@@ unity , which were ins@@ ulated by mice .
the immune cells developed to toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of Tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an in the lining of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ us values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant drug @-@ promoting cells like mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal compounds .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans like mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ t@@ oph@@ an were found in people with anti @-@ infl@@ ammat@@ ory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation in the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous values in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; comra@@ des &quot; signed , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der was on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million pounds signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid will start on Tuesday and impressed as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira .
however , M@@ atic was excluded from the Pre@@ par@@ atory Asia @-@ Tour of the blues and only lasted 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve in front of the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him so@@ oner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of und Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started in the avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did launch its start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent In this week , that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted to commit three other new obligations but he insist@@ ed that the club has already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic work &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; three of its four priority new obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painting &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. pilot manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. state of Washington , but drawing in Marqu@@ ette in US state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to the radar shield , the form of a Dream@@ liner was too .
the whole was a lasting test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising previously .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns it : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD chief , the Prime Minister of Ministers looked at some concern for Berlin with a certain concern to Berlin .
only no dis@@ arm@@ ament from the party central , only no head@@ wind from the Bund - this is the most important desire of the campaign .
since Martin Schulz led the party , the fundament@@ ally changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the staff of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ House with growing discover@@ ies observe the events in the SPD @-@ ruled national capit@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with a head@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were low@@ cases .
and one after another .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Parliament sees a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the astonishing frac@@ tion@@ eer of a Green de@@ pu@@ ties broke out the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the country election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the Green Party managing director Michael Kell@@ ner promp@@ ted El@@ ke T@@ ests to leave their mandate .
the Over@@ come to the CDU means a clear for@@ gery of the voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ Mid@@ west must immediately return to their mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal CEO and electoral campaign of the Gre@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Network ( R@@ ND ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not all true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sigh@@ s a SPD election fighter , when on Friday afternoon the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ Message has reached the party center . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Weil , the SPD @-@ President of Lower Saxony , stands after the surrender of the green de@@ pu@@ ties of El@@ ke T@@ ests to the CDU without its own government .
it is the preliminary highlight of all the ranks of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat during the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more not , re@@ ass@@ orted by the comra@@ des .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it was then too - and everything was clearly worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the do@@ ck@@ le , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ an hau@@ te the party smooth .
the comra@@ des re@@ ar@@ ra@@ yed in the weeks later again .
then , when they had created just new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next low@@ ball came .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD chief of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did so pretty wrong in crisis communication , doing what you can do wrong .
since then Sch@@ olz fights for his political survival .
so now Stephan Weil .
due to the VW @-@ exhaust aff@@ aires and his role in the Supervisory Board , the Angl@@ o @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese um@@ fra@@ ctions were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps , because in the past few weeks , because in the past few weeks , because in the past few weeks , because in recent weeks .
the ende@@ av@@ ours of the former mayor of Hanover , to develop his power in Berlin , was not hidden as comra@@ des in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they left him because they promised to be a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could enter .
in doing so , because on the part@@ isan of the part@@ isan , there is no guilt because of the part@@ isan .
and Schulz does not even exist .
at times , comra@@ des therefore ende@@ av@@ our to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and above all , on the isolated par@@ v@@ ests in T@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democracy @-@ related to how woman T@@ ails have their own career information about the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Parliament committee , the German Parliament Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ ails was not elected as a direct candidate , but has been elected to Parliament on the state list of the Sax@@ on Green Party .
the logical consequence would be that they return to their mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliament , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the voters of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony &apos;s candidate to the German elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CDU @-@ MPs now fal@@ si@@ fied the outcome of the election , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or more further additions of the CDU Nieders@@ achsen .
funding funds for the local government III
who would like to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative of Ste@@ g Urban Development will be informed on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave a review of the previously unknown .
since 1991 there is in sens@@ ory rehabilitation areas .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance was at least 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only close new construction areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , you received the information given by the Regier@@ ungsp@@ rä@@ si@@ dium Karlsruhe that there will be a san@@ itation III .
the funding amount will amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros would come from the country , the rest of the church sens@@ ations .
how is a rehabilitation area now ?
you will continue to examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are .
but it also plays a role if in the planned territory rise to interest , to renov@@ ate .
if necessary , the District borders may move again .
the ste@@ g featured on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
cellar presented the contents of the Bund countries program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be performed .
the core of the programme are the re@@ loc@@ alization of inner cities which improve the improvement of living and working conditions and maintaining and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be obtained , which means per plot .
the san@@ itation zone would finally set aside as a proposition .
the elig@@ i@@ bility period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2017 .
until September this year , however , only once again the inventory would be carried out , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a question@@ naire .
in November or December , as possible , the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign will take place , so that next year with the renov@@ ations can be started .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that any Commun@@ e had to perform the forec@@ asted preliminary studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the urban ab@@ normal@@ ities and decide to decide when it is re@@ formed and in what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the property is then also included in the basic book for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come once again to sens@@ ations and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of the parties involved .
therefore question@@ n@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow question@@ naire is the &quot; building and boundary arch , &quot; with which it works among other things in the building condition and san@@ itation prospects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey question@@ naire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; budget and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating arch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill when in the building business premises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a retired question@@ naire is not at the same time an application for convey@@ ing resources .
new construction measures are also not eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of convey@@ ing resources after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ hound principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function - who first comes , ste@@ als first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no funding will be reserved for later . &quot;
finally , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make a restoration &quot; tasty . &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door@@ step , entering his office and can even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ tham , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has been merged with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advis@@ ory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standard .
the technology is similar to a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ tham also wants to change the castles of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising cost of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicopter to fly to South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American manufacturing in the last month , costs tax pay@@ ers to leave the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was at the White House with American construction programs on July 17th .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of all 50 states .
the helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississi@@ ppi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landing at the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , who is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only wanted that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event its predecessor , the Deputy Commander of Aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on 17 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
the note adds that if departure from the White House should be delayed , a second squ@@ ad would require a second squ@@ ad for the return flight .
the original flight agreement was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
the records provided by the TIM@@ E were not clear whether the second flight was finally required .
the Brands Act prohib@@ its federal laws , nation@@ alized property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we found was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed about it that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was described as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by Brands Hatch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to reform of health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and propag@@ ated efforts to integrate government regulations .
the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump performed an investigation as the presidential plane in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Tax@@ i@@ Services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential plane through its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn in order to impos@@ e the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timet@@ ables .
as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led to the White House 58 exercise land@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted at the training needs of the hang@@ ings for the month , said an official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this day Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew an additional 11 hours to &quot; non @-@ Presi@@ dential Supp@@ sions . &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were no load for any of the other pro@@ ps which were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter onto the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to stak@@ eholders from the U.S. Department of Defense for fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight lesson .
recording of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the st@@ aff@@ s is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund sets for Do@@ D not contain the cost of personnel , but also consider the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract .
at that time , the former press conference of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
of course , it is reasonable to emphas@@ ize . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acts with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and spoke to the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task

the TC blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ulated Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
despite five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s balance , the leader in the second tennis league has received the sense of reality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; team manager Mar@@ ius Z@@ ay certainly has respect for the opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just on the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , especially imports from the high North .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; it is difficult for us as always .
you also need a good dose of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip in the high North is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ ju@@ vier .
if the Fren@@ chman tournament is currently being active in the Italian Bi@@ ella , the Fren@@ chman did not enter the Bundesliga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) played at the tournament in Czech Liber@@ ec , is coming to its first use in this season .
the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white r@@ ary An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski , at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was supposed to be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ guil@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories on the last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could again press the team again .

how America Can harm O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he was on Wednesday evening his signature under the law of the pro@@ vocation of sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hatred , the law en@@ forced the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the local O@@ MV have been co @-@ funded by North Stream 2 with other European firms .
the dr@@ one is huge .
however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to aw@@ aken the sanctions by an executive order .
twelve weapons are given to him for the election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed which the group could off , and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role backward : the city represents 46 ch@@ icks
the town organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with firm contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban pa@@ yo@@ ungst@@ ers .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the municipal child care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back in Fe@@ atu@@ ie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , assistant leader in the field of youth welfare , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all really pleased us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is going to go out of the house : a C@@ ater@@ ina takes over this task and delivers freshly ch@@ illed cooled .
the town operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children receive a warm meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ a@@ year 2800 children were seated at the tables , and the need grow steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , not only children who are taken care of the 45 week@@ day , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 14 am . &quot;
46 sub@@ time staff members have served as of September 1st , kitchen service : they heat up the supplied dishes , supplement them for salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .

&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now fixed to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for kit@@ esur@@ fing to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it is also about : healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children are to help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen raft will be useful .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not continuously changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far as the task of the kitchen forces - will be completed in the future of special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has also the charm of the kitchen performance also the charm , which they have found themselves in the price comparison between own self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it is called the press office .

Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative , when all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ att , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are chann@@ elled in the provinces in the provinces . three women are chann@@ eling for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can be only really representative and credi@@ ble , if women are not restricted and included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the Presi@@ dential elections will take place on April 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban issued threats against a election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advis@@ ory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year , the elections for the first time the power to be peaceful from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said that a strong role for women will intensi@@ fy the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan independent electoral Commission reported that 1.2 million women registered from a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union of union would like to extend to production at the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company were silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the work , besides other products plan@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
in recent years , Mc@@ V@@ ities named Pla@@ dis , he invested more than 5 million pounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that staff and union representatives will learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s company G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s asked to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns raised to the moderni@@ zation of production lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ ator Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affects our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the labour forces concentrate greatly on the local community and the large Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social use .
therefore , under the prosp@@ ect of jobs , wage and prosperity , and in the background of the Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of living and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production of production at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ p@@ ite in T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment in employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross two months ago , with some questions openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we fully acknowledge the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . we should change our operations at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned against Ne@@ ym@@ ar three years ago ?
the page of La League likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave in their persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having given an offer of £ 189 million in order to trigger its free@@ wheel cl@@ ots , but have warned of Barcelona three years before the world record .
the sensational approach has heated the transit window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season .
after the termination , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G wages offers wages of more than 500.000 GBP a week .
Barcelona is mad about the way that Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way out to the outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans state has always given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G President in front of this prosp@@ ect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried , because they will touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to draw one of our players at oneself , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club pressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in early this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow it to travel to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report Dep@@ lo@@ ding Pope Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the earth@@ s@@ burg cathedral spar@@ row report on the abuse of mis@@ use by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ normal@@ cy sc@@ andal in the earth@@ s@@ burg cathedral spar@@ rows continues praying for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ ch , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated in the publication of the German press agency and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deepest regret on their own under@@ taking or her then false estim@@ ation of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Vatican Council of Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , critic@@ ised that on violence on violence with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it would have to be prevented and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; degree medi@@ al mani@@ pulation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hab@@ itu@@ al , the Catholic Church , as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday life experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the princess Gloria von Th@@ urn und Taxis meant an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy to go on the church and that &apos;s a folded fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were a completely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical agent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to be ready for children , as I was one to finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are un@@ fair to apply today standards for past few decades , because the world changed .
in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared often .
the author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , author and historian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , commented on the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 1945 and early the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ ums &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 cathedral spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; sum@@ ming up that Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
even with high Emot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also drop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims are estimated to estimate the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are linked to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview , H@@ es@@ emann , explains why the final report for the abuse of abuse at the Regen@@ sberg domain Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence Against the Prot@@ ective Bapt@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; is a contra@@ dic@@ tory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a lift many students stand out his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it appears as a ch@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which has been possible for the eye of the oil if there was musically no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as a biograph@@ er ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one should rather ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
he is dedicated to him eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of all suspicion of center or soci@@ alizing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
violent ex@@ cess@@ es at the pre@@ school took place outside of his sphere .
one can canc@@ els him if it was too late , or first , not taken seriously enough to have taken hold of it seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salv@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; heaven , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was perceived by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salv@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the broad majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincer@@ ely &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who provided the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and candy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional virtu@@ ality , which also led to che@@ ut@@ ches .
that he threw himself not only with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also under@@ p@@ ly distributed boys and ears to the hair or ears , he has already given too many years ago , deeply regret , and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to his honor , however , it has to be said that such gu@@ ardi@@ ans in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents as teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think of each of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state school .
compared to what is actually doing in this report , namely the dis@@ co@@ uns@@ elling sexual abuse and violence on the pre@@ school , they are free Bag@@ at@@ elles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you already wonder if it doesn &apos;t seem to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ance and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just thrown on him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Bavarian Pope , there are many who never understood him , still ze@@ al@@ ously .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media in connection with the report a lot about the mis@@ use of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Regen@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is reported in the media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also any handling or soci@@ alizing in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : clearly no .
not only the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entru@@ sted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never been entru@@ sted to speak with my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a shared representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they trusted not even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ rows student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a frag@@ mented disciple : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he reck@@ oned ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had tim@@ ely findings and could have had the respective perpet@@ rators .
I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected to be more urgent or more clear , or more , than opposite their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conduc@@ tors , confidenti@@ ality etc .
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ th@@ ink@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report comes to the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the pupils concerned in the lead and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger so shared by everyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this way he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought him to an ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , there is no reason to link his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was reading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ sberg domain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will be presented in the report &quot; Weg@@ ner . &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is a mis@@ use of the report .
there is also clean separated : between the pre@@ school and the gymn@@ asium of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we once say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report was treated from the time since 1945 , so out of four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the cathedral spar@@ row .
the whole horri@@ fic test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers were sub@@ stit@@ ched and nar@@ rowed , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to re@@ igns .
but with those Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister had nothing to do with Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boy only on his face when she was already at the school gymn@@ asium .
this was how the most witnesses emphas@@ ize , the theme of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different from the school ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there was a discipline there , but no sa@@ dist@@ ic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims will estimate the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are linked to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus at the most still the repro@@ ach , to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods , in which it was reported by the conditions at the primary school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he did not have worked and responsible ( such a witness ) did not hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently put the ears in front of the conditions ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ymn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he points out this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the test should continue to practice the test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommended urgent need in view of the risk of negative presses .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity were banned in Bavaria as well as in Bavaria .
before that , it happened in a legal grey zone , as each of us knows yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it was difficult to estimate for him , where the affected has been ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised , and where really the permitted limit has been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t say , it would have always looked out .
that just doesn &apos;t right .
only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria .
advoc@@ ate Gloria from Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it should be un@@ fair to apply today &apos;s ped@@ agog@@ ical guidelines on the time of time .
how do you see that ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ea of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the risk to judge the past of today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess has quite right .
but of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ stain@@ ed at all times , and not for what was broken up in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s pra@@ ys , which goes beyond the back of the time .
this is all completely horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be processed .
but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his funds for discipl@@ ines and punishment , i.e. ear p@@ ears and ears to draw , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also kept strictly against it .
which picture of his Regen@@ cy period has played Georg R@@ atz@@ inger than in the convers@@ ations with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope . &quot;
was the subject of exam@@ ining also available for language ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , telling his perspective , as the cathedral spar@@ rows played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t waste that it led a strict regime there .
but also this has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably have been possible to form a institution of Wel@@ tran@@ s , true cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one does not even make a big singer and stand before any success , in which area , yet discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ coming .
what kind of people have you experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through work on the book and beyond that , I have experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , li@@ vel@@ ih@@ ood , deeply belie@@ ving and heart@@ y people , from which one could not imagine that he could do something like a fly .
I &apos;m getting regular , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ itus , regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of them are grateful to him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lo@@ vable respect , to which they still look up and honor them .
and please , once again clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were at the time on the agenda .
we can be glad we have overcome this time far .
but it is highly un@@ fair , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make media sin .
there is the evil purpose , which is behind it , only very obvious .
for the report that was just released was dischar@@ ged him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the att@@ itudes , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany probably would probably know the Regen@@ cy castles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
