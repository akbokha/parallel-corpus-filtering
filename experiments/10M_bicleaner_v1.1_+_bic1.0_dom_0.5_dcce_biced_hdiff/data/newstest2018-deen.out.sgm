<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view to the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish-Anstalt, where youths will meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting card where to dig now for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners undergo the former reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It nervt when land cards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">This knows everyone who had to feel more exciting because the car Navi takes place in a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of State Government, are everything else than currently - but very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and churches in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered canvas, which one sees as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">The great review card were incorporated for towns and municipalities more detailed maps, so called urpositional leaves.</seg>
<seg id="13">This arose according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and skipped the initial survey of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the spring of 1800 the French Heeresleader has occupied Bavaria since the second coalition of coalition with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns on behalf - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "even if the French troops entered the Peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbours that created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project ahead, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is found as all the others on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is substitling which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the map of the map, which was in 1877, being part of the Municipality of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, sub-sendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of submerged are concentrating around 1856 along the Plinganserstraße that was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian farmer's uprising against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "where the western park is, you can see anything as fields - at first glance: a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered copies from the so-called" "" "Urumption" "" "which was derived from the basic income." ""</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots have no more farmers - but small gardeners of the complex "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the Oktoberfests, was actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the territory of the present area Au-Haidhausen it is not only reading the street names" "" "at the tavern" "" "or by the hill" "" "on the ventilation" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfield Road you once locked people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">The Munich district-Irrenanstalt was built there in 1858 / 59. "</seg>
<seg id="34">In 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the décor - the psychiatrist who is brought to King Ludwig II's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was advanced for his time and ended for example the cassettes of the so-called Irren." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged for an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in the hair of 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatric regions.</seg>
<seg id="40">In the area of former Auer Anstalt people will now meet youths in the Munich Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the 1920 building complex and converted it into a youth hostel with vocational training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is located on the football field of the TSV Munich east, east of homes from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "- in architectural reference to the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt was destroyed during the Second World War in bombings." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as "main place," the department store named "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allied forces seized many holes in the city center in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are working and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn train line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">The old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the National Association for the promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to the country due to discriminating politics and the racist attacks of the state after Missouri." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which should come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro American travelers, visitors and Missourians to be careful when travelling by the state, as a number of questionable, racial incidents in the whole country occur and noted here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently approved law of Missouri, which makes people harder to gain a discriminent of discrimination, as well as the prosecutions of the State, the disproportionate on minority interests, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>

<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racial crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in the beginning of the year, after spending no petrol during the journey through the state and arrested by the police of Missouri in custody, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recently published report by the Office of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than whiteness.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware of, and their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>

<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 Hassverts in 2015, after the most recent figures from the FBI, the FBI, who made the state in relation to the number of such injuries on the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to sustain a company because of residence or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the immigration authorities committed to suspend people because of immigration violations which will contribute to other racenprofiling in accordance with ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times we have used stakeholders as response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Soft project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishing bacher Weidezvn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestagsled Peter White and Kordula Kovac had made a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the fishing village of Tildemann met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially allowed insights into his company in which he manages 55 hectares of land and 40 hectares of forest offering 40 cows, and as well as many kittens and accommodates in five apartments.</seg>

<seg id="74">"" "since he is also the BLHV President of fishing, he called" "" "elementary project" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't work on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green landscape has to be processed for a lot of work, much muts with the motor sense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elternal operation and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the decimal projection and is pleased with the Leader promotion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">Farmers should be assisted at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "we hope that the afforestation of the surfaces might be gone out for a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and make some thoughts on how to continue their job," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares, which cannot be forwarded until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was funded by half over leader, a quarter contributed by the village of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers would like to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weidezvn.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and landwives" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="91">The Agricultural Development Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state subsidy of wheat fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the closing of the Schwarzwald.</seg>

<seg id="94">"" "" "" "furthermore, the surface area must not be pperishable (hangincline over 35 percent) and must be threatened with the afforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which is almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently running for the fishing bacher Weidezvale project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The closure surface corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate it as well as any other - hence the fall of Saddam Hussein's position at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologist of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a hitty battle with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the drastic limitation of legal Immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boaters and Liberty-Imitators would have put him ynynchronously when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, has been added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "as Miller Acosta complained:" "" "I don't want to go down here to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem, which you refer to, was added later, and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is knowledgeable right, but how he formulated it himself, it does not really go about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "it is about the contemptful words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the anger of the poor:" "" "your troubles, your poor, and your adressed masses, who are longing to breathe freely, / wishing waste of your rich coasts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the trash waste was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict: in fact, a conflict around the meaning of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who decided to place their words after their death on the basis - did not know that they have accomplished a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "" "" "the sculpture should show the links between French and American republics by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an worn classic image." ""</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">Exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people wanted to change the right wing for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptizer for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is nible, but rather an early neocclusion that bring the American flame to the enveloped world: "lady Liberty goes forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not to shine through the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is quite unusual here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite a question of perception of the perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was in them to see how they were seen from the exhausting, but hopeful people after long and often horrible trips on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and a chance to improve their lives." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome you have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch shall not shine through the way, but hatred that is their sole source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World World Championship 2017: Neil Black is the Scottish members of the UK</seg>

<seg id="134">"" "" "" "I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done." ""</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m distance, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought quite naturally, were great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">"" "the Commonwealth Silver" "" "Commonwealth Silver" "" "is to compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" "" "incredible" "" "that 16 shallots in the British team are." ""</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship were seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance of Muir leads to this path and has launched five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare who runs 1,500 m is another shallot going on after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships, as the only other Scotsman at the Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the" "" "tremendous capitalists say that" "" "it is very proud" "" "to the fact that many of their countrymen did not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the finals." ""</seg>

<seg id="152">"obviously I am very proud of all the shallots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well established athletes, athletes who want to climb on Podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just a great atmosphere there. "</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics on Facebook: do not bevel a public office when you cannot tolerate the polling of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of all, from the Domestic Policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He impacted upon the critique, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in the year 1783, Washington said," "" "The freedom strike can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, as sheep are led to battles" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan expected to work out more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions from at least 450 people who have shown their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union rejected him in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governance of the governors left the lawsuit as frivolol, and the online commentary was full of a counter action with" "" "Na, and?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand on the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillfully to use Facebook as primores to connect with his voters and to use his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Thus, blocking persons, who come to the governors' side - which is a public forum, which is officially called and of employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse announced the actions of the governors and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing further than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolls or spammers or hindly people who vibrate the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"" "" "" "and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls." ""</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor receded the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, MD., was not hindelly filled, but she asked to tempt.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented, that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hassling and other latest news," "" "she wrote in the commentary range" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people on the same subject takes place, then they are considered as a so-called collective commitment and is not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governance of the governors as" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "advocate" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook-era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "it is much cleaner than in early times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or burn demonstrators to silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly this happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official that he criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The president of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, last the first amendment, according to U.S. district judges James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portrait had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous lettering encamped on his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous Trolle.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16th at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a singular little odine."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Baden-Württemberg Urgonbook: Count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain to Tumlingen with the Vogister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the document was based on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, besides the former parish church, which belonged to the church, or the patron saint, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there lived people there.</seg>

<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church, and he could also inherited this owner.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, the right to put a priest or to submit a new pastor to the Bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Larger of the two crush on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later during World War II in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">On the 30-year-old war (1616 to 1648) the window plates were stacked and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was undense.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead of listening.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the steeple had to stand.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm caught the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only today existing tower-zwerg remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history.</seg>

<seg id="497">The program begins at 16.30.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment to a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne had not packed her bags and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I sought something similar to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a closed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add to Joanne's storage room and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she ordered the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Aadi from Notting Hill to make a 12.5-foot high ceilings and create a home not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">The fan had to think creative to solve the award.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were persuaded to each other, without that we had to gaps." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but put the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it to place two rooms in full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper window of Retrouvius looks down across the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors play a role when adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to cause him longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the best and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineering thing went in," explains Erfan of stainless steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is so important that if you move the door up, it is very easy to glide." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base surface - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the bottom size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"" "" "" "here they managed to enlarge the floor area, and simultaneously use high quality materials that provide the room its luxurious advantage." ""</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and they therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you into electric outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design and increased square meter of something that can be transformed into something completely natural.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and have failed.</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"as John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, at his first working day with executive staff, he introduced a major problem in president Donald Trump of White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that come into the hands of the president.</seg>

<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to counter trump by monitoring its media diligence.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump On TV goes back for decades - and now, where he's in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was annoyed by unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were persuaded," "" "said the former electoral consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite POLITICO." ""</seg>

<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps has ever been "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campsites know something that we do not know other - that Trumps tweets have not included more combustible material without interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never experience something about Tweets that has not sent trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff had made it a few times, anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has to prevent it consistently, that trump check out controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people sit together in a white house that prepares itself out of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by supporting trump material, which perhaps promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - dealing with this story - reported in May on the preference of adviser to access the President of strategic reasons.</seg>

<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he was among others as a draftsman for congratulation. - what frustrated him.</seg>

<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, at the end of the 60's breakthrough: with the release of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again, the artists of cities were inspired.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Big, roundish Mordillo figures meet in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits on the drawing day, almost ten hours a day.</seg>

<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has brought down the effects of climate change, which has much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small chicade, a microbacterium that transfers the Zwergzikaden, and with very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>

<seg id="1802">Lavender oil is not only lured for holidays, it is also very asked for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said, "instead of very long plant guns with a large number of flowers we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have less parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">To the solutions that are taken into consideration are a better water distribution and slowing of evaporation in the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry ness.</seg>

<seg id="1809">Killing a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for the reporting of the youngest chaos in the state of Sinaloa, organised crime, corrupt civil and unceasing drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were the goal of an attack with grenades, or let them go home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponent, neutrale, ally.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of government or cartel, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There are no rest periods from violence, and while in all the country the corpses, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, ever since President Enrique Pena Nieto, in December 2012, there have been at least seven dead in seven states in this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their editor and her inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," "" "says Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply experienced, although its presence is present everywhere - a big picture of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," it depends on the facade of the Riodoce. two reporters in the thirties, wearing T-Shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared issues, trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">"" "" "" "although the prosecution was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has led only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of Morden, who are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are only rarely asked.</seg>
<seg id="1824">In Riodoce, they are still struggling to treat the violence of Sinaloa, even though it is uncomforting, even though the terrain is still traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information on the murderer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know why, we don't miss them all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was shot from his car and was shot for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Schütze drove away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there are virtually nothing to be silent.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest in the past year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa was one of the country's bloody battlefields to fight, since rival fractions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, one day or more people are shot on the road or that the cemetery is full of enchanting, two-storey mausoleums for drug makers who are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a carton has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">At first there was publication of a interviews with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival Cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may be annoyed by the sons, who bought gangsters bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were shipped to newspaper kioske.</seg>
<seg id="1842">"" "" "" "the second fault was to force Valdez, after the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security." ""</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues decided that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he merged with five colleagues to the founding of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars in holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the smovenom problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time, the paper served a reputation for courageous and honest coverage, and sales and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters fell, hard to publish hard studies without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else could deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors Cabot Award" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, where he always led them.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.</seg>

<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-professorship and self maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell a sense that can be fooled... and then the cause with Javier is happening."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, such as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routen, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>

<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen found protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, whom the Governor itself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporter has gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug-bound are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has blocked three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It was the assassination of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the public spending, focused on the town's home town.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in Culiacan, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite site of drug retailers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter knew from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-karmic cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous events in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who are protesting against the murders of journalists, because the staff had become something that they had never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped up a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist to the office of the Attorney.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become more loud in all country by writing "SOS Press" in organized protests and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On this day, the director Bojorquez was gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and to destroy them, because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has therefore asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is worried that their rage has violated their objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unaware of the same - that hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupach and haircuts that were sent to you by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst made a 35-year prison sentence after it publicly made diplomatic reports on the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was converted to Barack Obama as he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithm created by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, such as someone could look like this genomic data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, has been convicted of the identification as woman, but was sentenced to 20 counts in 2013, including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">The prison was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in the Manning sits on a driver's seat and a platinum, which she has been associated with.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Therein produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigars and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste, to produce a picture of it, as these people might look like.</seg>

<seg id="2137">And she could not see at that time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were sent out to unequal wishing, which resulted in several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic illustrated by Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Support Images," which would predict a future in which the president would like chelated judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning was calling for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy gathering.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to detach the rigid spans, which he should actually go further.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The Rise of Sex robots is real, and we should worry about</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be even more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the area of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernagel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people are fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we'll see them much more frequently," "" "said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern snozzles have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon, which feels warm - with consciously human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can also adapt its robots according to his beliefs" "" "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot through the form of nipples to type or color of its fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it is still worried that many robots have" "" "own personalities" "", "which would like a stepford-woman progressively." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern snozzles have developed to robots with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix-robot allows for instance its users to adapt their robots to the properties, which will be appealing, such as schooling.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which mediates the impression of pupil and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "" "the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">Like you like what you like, and she does not like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Throughout the day, it also has its moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">It can be weary, fixed on conversation, or she can "be in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many worrying aspects of this ascent from Sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subcages on rape, when you take a step on Frigid (i.e. here: refuelling) Farrah is inquieter than most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website uses True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy?" "" "it is called on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex play.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement indicate a little darker and low in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their increasing popularity, they still remain temporary on the edge of the consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what interfere with the boundary zones, can be in relation to the spirit of time, where we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market has given permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"" "" "" "there is a certain overlapping that these high-developed sex robots are at a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House, who has said to have sexually attacked women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images that affect the unseen body and the cast-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal of these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also using pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builder, they want to feel like human body to imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, to the point, when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robot is not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">You do not have mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Other words: they are counterpart slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrases of 2017: maid service</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of the healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">"" "" "" "it has become a binding of the Trump-era that the political trace which the US voters have polarized, even families in small format." ""</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice on how to interact with the horror of trump.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all give us all the supposedly to let our filter bubble burst.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed has been the power of Trumps, Families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-left poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, who visited me this week in New York.</seg>

<seg id="2433">In order to the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it comes to me in another context that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by trump, but the effect of his presidency has the force to move all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" "" "normalisation" "" "and trump, we refer to the creeping opportunity that we will no longer toast his cookies of one day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is still a long-term long-term scenario," "" "normalizes in the riump of the right wing" "", "which suddenly appeared in comparison to his standards, as an initome of understanding." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's funny version of deceased - the dog at the Autodach that looked at the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to trump in fact occur in fact as a very mild offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the New York park department, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are scarce and the animals are turning round about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climate music conveys this in notable way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the Skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not meet the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Five-five years later, and I still didn't think about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counting - but a big roundabout at the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, since two years old, a 11 year old man and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could rate the carousel, I would have given him full score, but fortunately no one had asked about it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store in this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I managed to cross my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same as plus the option to purchase the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the shop.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also put pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation, in which no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store did excessively grinsing while I weary the experience you made my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million and in Great Britain 300,000, causing stomach cramps, recurring, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those concerned, meat and dairy products are usually advised to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins have contributed to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patented to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food, do not enter into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance conveying immunodeficiency occur in mice which carry a certain bacterium in their inwards.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"" "Professor Colonna said:" "" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance." ""</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan mice had in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan rich diet tolerate, less anti-inflammatory bowel content, if the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan realizes that a group of study mowers had found such cells, but a group of study mowers had such cells, but it was another group of the same tribe, but it was not separated.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It suspects that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The mice were sequenced DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found in mice with the immunodeficiency, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were educated in a sterile environment so that they lacked a gut microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created the L. reuteri and the immunodeficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria felt on the immune system, the researchers dropped L. reuteri in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immunity, which were insulated by mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of Tryptophan-Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the lining of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopus values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant drug-promoting cells like mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal compounds.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans like mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation in the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential can lead high tryptophanous values in presence of L. reuteri to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2891">The final report on the abnormalcy scandal in the earthsburg cathedral sparrows continues praying for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisch, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated in the publication of the German press agency and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deepest regret on their own undertaking or her then false estimation of the processes.</seg>

<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today standards for past few decades, because the world changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger appeared often.</seg>
<seg id="2901">The author and historian Michael Hesemann, author and historian Michael Hesemann, commented on the "My brother of the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the reconnaissance lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547" "" "Domspatzen" "" "between 1945 and early the 1990s" "" "with high plums" "" "victims of overprint, 67 cathedral sparrows sexually abused." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "summing up that Domenellmeister was applied in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Even with high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also drop.</seg>
<seg id="2907">"" "" "" "nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims are estimated to estimate the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are linked to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann, explains why the final report for the abuse of abuse at the Regensberg domain Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence Against the Protective Baptism" "", "is a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For a lift many students stand out his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it appears as a cheriker and perfectionist, which has been possible for the eye of the oil if there was musically no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one should rather ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to him eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of all suspicion of center or socializing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Violent excesses at the preschool took place outside of his sphere.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can cancels him if it was too late, or first, not taken seriously enough to have taken hold of it seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the" "" "Salvation" "", "heaven," "" "heaven, and" "" "better world" "" "was perceived by the" "" "Redemption," "" "and" "" "Salvation" "". "" ""</seg>

"" ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high emotional virtuality, which also led to cheutches.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he threw himself not only with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also underply distributed boys and ears to the hair or ears, he has already given too many years ago, deeply regret, and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "to his honor, however, it has to be said that such guardians in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents as teachers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think of each of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually doing in this report, namely the discounselling sexual abuse and violence on the preschool, they are free Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">"" "" "" "there you already wonder if it doesn't seem to do with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just thrown on him." ""</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, there are many who never understood him, still zealously.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "" "" "in the media in connection with the report a lot about the misuse of the" "" "Regency" "" "is reported in the media." ""</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also any handling or socializing in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not only the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never been entrusted to speak with my father or mother about it," "" "said a shared representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they trusted not even parents and siblings, certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrows student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmented disciple: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he reckoned (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely findings and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected to be more urgent or more clear, or more, than opposite their parents, internatsconductors, confidentiality etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report comes to the clear result:" "" "that the pupils concerned in the lead and / or their surroundings could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">So what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger so shared by everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"" "" "" "this way he cannot be accused of being prevented or brought him to an ad." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to link his good name with these conflicting crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media a lot of" "" "violence" "" "was reading" "" "at the Regensberg domain" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger will be presented in the report "Wegner."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is also clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we once say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report was treated from the time since 1945, so out of four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the cathedral sparrow.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrific test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers were substitched and narrowed, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to reigns.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those Domenellmeister had nothing to do with Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boy only on his face when she was already at the school gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">This was how the most witnesses emphasize, the theme of "preschool" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "it was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a discipline there, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims will estimate the general humanity of R." "" "and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are linked to him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus at the most still the reproach, to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods, in which it was reported by the conditions at the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school where he did not have worked and responsible (such a witness) did not hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently put the ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "he points out this," "" "that the test should continue to practice the test." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">He recommended urgent need in view of the risk of negative presses.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity were banned in Bavaria as well as in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, it happened in a legal grey zone, as each of us knows yet.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"" "" "" "then it was difficult to estimate for him, where the affected has been exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permitted limit has been exceeded." ""</seg>
<seg id="2969">You can't say, it would have always looked out.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That just doesn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Advocate Gloria from Thurn und Taxis claimed that it should be unfair to apply today's pedagogical guidelines on the time of time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the "Fallacea of Anachronism," so the risk to judge the past of today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abstained at all times, and not for what was broken up in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's prays, which goes beyond the back of the time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all completely horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be processed.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His funds for disciplines and punishment, i.e. ear pears and ears to draw, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also kept strictly against it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his Regency period has played Georg Ratzinger than in the conversations with you for the book "My brother of the Pope."</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of examining also available for language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, telling his perspective, as the cathedral sparrows played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't waste that it led a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But also this has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the demand unconditional discipline, it would probably have been possible to form a institution of Weltrans, true cultural ambassador for Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bonbons alone one does not even make a big singer and stand before any success, in which area, yet discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced George Ratzinger in the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through work on the book and beyond that, I have experienced George Ratzinger really well and again as wonderful, humorous, livelihood, deeply believing and hearty people, from which one could not imagine that he could do something like a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I'm getting regular, like many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his Emeritus, regularly contact him to visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of them are grateful to him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all that one accuses to him are educational methods that were at the time on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time far.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unfair, a man, only because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make media sin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil purpose, which is behind it, only very obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that was just released was discharged him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now the attitudes, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany probably would probably know the Regency castles." "" "" ""</seg>
