Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview in@@ comprehen@@ sible now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always be put in drawers or stuck from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to me . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
most of the best way , the actress teaches her time home , pre @-@ TV with lo@@ cker@@ ish D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to white , they bring the question of child desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not be married , or children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child game &quot; is A@@ ni@@ ston as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf club in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger has sought a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 year old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses remembered her celebrations , they pursued after the fast gal@@ lop home to feed .
one kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding arri@@ vals ended then again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer in all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he left his family through the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t swear for a horse .
it was a long time for the first time in Aachen , and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
he does not lack the sympath@@ etic sport@@ sman .
Bundes@@ verfassungs@@ kreuz , Silver nes bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already got him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring for decades .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the double US mast winner was recorded on Saturday into the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the excellent example , the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ us@@ ch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ le Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the jumping competition Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the wrist@@ band of Erhard Wonder@@ ful .
many of these sports men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative company mig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion where the Lav@@ az@@ za price ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a gap to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential election results in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference .
the matter about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts still small in doubt , as the state of economy may harm - with taxes and regul@@ ators .
Clinton wants to pun@@ ish the economy to death and regul@@ ate the economy , he says .
he himself would be completely different , asser@@ t Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will return regul@@ ators heavily , and it will be strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it .
both stak@@ eholders are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the m@@ uts , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying .
the democratic candidate announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure is a classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so , on tr@@ ump , partial internal discussions could be said .
the differences in energy and climate policy are clear .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and res@@ ume the coal transport in the US .
oil extraction should also be possible in far @-@ protected areas , the Paris climate agreement wants to announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment program and demands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only for infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ ish trade agreement , do both not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both the U.S. do not want to isol@@ ate international trade , but just like American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should get paid even better , but calls for Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he might not be changed .
but the great discussion of the next months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
on one side , Tr@@ ump stands , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics keep him , so the budget deficit would only grow bigger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton is asking that at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more taxes are not the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
escape : &quot; any wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost every day .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby , which is at most one year old .
one has put her little son into the arm .
he gu@@ ises with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother soli@@ di@@ eth on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene acts normally .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
she is an area managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social supplies in Bavaria , and deals with the theme women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs started up the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ enk@@ ilfe .
un@@ long it was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who reaches here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically being persecuted because torture or death threat@@ ens or because their families have sent them to Europe as a hope of hope &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many are secretly ste@@ aming because they don &apos;t see any other way away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have experience with sexual violence , forced , hon@@ our@@ ing , hon@@ our@@ ing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
it drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the tu@@ g@@ boat calls for a bottle of water to demand a sexual act is no rarity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believes that the end as soon as they arrived in Germany , are ir@@ re , telling B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugees were often considered inferior and worst .
this leads to about 90 percent of women living in the Munich north , trau@@ mati@@ zed , estimated them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar that they say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to talk openly about the excitement , because the shame is too large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not help themselves , there are more accommodations for them , for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich , some of them respond with no .
there is no such thing in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken .
even in Schw@@ aben alone , some vol@@ uted women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press review of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are floors or private houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Dutch , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study that has been published for the Committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or women and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can be a perpet@@ ual - violence against women &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the shower room should be separately available and accessible for women , stands in the study .
how much the women feel this pat@@ ron@@ age , one can read the dev@@ otion to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assist@@ ants strike : demands according to new labour measures
deputy representatives of the assist@@ ants have called their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) required its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it was a minister to so@@ w the concerns about the contract .
assist@@ ants and medical students enrolled in July on the re@@ jection of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still quietly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which led to the fact that the contract was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new treaty and demands official news of all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board provided a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of calcul@@ ating labour measures that start in early September .
the disputes led to that assist@@ ants strike this year six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , following the election of the agreed agreement made by the BM@@ A , came back .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings held before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medical students that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and supposed to be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and an official end of the last eight months of war and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ parts in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot forbi@@ d that Ankara wants to fight against this reconciliation .
there was the wrist , yes .
but Putin had a nar@@ ro@@ red and radiant little heat , even for its restra@@ ined conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Recep Tayyip Erdogan , however , spoke repeatedly from his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdogan would have beha@@ ved like never had happened .
to me , his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cooling showed that Russia &apos;s head had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to see what he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the period was w@@ asted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin divided and accused Ankara to be in the back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the failure was even bigger , since it has been committed by a promised friend .
the Vet@@ rop@@ es will rebuild itself becomes difficult , even if impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would wear for everything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most serious officials reported that Erd@@ og@@ ans had benefited their own family from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin had received the ap@@ ology from president Erdogan , who wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a tru@@ ce is clear on the hand .
Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends that he can get after the last month of a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his am@@ d .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey took him sh@@ aken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions are hard hit by Turkey - in particular the pro@@ hibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , travel agencies and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resumed .
they count on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
this week , the State TV forec@@ asted vegetables and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i summar@@ ized it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West , as it was a weak response to the attempted power of power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke on it is to draw benefits from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian President in Ankara gained a bonus for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
for Moscow , this is a sense of self @-@ understood that even a deep fear of regim@@ es has changed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the summit meeting in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace in the sea has enabled Russia and Turkey to depic@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of external sides &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : two countries that move from the West and feel po@@ or@@ ly treated and al@@ lied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave himself the role as a peace of peace , but where Russia and Turkey supporting opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be significant , that after almost three hours , both presi@@ dents say on the press conference that they had@@ n &apos;t once touched the subject .
the President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize them .
there is no clear con@@ sensus about it , where a common den@@ om@@ in@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of an open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey ab@@ oss the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders are at least once again talk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Staff of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
the Bank has dis@@ soci@@ ated since then , when she had almost collapsed and had to be saved from eight years ago .
in this period , brand new &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other consumer finance brands .
she supported the international sport with million pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Murray .
but now it has decided to press more national brands in focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , headquarters and stock exchange will be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private clients that get more meaning - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was inter@@ viewed during a tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be at our investment stamp and the brand that our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we are not pursu@@ ing global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own churches for something completely different and our employees will work with customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already told that it will no longer continue to perform Six Nations Sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop at the Bank of brands , as we are asked ourselves inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands , so I think the time has come .

the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat races .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Doug Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy about it happened to New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a national Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the jubil@@ ee when he takes victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two yo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth year of Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that it reaches this milestone that reaches a few before him .
it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusi@@ ast@@ ically for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 prizes if it was not only a weekend and whol@@ es@@ hi@@ jo@@ ckey would be !
Frank@@ ie has suffered almost 30 years of winners , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible yo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of British flat races for two decades .
it was annoying .
a whole series of grand tournaments , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he survived also a plane crash and received a drug ban .
three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning , when he returned from his six month of Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two fl@@ yers and return to his order .
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said before , that he wants to continue with competitions until his least 50@@ .@@ ten years .
Russian Putin &apos;s Chief of Staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin had to off@@ end his staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was part of the close friend of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed Special Repres@@ ent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was Deputy Chairman since 2012 , was appointed as his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 in Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Kre@@ m@@ lin website it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the head of the government and the leader of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state of bills and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
in the Russian TV station on Friday , Putin told that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
are the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff came back to his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - above all , just before the parliamentary elections .
so is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was employed as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism .
in his remarks on Putin that are cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say to trust this very complicated item for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the position in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Council ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin reached power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most .
once Ivan@@ ov was accepted after Putin &apos;s second term president of Russia , there would have been a third term of coup against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close ally , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after he was producer
Gibson was involved last month at a physical confron@@ tation on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement on his re@@ sign@@ ation .
Gibson , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the notice of his termination .
at the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details about how the character Gib@@ sons of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , will be published according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios are expected to be published later .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old who played in the sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Greg , has been with it since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love the Min@@ ds and I put my whole heart in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gibson said in one on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be at the end , but it won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a series only .
the twel@@ f@@ th edition of the twel@@ f@@ th season is scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish , that landed in Ban@@ ff garden
a Ban@@ ff residents called for the identification of fish help , who di@@ pped in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could act with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , who were taken out by a fountain of fountain .
Mr B@@ ain who lives about 500 meters from the sea , Per@@ is@@ cope released a video of the spectac@@ le in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two @-@ inch long fish .
Queens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North @-@ deck of Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deck@@ geb@@ ou@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approaching the bridge of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 s@@ lan@@ ders .
the project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
the building of Economic Affairs Keith Brown equi@@ ps a visit to the building site and was one of the first that went from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ land Cros@@ sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of a engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a fin@@ icky activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fitting .
a total of nearly 79 % of the bridge de@@ cks in their place and the last section of the deck will get a bed base for the deck today , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
with this fantastic project the closure of the tr@@ end@@ setting up @-@ looking high and deep building represents .
after installing the last road section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ mo@@ deck , we had to close the already existing gap on the north or country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern periph@@ ery of 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , about 6,000 tons are weighing and at an inc@@ line of about 3 % had to be drawn up .
delicate , as the toler@@ ances working on which the team were working , tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters .
fortunately everything went very well .
res@@ cu@@ ing in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off their fishing boat off Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station fought on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T , after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the life station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have blown up the boat except their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man were exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bu@@ ever hanging out without rescue .
they all came on board of coastal defence and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men that were thrown into the water were lucky to be un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded during the car@@ ving of the boat from the person who tax@@ ed the boat .
someone knew about these men today .

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the green of the SPD : investors will have to be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hand@@ le concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next council session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but conflict is programmed .
first of all , it is about the question : who should build the favorable apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD @-@ Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are happy with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who want to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments may , however , may also be built on the stocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the big dispute in the city hall was , however , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to build on private faces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent , but 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing program , which will cost millions and is still financed , should provide inc@@ enti@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU want to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants har@@ sh@@ ly har@@ sh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of the way , Brat@@ mann , whi@@ pped the situation on the housing market .
if the concept is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not completely different : for around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does it compare to loss of more than 1300 advant@@ ageous apartments , whose funding will run out in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , according to the planning policy , Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city .
moreover , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding .
this is possible in the western town .
the problem can be solved on one fell s@@ woo@@ p .
because in the West city the end of the year will run from the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could get back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social apartments in the West Bank will dramatically increase dramatically , from the aim of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few city parts .
the Gre@@ ens predi@@ ct that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU must be with the boat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is concentrated on more building sites for detached houses .
but what does not mean , that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which pays off
it is fascinating to look how the world is changing .
that teen@@ ager and child not go outside , but rather , prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , was su@@ ed on screens in the last decade of many .
with Pok@@ em@@ on Go it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
the time on the screen was at the beginning on the TV , then limited to video games and last on smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclu@@ de each other .
I take a look at the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later on a drawing series , cards , and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many phenomena of pop culture , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand sun@@ k in early July .
the market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who are followed with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( about a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , pro@@ secuted 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent , followed by 45 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active on deaf ears , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be assessed .
who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages , which is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful an Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people go hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as always , there is also m@@ ür@@ rical game , which always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it supposed to do ?
it has a breakthrough for itself .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its attraction , and the use will fail .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter , and heal@@ thier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ entur@@ er
forget the pressure .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the floor .
definitely brillan@@ t along the line .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for multi @-@ campaign titles and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly before the Silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five , &quot; Mann@@ a Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze tom@@ et@@ ist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Simone Bal@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish mon@@ ks during the single multi @-@ campaign during the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American player who wins a multi @-@ campaign titles and overall , while she consoli@@ dates their reputation , the best of its generation or even at all .
she broke out in tears , when their final score was shown and their long journey took place at this moment .
this success she puts in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of their sport , 15 world championship medals , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals , that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on said of her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I ever saw . &quot;
it was a final exam in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the remainder of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden over@@ sized expectations .
not with a hand@@ ful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced each other after they have won gold and silver in the solo show of women in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served at the farewell celebration of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a retreat .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on top of their long way@@ mark on the top , never the future is planned , it is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is suited to Latin American music , which would be at home on the street outside the Olympics in Rio .
this is no co@@ incidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip into the gym , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has no more to be lost , a victory which will hold so long as it desires .
even if Must@@ afa was slightly led by two revol@@ ves , the image sm@@ elled .
P@@ atter@@ ing and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
she brought back again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig &apos;s beams - and sat on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g@@ ged her gently than they expected her du@@ vet - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , when the vision described it once in her collection book , to reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ mates , who is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , is a lead .
after their ground exercise , she fell to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ eba , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as it concerns , it has a completely new meaning for the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ mal in the car shot during the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela &apos;s liner , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the offen@@ ders fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is available in the report .
the police shared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ man , since the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 which took possession of one of the adult victims .
the police report by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard told that investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at it , whether they are connected with four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine months and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and the same mur@@ derer were committed .
Ellis , 33 , was hospit@@ alised because of their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which had an empty Pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the mass mur@@ derer .
medi@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 year old girl with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it is better &quot;
like most 6 years , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of his age , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of genetic distur@@ b@@ ance about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought , I don &apos;t create it .
I don &apos;t create it .
I did not let myself down .
what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund they never can recognize them under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Edmund can run with help of a help .
Edmund could neither sit nor cra@@ w@@ ling until his third year and he cannot speak .
but he makes progress slowly .
he can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something out of mind &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but there is no typical character language -- she says . Edmund invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses like meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is the life that is influenced by the c@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I wondered , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t really know .
I have no longer asked about the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by the z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue rescue in Louisiana , Mississi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to pro@@ claim the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday over with more rain .
numerous rivers in the southeast Louis@@ i@@ anas and south of the Mississi@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service .
the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards stated that state officials are standing in contact with local authorities and help the congreg@@ ations already underway .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Governor , shared the en@@ quiries for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa could have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ ding system is used across many parts in the South Louis@@ i@@ anas up to Saturday .
the weather service could be re@@ designed that additional 3 to 5 @-@ inch of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ amas , a Fl@@ ut@@ early system was deployed on Friday , while mobile continued in the field of mobile .
the Com@@ ite river near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , will reach a record level of all lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood for the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Krau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ lap many homes in the subur@@ b of Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a down@@ ward down@@ ward floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river junction fa@@ w , south of the Mississi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still hit people from the flood in the Am@@ ite areas and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y H@@ ans@@ ford , his wife and his st@@ ep@@ son found themselves under those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by the Glo@@ ster on Friday .
H@@ ans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually located more than 400 feet from his house , rise sharp@@ ly overnight .
he said that another man &apos;s son , who lives near , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and pushed the water flowing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ ans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
his wife , H@@ ans@@ ford said that she lived in the 48 years in which she had never seen such a strongh@@ old of the river .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that he and his family members could have all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
H@@ ans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer could have saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls , and that the authorities consider evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Krau@@ t@@ mann , an ob@@ server is close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight until Friday morning of 13,@@ 75 inches of rain .
Krau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been very su@@ cked by the rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floods have caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a sub @-@ ordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa reported 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which are now both flooded .
the officer of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities could have saved 72 people and seven pets , which were washed from floo@@ ding .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ aries were decorated to host the evacu@@ ation .
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to flood and sand@@ bags for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their houses and shops .
&quot; the last major floods , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal authorities .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Mississi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his details a hand@@ ful of houses on Thursday should be reported as over@@ flooded , but on Friday they were not reported until now .

Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; ext@@ ingu@@ ished by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ving shooting in Philadelphia
the police divi@@ des that the 6 year old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents gave that Brown has suffered several gun shots , including in the end , leg , arm , and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was ext@@ ingu@@ ished by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ don@@ z shared the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people shot at the German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 year old , who is in a critical condition , found out , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police just determined if you could find under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators split C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it apparently came to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , who were persecuted in various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , had survived the crime scene .
it seems , that it clearly acted upon a contin@@ ual struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the trail , pul@@ ses were taken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided police force p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also met in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently checks the video surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl hit the arm when she played in front of her house in the area of West O@@ ak Lane .
it re@@ covers and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine among the women &apos;s Olympic team in the tur@@ nes and that of more than one reason .
first , I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant .
and secon@@ dly , this team has three tur@@ ists , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ in and Madison Ko@@ cian , the cath@@ o@@ lic@@ in is round , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it fixed the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last four years number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ gies a A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year , Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising winning winner and America .
now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were a@@ waited , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ emen .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won in an individual meeting event for women &apos;s gold .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the tip of this sport , but we do not see trainers in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie beat all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four tur@@ ists in the team . besides , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and Turner will be held primarily in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained for training , setup , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in weal@@ thy suburbs , who can support the business .
in these clubs the Turner will receive its entire training and that is for the families a dev@@ out and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , train@@ ee of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have started their athl@@ ete since they started with the gymn@@ ast@@ ics .
we have to be inspired by the mun@@ icipalities Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a capacity and easier to access .
I founded my gy@@ ms of 20 years .
with my events we have offered free and affordable tur@@ f in Harlem for over 15,000 young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer youth @-@ quality tur@@ nes that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport .
tur@@ nes develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness to the mind .
this combination provides life @-@ long advantages for health and training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ ast@@ ics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real portra@@ yal of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls with different background motiv@@ ates to begin their way to get healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance teams would like to organize further strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal is rejected
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting a reform agreement with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants who desc@@ ended on a vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t Plans had revealed that the Treaty inevitably lead to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said that the N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the staff and patients were harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assist@@ ants to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly projects , to improve the care of uns@@ elling times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Commission for assist@@ ants published last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assist@@ ants have grown to the proposed contract as serious concerns , in particular that it will heat the current staff crisis and treat it to meet all doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only eight weeks to remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new treaty , progress must be made and time runs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
efforts provided by the BM@@ A to participate in discussions caused by talks during the government on the ad@@ versary and sometimes on o@@ hren@@ num@@ bing silence .
this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done over the last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t needs to act now , lift up the up@@ stream and discuss the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
if he do not do this , the assist@@ ants have made clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routines and 100,000 appoint@@ ments , as nur@@ ses and specialist doctors were involved in order to grant doctors on the strike chain cover .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting the reform of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to pay a better week@@ day pay for the 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS , called for assist@@ ants to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour measures are nothing of the only little , but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families just worry , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the Com@@ intern of Assist@@ ants and respon@@ ds to the Ministry of Health and other Minist@@ ries positively on concerns about the gu@@ ardi@@ an@@ ship and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as post@@ ing , flexibility in training , training holidays and gender @-@ specific pay@@ roll in medicine - a sign for this , how serious it were the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attacks
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug , after it was recommended by the authorities to submit this more people for a longer period of time .
the ag@@ it@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack which reduces the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
Regulation N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four years of taking to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
Regulation N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has recommended a four years of taking to reduce the risk of cardi@@ ovascular problems .
each year some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer from a heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by collecting fet@@ al material in the arter@@ ies , the cover@@ ings form .

when the blood cl@@ ots loos@@ ens , it can flow through the flow of blood and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .

T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and is distributed under the name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reducing this risk by making it more unlikely to formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the design of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health institute , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffered a heart attack or a stroke - often with dis@@ astro@@ us consequences . &quot;
fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in to reduce further heart attacks and strokes in people who had already had a heart attack .
due to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand the treatment options of thousands of people who can benefit .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . management design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness can flour@@ ish election fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on request of a governmental report because of corruption from office
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness led to that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congreg@@ ations will be ignored as a devast@@ ating government report today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet committee Sir Eric Pic@@ kles will attack the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and local government , which is now a anti @-@ corrupt , said that the inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives should be so bad that the police should be permitted to al@@ ign off har@@ nesses outside of electoral cabins to help protect voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommends that voters should take a reference to the election in order to prove their identity .
at present , a voters need to call its name and address .
the report proposes that not removing removing ink on the finger of a person if they vote their vote to prevent anyone cho@@ oses twice .
wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower should be more protection , Sir Eric says .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non official comp@@ lies or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud but it should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that her@@ ding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets Wahl@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special random court decided that the am@@ ic@@ ating mayor Lut@@ for Rah@@ man after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his life should be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he had brought his critics to silence with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis of choosing the reli@@ ance of Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or as a result of a night@@ fall , when someone else cho@@ oses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed themselves in particular al@@ ar@@ ming for the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ election - at the older members of the Muslim community could have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the elec@@ torate , including the guide of ID to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as proof was raised , that pressure on the needy members of some ethnic min@@ orities has been exerc@@ ised , in particular women and young people to choose in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ ish background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns ... state institutions such as such behaviour were ignored because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is drawn by Ther@@ esa May , requires tou@@ g@@ her registration checks to prevent the election directory is used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to consider elec@@ torate before choosing to your ID .
do not use removed ink on the finger of a person once they released their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice .
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to make sure they are entitled to in@@ discri@@ min@@ ate .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic post@@ code .
pro@@ hibition , that political activists edit full letter choices and envelop@@ es of stamp elections .
the police give the authority to set up ab@@ ut@@ ations around election stations .
a bill of legislation which facil@@ itates an indictment for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
photographer banned in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the constitu@@ ency ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the personnel generally prevail that voters go alone to the c@@ ab cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has called Lut@@ for Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high demands of criminal proceedings - was found guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controlled &quot; of the election regist@@ ers of the Rath@@ geber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Court of Justice in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries as the mother of par@@ li@@ aments a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Dou@@ bling and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic Port in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be out this week on the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band that has proven to be an impressive double acc@@ ent of the Du@@ chess in Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is far from this summer by far not the only to have gold batt@@ ling Ath@@ let , who has its own famous doubles - at least not when one can give the social media belief .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which is currently running on our screens , F@@ email has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that exhibit more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ wood@@ lands .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood .
apart from K@@ ates double acc@@ ent on the wheel track , many people referred to the Internet as a certain arch@@ ery of the Di@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created an ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after images on which he looks like the Wolf of Wall Street Star incomplete , emerging .
in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness in the social media and gave to that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the visual hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is a hand@@ some guy , so I hate it as compli@@ ments . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly enter the centre : the re@@ semb@@ lance of re@@ semb@@ lance between the British expan@@ se Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
the Russian gymn@@ ast of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes should go through a double @-@ acc@@ ent for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gloria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the Gle@@ e Star Matthew Morrison for years .
one step higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another great comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , which has similar eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver med@@ alists Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova has more than just the sun@@ tan lot@@ us and blond hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian from fans was att@@ est@@ ed to the &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not only the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy that other simil@@ ar@@ ities are also fallen .
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hope und Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually the US football star Hope Solo and the Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons by Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical with the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , broad sm@@ iles that is similar to the Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union .

the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Donalds thought that his microphone is off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ sh@@ ov@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought to the comm@@ ent@@ ators team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colour &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one could hear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
too excited , like M@@ ief , he died like a pig .

viewers in all Canada responded quickly after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and speech .
Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane Twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ m@@ in from China &quot; like a pig die &quot; ? ? ? ?
the idi@@ ot has not captured that they were still on show . &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m distance swimming pool for women as described : &quot; these small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard in which many were given to him .
Twitter users did not look back when they heard how in@@ sensitive Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter User@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
the presence of the C@@ BC and Canada will show us all like shaving . # attached .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short while later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a floating @-@ performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an un@@ happy chosen wording , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times at the end of the people who responded to the comments on Twitter
the commentary volume Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald .
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore it right that these statements were made and that it was possible that they will be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ zed yesterday night with our viewers on the show and our followers in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to tell one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and un@@ happy chosen form@@ ulation . Byron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for me to excuse me for the comment that I made after women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olympic programme , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I took part in the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
of course , no failure was intended , and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mor@@ row sen@@ ches about woman , who tried sh@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to see when a woman went out her clothing among a pri@@ mar@@ row to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered like she looked out , she pulled out and put them back to the shelf .
she continued and tast@@ ed four pairs of sau@@ h@@ osen in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put it back to the shelf
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son , who was at the same time in store , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ garments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she went back again and left the shop without buying something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area she also took a pair of sau@@ c@@ ots from the situation , pulled her own stran@@ ghts and pants and tast@@ ed them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she re@@ treated the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it again , because she put them back to the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t like anything , back again and r@@ ushed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt her - or think about the person who would buy the under@@ pants which she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How to think anyone would take shelter with his home , which had a different person and not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I received , the staff have tried to drag the clothes out of the sale , after she went - what exactly is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple , and find out that another woman knew her and went out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone , deliber@@ ately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to move to armed c@@ ens@@ ors near the distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching your front or behind , this video will show you how you turn the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you turn back from behind , then you should turn right out so you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon from your front arm and shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
beat him then with the knees into the cr@@ ust and rotate , while the att@@ ack@@ ers are collap@@ sible before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run and move backwards while they judge the weapon on him .
when att@@ ack@@ ers approaching , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , take the weapon and rotate it , so the att@@ acker cannot shoot .
while you move the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on your chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and judge the weapon on him .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how to do Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est on the saf@@ est to pass your money - unless you are no Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and stim@@ ulated a serious test - by taking some of the dirty and most poll@@ uted places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel writer Ian Wright , 51 , from Suff@@ olk will leave his course on a euro bill , a hand@@ held at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush with a train shower and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system .
before leaving every object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to settle .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to lick the pur@@ ge of a draw@@ toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke about doctors and medical professionals to promote intestinal bacteria and their own health .
fortunately , nothing left behind him , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. Wright was known to test the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate pec@@ uli@@ ar as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to the r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets , the task set his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a kid I was relatively un@@ worried about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was appointed to his reputation .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ mo showed a lumin@@ ometer count of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ ometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse , after its L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was above 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes to the worst thing I smoked in a toilet , close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here , because it is here inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer something new .
something that is fascinating to watch , and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we told &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information about an interesting way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film direction , added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have put my respect for Ian , that I have instructed him for some of the things I have instructed him , such as the ec@@ lec@@ ting Russian toilet which will be shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where this was pretty difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one of the survey conducted by validation of 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents , 84 per cent of all respon@@ dents were associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , and 58 percent said they at least use products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an o@@ cial family left their social residence after a delay of £ 50,000 because they terror@@ ized their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they have been for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , people found the property of the housing estate in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls are cl@@ oned holes , wooden sl@@ ats were rolled up , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ffiti was lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she lives in a private accommodation now .
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration in Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they &apos;re afraid that the apartment could no longer be rep@@ airing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is probably considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror , who had joined the family , inti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug abuse , and excessive scre@@ ams .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease agreement in June , an arrangement for ant@@ is@@ other@@ mal behavior .
in some rooms of the house , which is torn down under circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
they were traded in the property , in which drugs were traded , the wooden handles were consumed .
neighbors , they said they were fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ ed her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ ously from the property , after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunte@@ ered .
the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbors , who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family would face the local authorities to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years long .
on the over@@ grown side of the parish house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that it will feed the ten@@ ant to assume any responsibility for their behaviour and to their family , as a del@@ og@@ ation is always the last step , who consider the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours must be horri@@ ble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall and members of the community , who have approached us and have provided us the information we have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate con@@ sol@@ ation to some neighbours and medi@@ ates the message that ant@@ is@@ other@@ mal behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they all were over 20 .
a dirty mattress laid back in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ og@@ ing on the ground .
workers of the in @-@ house administration will now have to fo@@ rest@@ rain the hostel that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ans , par@@ ap@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine , after it was found guilty of the possession of a drug B drug in a merchant account .
they claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 with a car accident .
after they were without ob@@ d@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth .
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ffiti with gra@@ ffiti .
the police says that they will del@@ ve les@@ see who do not keep in the house rules
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row test@@ ified by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall with that the del@@ og@@ ation is a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not stick to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who have been aware of without deduc@@ tions , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ is@@ ite behaviour that continue to collabor@@ ate with partners to protect our churches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal moved to panic after flying an eff@@ ig@@ lie@@ utenant military beach
Sonnen@@ an@@ ey@@ er in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life
a portu@@ guese flight P @-@ 3C Orion Air@@ plane of the Air Force made an incredible crash flight
the Air Force gave that it was on a training flight , but persist@@ ed that no security risk was prec@@ eded
this was the moment in which fri@@ ghtening tourists begin to panic after an eff@@ ig@@ lie@@ utenant jet about a full beach crashing .
dramatic video recordings showed , as the military plane flew close to sun@@ beds on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the holidays pointed out when they were understand@@ ably started to make concerns about the noise of the nozzle , without having to see what was coming from the clouds on it .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists posted on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ uno Arro@@ ja added : &quot; I was just at surfing , and it felt like that the aircraft would fall down upon me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were moved to panic when the plane came from the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
today , the Portuguese Air Force gave the fact that the pilot of the P @-@ 3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and so deep flying that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet has flown somewhat deeper than usual in the vicinity of the poor sight@@ se@@ fires , however , the Air Force insist@@ ed on ensuring that the security at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed those summer parts of the Portuguese mainland where four people came to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force today issued that the pilot had to fly because of the circumstances - strong fog and surf - so deep flying , which restri@@ cts his view
the aircraft was on a training flight , where pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ tremendous problems ″ in election campaigns
the leadership of the US Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , also in traditionally conservative states their majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave up weakness of his campaign in the previous rep@@ ubli@@ can strongh@@ old Utah . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rare moment , in which the usually co@@ cky and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns expressed as correspondence .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within its own rep@@ ubli@@ can camp , the doubts will grow in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
blame are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resumed his well @-@ known media h@@ unters again .
rep@@ ubli@@ can high bur@@ gers w@@ ack@@ ers
Utah is usually a secure bank for rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor were laid out by the Democ@@ rat , Hillary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question how he would stop the advance of Clin@@ tons again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you are leaving , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not make anything other than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness in the end , it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party of Tr@@ ump is threatened to cut funds to support his electoral campaign , he should not present better sel@@ ects values .
instead , one wants to strengthen the candidates of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans stronger among the arms .
Olympia : rotating Sc@@ am in D@@ oping Test
the IO@@ C will set up a disciplinary commission on the case .
Kenya for athletes threat@@ ens the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Un@@ reported after the second D@@ oping Aff@@ air .
after an attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home .
the International Olympic Committee agreed to set up a disciplinary commission in order to examine the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary was told that the former Spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village called a Ur@@ in sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ äu@@ ble F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this has been reported by the Team@@ Executive C@@ annon of the D@@ oping controls .
the IA@@ AF world association has the IO@@ C for information about the case to impos@@ e their own exam@@ inations , divided a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was in a IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to D@@ oping control station and issued himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Ken@@ yan boss de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stand on the list for training checks of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich has become more than 800 metres in the Beijing World Championship in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Management Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
it should be informed about cash payments of his country on upcoming d@@ oping tests .
according to media reports , he report@@ edly been arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
in the IO@@ C , Kenya has been under special observation for a long period of time under the IO@@ C .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 d@@ oping target controlled from the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Olympics , it was unusual that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are being taken into the visor .
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya took from the list of countries whose d@@ oping rules are consistent with the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports the ARD was repeatedly collected , that in Kenya D@@ oping is easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar study in Kenya as he had employed it in Russian athle@@ tics .
it could be proven that this sport is nation@@ wide and systematically ins@@ ulated .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ Year the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one master@@ piece .
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the classic temple and filled with the role of Mary a youth night@@ mare .
in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he is black@@ ened .
we always say that she is very Latin .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she re@@ members her lover with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dance .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musically extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I &apos;m Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so it is smart , of course nai@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character I think as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for working with her .
it is an enormous human being .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is at all very important !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we had the refugees , then the Pu@@ re@@ lics back to New York , and the New York inhabitants didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same issues , and they are just as meaningful as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .

K@@ adi@@ za SU@@ LT@@ ANA , one of three British school girls left in London to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ n@@ ime Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family experienced a couple of weeks from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .

SU@@ LT@@ ANA was 17 years old and died after their family to leave the war @-@ exploited country and returned to England .
&quot; you can only hope that the only good thing is - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war area - people will ever stop this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e .
in February 2015 SU@@ LT@@ ANA and two other school girls from the East London joined Turkey and subsequently entered a bus to the Syrian border .
sult@@ anas family was told that she married an ISIS soldier in Syria - and became a widow in less months .

Tre@@ ats wants to be neck calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere together to launch a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous people they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us in the beginning of this year that his nude magazin at Old@@ school @-@ PLA@@ Y@@ BO@@ YS distingu@@ ishes , because &quot; Play@@ boy for Men be . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classical n@@ ud@@ ity , where women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the Kal@@ end@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will participate in this project , because it &apos;s a beautiful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; those who doesn &apos;t suit and Erdogan is engaged , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
in short , Kurdish community Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of prot@@ ectors that flee from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
due to the tough action of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan , the Kurdish community awaits Germany , a mass cur@@ ses to Germany .
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , medium term with a few hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime continues fighting the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government passed by Kurdish high levels of pen@@ alties before months , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey are on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the twi@@ sted coup are still sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onable eth@@ n@@ ical Turks .
many will begin to re@@ boot in Europe if they are supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees , in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the group ra@@ vis@@ es Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ an cities .
thereby , Erdogan wants to increase the exp@@ editions to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CDU member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government said that the Federal Government is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in Germany a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdogan critics are held .
for the first time I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , mainly Kurds and opposition groups .
the fire mark@@ er as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t suit and Erdogan is engaged , sitting in the suit@@ cases of suit@@ cases , also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as reported by the newspaper under appeal on figures of the German Ministry of Interior , the Turks occupied the largest group of asylum seek@@ ers in Germany before the coup .
on June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all have been recognized ( 3@@ 9.@@ 625 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , they are not found out of war , poverty or fac@@ in@@ som@@ nia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers after the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by the state of state , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the holidays from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia shall not select the country tag .
they have understood in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
in 2021 , the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the central parliament decided already at the beginning of the year .
as far as so far it does not work : summer holidays , heat and land bal@@ dness - that bit@@ es you .
the locals , who are to be convinced of the soldiers , are on vacation .
most of the tourists who are in the country are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so we must not choose the country &apos;s day .
for this purpose , practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , distribut@@ ing posters , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers and end up the end of voices , only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to leave for election campaign close to the people .
the hot phase , when one can tell that at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Erwin Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must be feared by his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear in surveys behind the CDU .
exciting is how strong new@@ comer AF@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and has been government of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous election campaign , looking from its large posters .
he travels through the land , spread ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , just as it did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise , sailors got cold feet and gives ch@@ anc@@ ellor Merkel the bl@@ aming of the AF@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ rec@@ u@@ ist lists , which will probably cost him a beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CDU with its top @-@ edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make a wrong time at the right place election campaign .
she has invited two ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel to major au@@ sp@@ ies ; Merkel &apos;s parliament is in the north east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berliner and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in NDR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CDU remain largely on the usual electoral conditions on market places and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so , Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role only &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that you leave the base on the land that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the left of the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , are hardly any present in the territory of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Council of the CDU @-@ Elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ reli@@ eved : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering has called up his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU ( 25 ) , only slightly ahead of AF@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD was still clearly won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) .
the green , small part@@ isan with seven percent in the surveys , can be able to jump into the farm .
they make a modern virtu@@ e of holidays in a modern virtu@@ e and impos@@ e their campaign on the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green Elec@@ tor on Sp@@ ur@@ c@@ ens@@ orship go to local vocal towers under the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top edge in , cur@@ v@@ ed with a house boat by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even nice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from locking
at the speed with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain about .
for the responsible works of the construction , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end until 20 o &apos;clock , there are all praise .
&quot; they made everything pretty rocky , &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff tells us from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be re@@ located at the weekend of the half @-@ time schedule , until the end of October everything will be completed .
the opposite will also be the subject responsible for the construction works , e.g. when it comes to the establishment of container cru@@ ises .
since the construction site has immig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the dist@@ ortion of the Asp@@ erg@@ y@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been abolished and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is relaxed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens are now able to drive back from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic through the place seems to be with@@ drawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Deputy Director of the Vice President Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
residents of Bach @-@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Road and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many loops were looking for and more than the signs .
what led to that man@@ cher trucks left in residential areas .
since even the speed limit@@ ers were not adher@@ ed , the assembly needed to ampli@@ fy the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was substantial over@@ passes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself a location on the location . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been blind@@ ed two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the way with 77 kilometres per hour in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has gone on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment has led to their sales fr@@ eres , everyone , whom you ask , can look through .
but some more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that for other firms , the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even at the car deal@@ ership Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most slight drop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also dre@@ aming of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most frequ@@ ented are the local roads along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds distinct words .
this is already existing .
not only him , but all the restaurants have taken it hard . &quot;
it is missing the customers of H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be happy about every euro sales .
he expects sales to expand to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street occupation has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must have dismissed half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently .
instead , ruling Jörg Schmidt , on a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there might be a financial balance , the hospitality would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages provided by the rehabilitation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where something more generous was handled .
in all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass .
after all , family operation has been established here in 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history of history .
now , other regular guests are now going to do less often due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is somewhere else beautiful .
that his regular cli@@ ent@@ ele came back after the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its own history in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
continually is scre@@ wed in the name of the terrorist fighting in laws .
following the latest announ@@ c@@ ements , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now tables a thick security package .
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partners say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable by the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also anno@@ yed myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as interior minister , however , it is located on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achieved con@@ sensus within the coalition &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , there is a little time to run out before he presents his conclusions for the security of the republic .
but they now fall all the more extensive .
a lot has already been announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck of encrypted communications is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU requirements for passenger information and weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities , as well as not surprising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the Mai@@ zi@@ ère de Mai@@ zi@@ ère did not start to make a second stop for proposals to date with the SPD : he wants to set up sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and dou@@ gh@@ ten jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CDU @-@ man cle@@ ars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he still keep doing this for reasonable and demanding , not what the coalition partner does not have a chance anyway .
a few new ideas presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they partly have in itself : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the arrest of people before the deportation .
refugees who are targeted specifically in the country should check out their smart phones and open social media accounts for a security check .
at Dul@@ ventions for exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put even worse than until now - such as crimes or their papers deliber@@ ately throw away their identity .
some of them is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ spo@@ res and leaves questions open .
and with some points - for the un@@ equal treatment of toler@@ ated for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror .
but it cannot be spoken in speech that the bombing of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , many people were concerned about the high refugee numbers concerned about security .
and things that work deeply deeply did not let themselves out in election events .
inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the safegu@@ arding is large .
and yes , there are constitu@@ tions .
the Union and SPD are therefore increasingly important in their position on inner security .
in the past few days , there was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ dener conflict about the equipment of the Federal Police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , also demanded a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban and a return from the double citizenship .
Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here for con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he does not hold anything from a transfer from a double pass .
we have satisfactory the discussion in Germany .
you will be careful not to make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban he has constitutional objec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether his own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partners , it must still show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot inside , which could help dispute .
however , the SPD is currently trying to pro@@ filing safety in the topic of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; note : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is sign@@ alized first and carefully said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen will still be able to assist .
despite diesel and@@ als the distribution numbers rise worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
during the call of the call , the vort@@ ex is about a term .
Volkswagen launches the deliveries in the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s largest passenger car can continue in the previous year despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets .
but in July , the nuclear brand VW weak@@ ened mainly in Western Europe and thus loaded the total sales , such as the company captured in D@@ ax .
throughout the world , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month of July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year .
in the home market Germany , deliveries to almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s brand management led the weaker figures from July , especially on two selling days less in Europe .
in addition , in some core markets , there have been a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey I also deb@@ ited the British vote for the exit from the EU , explained a speaker .
in the USA where the exhaust aff@@ aires initially escal@@ ated , there is also a minus of be@@ ech .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the most affected house brand of Lower Saxony continues to be able to help by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.9 per cent rose to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group Chief Apostle Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales spl@@ its from January to July .
in this period , 1.3 percent more vehicles provided more than 5,@@ 904 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software gas tests .
in Germany alone , VW calls some 2.5 million cars to upgrade to the workshops .
in the wake of the upgrade , VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
according to the re@@ arm@@ ament of the vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the customer is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate according to the upgrade , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in business trips . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is legal tender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports that Volkswagen now has a guarantee for full @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by VW @-@ Repres@@ ent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport , the meeting was confirmed that this meeting was made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully met the editions of my investig@@ ative commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or engine power after the upgrade , no deteri@@ or@@ ations will be carried out and all type relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate journeys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen can see the opportunity for example a half year after the upgrade , with a motor damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the customer &apos;s interests it is important to avoid that there is no harm to any other damage that comes at all with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ k@@ andal in case of lack of potential guarantees , as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW now use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the manager Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers that will park 40 million euros on the Gi@@ ro@@ - or agenda items . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Association of German banks speaks of an individual fall and does not see any signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not be afraid to pay for their spar@@ row penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
store bank money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you need to pay 0.4 per cent of pen@@ alties .
this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients to deposits over 100,000 euros on loan or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; € 400 will cost € 400 in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he turned 40 million euros for a time that could be with@@ drawn from one day to the other , and that he could not toler@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs will now continue according to the caus@@ al principle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is simply too dangerous in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four fail@@ ures , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ ker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most clients have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy is significant at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they alone can bear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operational permanently is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks therefore increased their fees for bank transfer , credit cards or transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ ing@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ ate bank branch in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect private clients to pay for deposits , this is the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cli@@ ent@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is abundant from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has established branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
in the region well known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eurs live .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate a def@@ endant for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German People &apos;s Association of German People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold of going to neg@@ atives is very high , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the hike of investors to the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers in Germany do not like this in the width .

before you face the comment section , in order to over@@ lay it under the p@@ seudonym of non @-@ alle@@ g@@ inity of men with rough ins@@ ults , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much spoken re@@ sign@@ ation of sound tiles is not attri@@ but@@ able to a mill@@ enni@@ als boom that lead the curiosity of physical objects , but attri@@ but@@ able to Mid@@ life nost@@ al@@ gia .

but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I keep in the middle of a busy road in S@@ oh@@ o , a modest grey suit , and I will stop my hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
although the heart of So@@ hos is slowly adding to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic record specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to place the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Data number : eight men middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound boards , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed at home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to purchase plates that he could not afford to buy and buy items which he sold as he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , who was released when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agre@@ es to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my master .
NE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets You@@ go@@ v &apos;s profile .
he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy their old records again .
of the convers@@ ations which I have led , people usually have emp@@ tied themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
that would explain the boom of followers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a store such as Phon@@ ica to recognize that record shops offers a cal@@ ming community of equ@@ ities .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of familiar sound platforms , of objects , the happ@@ iest che@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers .
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or poss@@ essing the possession of materi@@ ality as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
that is with me as collectors and I think it is so in many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff of a flat stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player who never use them while 7 % of those who buy a record , no turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried while passing through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Data number : three men of middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone recently came here and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio record , so I can put it to the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product heavy , less music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no turn@@ tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which are very slowly clean .
F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sil@@ ver@@ plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I clean .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women of middle ages .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ y@@ pack@@ ers pop instead of experimental jazz - is it good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks strange , but brand psychological trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to find when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ qu@@ cer than a large purchase .
it doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting panels is not a real option , it says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a loving si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban outfit .
while I admit that je@@ ans hot@@ ter I observe , I observe a group of young teen@@ ager who are group@@ ing for a moment around Polar@@ oid cameras , before a father and his daughter are considering to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks at her - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far as it is impossible to gras@@ p them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for those items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one who gives out most of luxury objects like plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ go@@ v agree , they can at least exist in S@@ oh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality , turn@@ tables , and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en .
these people probably work hard in school or in offices .
they spend their Thurs@@ days tomorrow with security not by disk operations of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the eye of an un@@ fur@@ ious , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false moder@@ ator who rises nothing of the middle aged men above the shoulders .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees .
in case of a court case , the authorities in Cal@@ ais claimed that the state should be authorised to sell 72 mak@@ eup stores within the warehouse , from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dresser services or to sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid , and the risk of fire and vulner@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian groups divided the court to be important that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also led out that the temporary shops and restaurants are often accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the instruction of people who run the 72 temporary shops , but spati@@ ally be that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are absolutely comprehen@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the food shops , cafes , and restaurants would play a much bigger role than people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely pre@@ ventive conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places which was threatened by the Netherlands , was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des Camp , which will be non @-@ profit and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum items for hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 170@@ .000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .

despite Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains batt@@ ling

Be@@ am went to start with his offer only in January and has more than 100,000 users .
you can look at others while playing , but even with yourself .
for example , they can give up to players missions and provide enemies as well as equipment items .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
Germany &apos;s breed must be adjusted to the next generation of speed@@ om@@ eters : in various Länder , among other things in Hessen und Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested that Tem@@ pos@@ ing is especially effective .
the futur@@ istic en@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
for example , on highway building sites or to san@@ itation bridges , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bl@@ ater for the observ@@ ance of speed limit .
a durable mobile structure can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery lasts for five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be collected across several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as transit to time , ride strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the highly frequ@@ ented state you can move the p@@ endants according to manufacturers with every car with trailer hook .
so that it is not easy to use , it is lowered in measuring mode so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and by the way also disappear shr@@ inks .
moreover , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the blo@@ ws from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and now also used .
foreign authorities also flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , following an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji was fet@@ ched gold class gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 im De@@ od@@ oro Stadium in Rio .
Fiji shared a master class in the handling , side Step@@ ping , Sur@@ render , Line of Line and raw , to win gold - their first Olympic gold medal .
the defeat was swe@@ pt away by the non @-@ bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back in the final .
but regardless of this , Fiji would have been defeated in this form a 15 @-@ man team .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is boss Ben Ryan , the former boss of England for Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost every game of Ryan with the Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this loop will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and caused the attack of GB@@ s from fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at that time one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 out as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner which he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly got the ball .
a striking mass of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann from Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it has only stopped Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and still gave it over a minute of play ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u was pre@@ judi@@ ced by other weak tactics of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion carried out a 29 @-@ 0 to the pause .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still lear@@ nt .
it is like that too .
GB introduced basic changes to half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua did go through to Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Norton began an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South @-@ sul@@ ate , whose fans sang , flags swings and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not hard to admire Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s play@@ able approach .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff rang out , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB kicked off cr@@ ushing in the lawn .
previously on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK urged South Africa to a scar@@ c@@ tly match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the bu@@ cks in the first half , but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the post in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ sixth team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory
there will be no engine in gold than those games , and that will mean something like that .
from the first ru@@ d@@ der to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
although there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was at present when she ru@@ ined her second Olympic champion without tax wife in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , which submitted such a standard .
her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter was useless , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ es that gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ abs , which is not reflected the way of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ phe .
behind every gold in the ruin a batt@@ ali@@ on is dependent on the hel@@ pers that make the difference , and there was no more than@@ king than the trainer , who had not been able to survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had my bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio were lucky that he could begin the treatment in early 2014 , out of season , what was the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better again soon .
it was an inc@@ en@@ tive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station around 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
so it begins .
rowing is already a challenge , but this makes it a bigger one .
in the in@@ gen@@ esis of the victory their first thought of Williams , who had a ner@@ ven@@ ous morning , spent a bit more than to speak , and trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was the cent@@ ur@@ ion in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this might be something extremely rare but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I could not have wished for a better person or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race over the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with whom their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Helen called &quot; lead in the process , lead in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something different .
we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race which we did .
the pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am a Olympics .
it was all that new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
that feels so much better , &quot; she said .
for 31 years , exemplary for clarity .
the managing director of the water purpose group , &quot; V@@ eit@@ one Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , goes into retirement .
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavaria &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small F@@ rän@@ k@@ ischer drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original original in a contribution of Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ ks were awarded the purpose of the purpose .
the work of the v@@ eit@@ ful group sailed &quot; Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the twin @-@ association staff , 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 15@@ 0,000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants .
member churches are the churches of the Church , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other cities and communities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Mayor , Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was nominated as a water service in 1985 and was appointed CEO of the purpose of the purpose in 1988 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they were working on office building and maintenance work on office and organis@@ ational activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency par@@ agra@@ phs on weekends , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and compensation of farmers in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the new fountain ( 1999 ) , re@@ development of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the renov@@ ations of water pipes .
there have been no breast@@ feeding and has always been added to improvements , because water life were de@@ fied and drinking water is the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ atio they praised G@@ öl@@ ler faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water purpose and he has been living the water purpose association as it would be his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few weeks ago , as a real pract@@ iti@@ oner , he may present the successful concept of the v@@ eit@@ ful group of nit@@ rates in front of the Water Forum of Unter@@ fran@@ ken .
for this he received much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s one hand praised waters of Alf@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water gun and he was a loyal fan .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from its point of view , he identified the fountain construction and restructuring of the purpose .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult commitment was the pipeline at the Hoch@@ sal near Kirch@@ lou@@ der on January 3rd .
at minus 17 degrees the whole night was to work , so that the towns could be supplied with water .
once again , the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n has only been maintained only because you filled the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots in danger of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ rator is on the escape , after him I am publicly de@@ pressed .
in the meantime , Sven S. could be travelling with the car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 m tall , muscular , brown burnt and has a glass .
in the meantime , the police published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man bears a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could also wear the weapon in themselves , so the police .
if Sven S. sees , the 110 will call .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was year 1988 , the perpet@@ rator in 1981 .
the police in Lübeck did not want to make any data to the T@@ ather@@ land or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ mit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently do not say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police minister in Lübeck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special operational command ( SEK ) was at the crime scene .

&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains on the release of the renewable energy industry in the German steel industry , the Federal Minister of Finance , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeinen Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m really glad that we were able to finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask for steel producers to demand gases from high @-@ oven for electricity generation , to cas@@ hier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the German industry sector , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic cleaning with the EU Commission after discussions with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG conversion ratio of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the EU Commission for its own production .
the status quo of the previous regulation will largely be established .
special importance have the successful artwork by Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , the future is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on the reform of the emission law , climate and employment goals are considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall leader Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suff@@ ers under over@@ capacity and a significant price pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the situation will continue to grow as the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weak@@ ened domestic demand massive steel to the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
European manufacturers dis@@ card Chinese steel companies prize d@@ ump@@ ing .
during this spring , the situation has something relaxed .
for one point , import duties on imp@@ air@@ ment effect , to the others have lifted the economic prospects in China .
un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp stayed carefully on Thursday .
the prices were again stag@@ nat@@ ing .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reduction .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to conclude the following works of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July German steel producers remain carefully in spite of increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons , six percent less crude steel than in the previous month , as the economic unification was divided on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced now returns to the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association will have an increasing emissions in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing sen@@ iors good
the singing has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp for their whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher college , she reserved the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old singing in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physical , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , they feel balanced , cheerful and a lively , she says .
by the way they are doing something good in their health and mind .
for singing is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Erhard H@@ ik@@ er says of the German senior senior League .
most sen@@ iors sing in chorus and sharing with like @-@ minded people of music , he describes H@@ ik@@ er .
being regular together , Sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
because often social and familiar structures in the age of age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask and organise themselves on the others to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , says H@@ ik@@ er means .
for the sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled respir@@ ation .
anyone who calls his lung regularly is not so fast in everyday life .
even if it comes to obtain the sound of voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher position , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time .
L@@ enz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs by older people w@@ akes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
by lyrics and particularly melodies , Dem@@ enti@@ ous people with@@ drew from a long with@@ drawn events .
in singing the head is also required a special performance , L@@ enz explains .
at the same time focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just older people who live alone so don &apos;t just practise on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , H@@ ik@@ er means .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self este@@ em grows through singing in the choir .
to show itself : if I am long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience is strengthening .
good reasons to start singing with singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , do not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent is advis@@ able .
you do not sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people who can hear when a sound is next to it ?
in search of suitable offer , Sen@@ iors have several options , says H@@ ik@@ er .
someone sings from the acquain@@ t@@ ance circle in an veter@@ an ench@@ y@@ or , you can easily connect .
many towns also offer views of cho@@ irs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn right to the church or church leaders .
you can find many senior cho@@ irs on the Internet too .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research .
who would like to sing , should be sure to join a choir , says H@@ ik@@ er .
singing the soul well and has something liberation - this applies to every age .
cats react sensitive as hang@@ over on scra@@ pping of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , the effect of the calls of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on adult animals .
to her surprise the Mi@@ w also didn &apos;t let the males get cold - but in contrast to the females it was always the same .
female cats may recognize the ar@@ ous@@ al degree of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys on the Mi@@ th@@ es of the Small On@@ es .
they react to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ ittens , who have found in great distress , as scientists have found out of the veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
tom@@ cat may also respond to the calls of k@@ ittens - but always equal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mist@@ rust of less and strong er@@ ased vir@@ s for the males either are either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not meaning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ ittens @-@ sh@@ re@@ ie distingu@@ ishes with the ur@@ gency of their help needs .
a total of nine adult males and eight males were observed in the animal restra@@ int of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a herd of small ones , which were taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger K@@ ittens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results despite the lower sample for meaningful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who still had no own offspring , re@@ acted on Sch@@ re@@ ie , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they swi@@ ft@@ ly turned into loud@@ speakers if this rod of the most inherited kit@@ ten played .
this ability may possibly be born or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said Bi@@ olog@@ in .
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise .
there were also some studies that women responded sensitive to babies , whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
the first attempt in Turkey takes place once again an important football match in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Erz@@ riv@@ alen between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul in Kon@@ ya the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already in July , the government &apos;s suspension system in July was not affected by the government , everyday life of regular vou@@ chers should not be affected .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
even before the football is not made .
the pro@@ secutor issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
according to this , South America living in America is now being accused of being a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver should be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan .
although the suspension is valid for 90 days until October , but in fact , on the life of the most Turks , this is as good as no effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country has ended Erdogan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ ans .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Turks were in view of dramatic experiences in history , the strict re@@ jection of military coup is .
even the fans themselves agree - whether you strike your heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or c@@ ic@@ tas .
with Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Cologne in the last season under proof : at 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first season as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his club .
in the final match against Fen@@ er@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
the paper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him , &quot; He was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master took a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the first round , in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came out early in the European League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the south of Li@@ g it was only sixth rank sixth .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed this and that is the most important thing , &quot; says Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master R@@ ik@@ tas the game year went better .
especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who scored 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ gu@@ eur on the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
at the end of the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had only declared a loan after the attempt to return for the political situation in the country after his EM vacation .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; cited the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club@@ head F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this would be willing to be willing to refra@@ in from roughly one third of its EUR 7.5 million annual sal@@ aries that is clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite d@@ oping : these athletes still have medals @-@ chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice because of dop@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
other super@@ es@@ ful athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic d@@ oping is determined by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mer@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ eph@@ im@@ owa , which had been su@@ ed after a d@@ oping @-@ lock on the grid shortly before the games , was excav@@ ated and spread out at their start ( 100 meters breast ) .
there was a sk@@ ur@@ ry scene : with a set smile she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance with her appearance .
as a festive thing she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ ile storm .
but there are many more athletes who go to the start in the Rio Olympics , despite d@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in the athle@@ tics .
he was closed for d@@ oping two times ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion even runs faster than before , it &apos;s about 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest ch@@ allen@@ ger of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion in 2010 had to sit in a six month period after taking the pain of the pain in Oxy@@ co@@ don .
after surgery , she defended strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world champion in 2013 and European Championship was tested positively by meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the final intake and was closed six months .
the four wid@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold@@ f@@ it@@ in .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positively and 21 months in 2010 .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , approached Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m , so far the fastest man in the world .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( ham@@ mer@@ ed design , Belarus ) : probably barely any athl@@ ete , so many medals have been ab@@ dic@@ ated .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after him was diagnosed with him testosterone d@@ oping .
meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid Dop@@ l@@ ings and the EM @-@ Tit@@ le in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he also recognized the bronze medal from the 2008 Olympic Games in 2008 .
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record artist and Gold@@ f@@ it@@ in has only been tested positively in May , but may still start in Rio .
the 29 year old world championships were found on the in@@ gest@@ ion of a banned dietary supplement , the lock in the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran on July 13 .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ul@@ ll , Friday early .
she had suffered mu@@ gs , and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left this .
she planned her journey home for early September .
whether further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also are also an Austrian citizen , is still un@@ clear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in contact with local authorities in this regard .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in , on Thursday evening , first bom@@ bed two bombs .
according to police , a Thai change were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday again two jumps went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also has been registered in the morning a bomb explosion .
in the Det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured following a police officer .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ east coast of the country , a further bomb explo@@ ded .
according to the authorities in a flower bed , the explo@@ sives in front of the re@@ four of the coastal police had gone into the air .
finally , there are several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the Southeast Coast several injured .
you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too early to express themselves to potential motives - but it is likely to handle the actions of Muslim rebels .
in Thai media , also Thai media wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising , or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , one rather assume that the bombs were laid by enemies of the military jun@@ ta .
in the past few days , authorities have received secret references to the coming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed of the exact time and places .
still be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks .
the police showed their officials in the whole country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ us@@ ement districts .
there are always smaller bomb attacks in Thailand , but they mostly do not act against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his homepage , to make the instructions of Thai Security Council necessarily .
high security risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a and Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
the disputes between security forces and Muslim populations will not be advised before necessary trips to these provinces .
increased level of security ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were performed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution from the military jun@@ ta .
this cle@@ ans the military influence the military influence in the years ahead .
Jun@@ ta @-@ boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ cha said that bombs have been an attempt to cra@@ ck chaos , while the country moving towards stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ e@@ av@@ al , keeps himself the good to have led the kingdom again to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military has not succeeded in obtaining a grip for years in the extreme south of the country of the country of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago in Bangkok were killed in a attack on a popular Hindu shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised to the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several coun@@ sel@@ ing offices , the Constitutional Court also provided the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Constitutional Director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ ated in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ident@@ itarian Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of own identity through alien@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitu@@ ents in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Nieders@@ achsen , Saxony and Thur@@ ing@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said that his authority has agreed closely with the offices .
&quot; groups such as &apos; identity movement &apos; attempt to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Director .
generally speaking extrem@@ ists , they speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the open Islam@@ ists as well as right trem@@ ors .
this is not an advertising advertising for your own thing .
propaganda should address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are due in a special way .
this is dangerous .
lastly , there were reports about contacts of &quot; identity &quot; to AF@@ D politicians from several federal states .
Ma@@ ate said that he had no findings .
possible contacts of this kind would be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AF@@ D - by certain people , which are extrem@@ ist , its target device changes and so extrem@@ ist .
consequently , whether such persons are tax @-@ controlled impact on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
with a view of the significant increase of ri@@ ght@@ ful crimes and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context .
but we &apos;ve found in recent years that there can be legal ror@@ ist structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite true that further legal ror@@ ist groups or small groups , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , plan against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ sex@@ ist motives .
but a nation@@ wide or European control of legal ror@@ ism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
he was worried about that many survivors go into account of people who had@@ n &apos;t appeared in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ect of attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ender or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , who had previously voted with right @-@ sex@@ ist , which might have voted politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left , but have radic@@ alized radic@@ ally by the right @-@ wing mist@@ y mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the head@@ lines or world records at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s summer play .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it wasn &apos;t seen more in the TV images .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was chosen .
Hab@@ te was subsequently committed to viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it in social networks .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a return of 48 seconds and took the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ led by the International swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ presented countries .
since the athletes run most sport@@ s@@ men , Hab@@ sburg wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the big race .
the first nickname had quickly made .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; welfare state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
during the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ant swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters Fre@@ estyle alone .
f@@ rene@@ tically was fired M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ör@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ör@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ör@@ n ( District of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injury , the police shared .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to sof@@ ten their data according to an opposite le@@ av@@ ement , which drove partly on the driving train .
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped in a dit@@ ch like a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; because of the location of the bus , the persons couldn &apos;t leave the bus independent , &quot; she said .
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ last trav@@ eler were brought back to the Pe@@ ws@@ um Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audible district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a spare part of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter of waste are from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wast@@ e@@ water plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ ding of 3,@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 4@@ Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the waste management fee will once again increase if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a superf@@ lu@@ ous calculation , the waste price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget was determined by the country council with Kul@@ mb@@ ach to run out for these se@@ wage plants .
based on the legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated to power the plants with its legal basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial enterprises in the world of trade , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg have to take deeper into the w@@ allet .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the body , a new calculation of the fees for the wast@@ e@@ water community was necessary .
during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 Ex@@ - and lower covers from the previous cal@@ cul@@ ation period would be the same .
with all three se@@ wage plants , Schmidt established that there are relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wage waste , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the small distribution basis , an example of expend@@ itu@@ res for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have to affect .
in addition , the waste water is slightly dec@@ lining in all three systems .
furthermore , over the past three plants have not last fallen in a substantial amount due to their age of san@@ itation and repair expenses .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for the cat@@ th@@ igh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that Az@@ endorf had to be replaced with mechanical ventilation system due to damage to damage .
in the pump stake , the almost 20 year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and used for almost 20 years of operation of the first ten@@ derness , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge had to be installed and an additional ventilation option must be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenditure came into account the continued support and maintenance costs which are to be considered in the new cal@@ cul@@ ation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the previous level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stein@@ häuser made clear that at low se@@ wage waste in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fully crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , Schmidt continued to have spar@@ ed the market church of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned systems will continue to remain pre@@ h@@ ed according to the view of stone houses in the period , since the supply of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be extended because it is a deficit facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian cartoon critic@@ ises
Snap@@ chat tells that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool it enables Snap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that is already adjacent to the sur@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be inspired by Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings .
the filters are unmistak@@ able , self @-@ extrac@@ ting tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all faul@@ ts arrive to the public .
snap@@ chat filters have been drawn up in the past in which they were accused of propag@@ ating the Black@@ face för@@ dere or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when it proposed a filter to some users who gave them battles , false teeth and ev@@ apor@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ low@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeated contro@@ vers@@ y pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indig@@ nation were spread far on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was considered to pay homage to anim@@ e characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ans .
but outside , the rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us experienced , the filter re@@ minded of the frac@@ tures .
others refused the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose twe@@ et were widely distributed over the photos that the filter &quot; hurt and sal@@ v@@ et@@ ly was un@@ comfortable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ statement of a very contra@@ dic@@ tory Asian cartoon and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not secured , but that the yel@@ low@@ ly layer was drawn into the extreme extre@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural st@@ ack@@ et .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ ation and integration of action , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ aries than their older counter@@ players - could rather expect to expect sensi@@ bility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was before , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to collabor@@ ate as a product manager and engineer for medium to er@@ ase their Snap@@ chat account , and others decided to do the same .
in a essay on medium and in a phone interview , she said they believe that ra@@ cial contro@@ vers@@ aries reflect a lack of diversity in the setup practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the great part white , only male leadership and ended their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chin@@ ich @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat most un@@ answered .
the company has no figures for diversity of its workforce and points to its status as private companies .
on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel responsible which focuses on sub@@ ordin@@ ating population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said that she will close her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military Command Pro@@ mis@@ sive ISIS Secret service information , specifies Committee of Con@@ gres@@ ses
military service members of the United States Central Command were able to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ist state in Iraq and Syria as it allowed the actual states locally , reported a investig@@ ative Committee of the Congress in a Report on Thursday .
the Pre@@ liminary Report , created by a Task Force of the rep@@ ubli@@ can members of military intelligence , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Intelligence , reported how to change their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news service information provided by the high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ de@@ es were regularly taken into a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than it had allowed the actual states locally and were consistent than analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited a newspaper article about the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer , when bad analyses will be presented by our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ken Cal@@ vert , rep@@ ubli@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership lies in Cent@@ Com up to the top top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although it does not provide direct indications that government tips will have given instructions to change reports , such as anal@@ ysts exposed to the pressure of their legal laws , an optimal picture of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press releases , comments and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , an Cent@@ Com had publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , rep@@ ubli@@ can Congress of Kansas , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 until the middle of the year 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following reports to play through ISIS in Iraq .
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force after being played to them that anal@@ ysts were concerned about the mani@@ pulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will be continued .
additional investigations by Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Assembly of the Defense Ministry of Defense .
democratic members of the news service committee published their own findings on Thursday , with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created a fully limited process for the creation of military service ass@@ ess@@ ments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the highest ranking of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed publication of retro@@ fitting reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mor@@ ality among anal@@ ysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats said no clu@@ es on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; White House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intervention in Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tors that were taken after complaints by Cent@@ Com Anal@@ ysts .
Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press report of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress of Defense during the investigations of the General Assembly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also announced that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data and that the Secretary of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have imp@@ acted the question of a successful air campaign among American leaders in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have rejected the question , of which President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the obe@@ dient information about the Islam@@ ist state of more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , as a scrip@@ ting in Iraq , looked like a small occup@@ ying forces in Iraq and had a little time on the face of making thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government proposals , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , because these provisional refin@@ eries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
however , this recognition was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ized by members of the legisl@@ ature because of its excessive positive assessment of the state of war on a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA gains quad@@ tes match in the field of women , a show@@ down with Britain before
a day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates of the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually show a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they couldn &apos;t remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , they know , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place to remain un@@ defeated in Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory .
Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two of the two teams will get the first and second place within their group .
the first plat@@ inum will take a little bit longer from the path that lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising host through its success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 courses .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ bat in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became a national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of this team .
they missed the Olympics in 2008 , as it could not qualify for the cad@@ ence .
then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a British , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the working order in London , which we have now .
we have to pull the ruin completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India was without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the play from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game in her hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ pin the ball in the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide to the Americans .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the goal of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
am@@ id@@ st the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and spreading .
it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch is self a burning staff , which is protected from the Cross@@ bow to Turner for tri@@ athletes .
you cannot listen to the TV , read a newspaper or listen when talking about your neighbours in the queu@@ e in the coff@@ es@@ hop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ covering y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of women with dimples , could quite have been sent by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner , or even F@@ real .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting in the Olympic tramp@@ olines for gold .
the Olympic flame is not lit up every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports which are not widely recognized : air guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo .
we will always have the chest swimming and let it rule for a long time .
but if I would like to make arguments for my specific dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping around since 2000 has been an Olympic event , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years has been so exac@@ erb@@ ated that many that I asked , did not know that it &apos;s a Olympic Port .
that could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA was sent to the competition , it has never won a medal in a trampoline and until 2012 has had a athl@@ ete , who made it until the end of 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who shared the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping is a certain outdoor space , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ cleared ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the music for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a bound enthusiasm .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the cart@@ o@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending infl@@ ating - but also the Gra@@ zie of gy@@ ms and diving , the two sports which combines it essentially .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as the spring@@ board . &quot;
the winner jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , h@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before landing at the feet .
you will be evaluated according to the official Olympic programme , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and down , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground .
they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also in the TV broadcast another highlight : the world or the Olympics .
the targeted stre@@ ak is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atical , and it is enough to even stir up an audience with tears .
but it is also what I think about this games as a bit tired .
the trampoline offers an attic .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .

&quot; a generation protest@@ ed &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
protest@@ ers , the political changes in Ethiopia demand violent opposition to the government .
witnesses say that a protest during clas@@ hes were killed during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just joined together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid state of West with a rapidly growing economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ak@@ ened the country and spread themselves in increasingly more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer to the government was merciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot to un@@ armed protest@@ ers and killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moving videos on protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security professionals suggest young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now requires a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to stop this country and in future it will be even harder , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , an Research Group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror and fight against the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded in considerable pace .
its infrastructure improved dramatically - there is a new swing train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations are constantly led by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dis@@ si@@ dents effectively brought into silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or pushed into the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and they don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth are protest@@ ed .
a generation protest@@ ed .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to dig@@ ging in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a considerable critical election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time the tension asc@@ ends along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a fight for these tender , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
anal@@ ysts believe that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which could be forced more or less in recent years , could use tur@@ mo@@ il and could be armed .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter feelings after years of inc@@ an@@ kles should now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate through social media , since cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services .
even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially during protests , many people still can communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide , where they can stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave to that they gathered themselves so much protests .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since Ä@@ onen prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ä@@ th@@ op@@ ia mostly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they are exploited for O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat regions .
but that &apos;s just changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests were held in the regions of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have seen the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for around 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in commerce and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners .
anal@@ ysts say that he was particularly am@@ used to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to work opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively dense reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the region of the Tig@@ ray region , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
anal@@ ysts say that he enjoys the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an uph@@ e@@ av@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections protest@@ ed , according to analysis apparently by the government , exp@@ elled and stolen by the government .
during the following Raz@@ ors many protest@@ ers were killed , even if there were fewer than in the last months , and that time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infra@@ structures , such as the new pend@@ ul@@ um train , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty .
obviously , this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ ery of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ dy city , run by Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media .
anal@@ ysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently told that she concluded this base .
while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he doesn &apos;t want his ally collap@@ sing in a vol@@ at@@ ile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; walk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declar@@ es his asser@@ tion Obama was ISIS was &quot; Sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ vers@@ y on Friday that his campaign re@@ proved that his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clari@@ fied new questions concerning the communication skills of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to be clear and understand@@ able to communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his fel@@ lows that make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position to explain statements that he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he had made the announ@@ cing event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the asser@@ tion on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to interpret the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said that he is simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , at which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a number of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to re@@ we@@ aken something by destroying him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS would not want to know the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate .
the last storm on Mr. Tr@@ ump fell down upon Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to direct his campaign on the economic situation because of falling revers@@ ing .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton had speech@@ es to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this topic again .
on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their words boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism when he said that the Russians should be Mrs. Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but he said later , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic limits in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken from his fans as they arrive , and then possibly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asser@@ t &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction drops off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who is watching the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I think too , he is smart enough to keep his words vag@@ ue so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ use the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more pot@@ ent sound , as its frac@@ tion@@ ate values declined .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , who was published on Friday , showed a guided tour in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump tries to dis@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he frequently accused his critics to dis@@ cer@@ ate his testimony , or mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but as he rein@@ forces attention in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps joke his loyal fellow @-@ stretching back into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant may be his testimony .
Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent princip@@ alities , gave themselves great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ umps , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that Obama was an almost unknown , small organisation before Obama , called it back@@ grounds , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most mainst@@ ream Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to argue that the government had served in Mrs. Clinton as an Foreign Minister who allowed ISIS to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively to control the situation in the Middle East .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and threw them on each of his words and to be pre@@ occupied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats jumped over Mr. Tr@@ umps when only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the Presi@@ dential office .
once upon the price of the market , café comes back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but had a good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were displac@@ ed by the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front .
the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie store , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
native people saw it as last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can still not believe that C@@ B@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when New York &apos;s change is , it is also re@@ gro@@ unding .
a lively bust@@ ling Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a very simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafés .
he began to work in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new out@@ set , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu they are sand@@ wi@@ ches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural t@@ iss@@ ants .
the café serves no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ alled power of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed by William@@ sburg prices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in William@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly .
even after Green@@ point had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coffee break , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was at the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b , which pleased me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee , even if they put a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably made the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not realize that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie used to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold water of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he will soon leave her new neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the site also has further advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill in cold @-@ cooked coffee and sell to bottles .
there is a chance that the café has expanded to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed at the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the loc@@ ale of the local and the ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his asc@@ ension to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took off his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as an enemy , President Roosevelt had a pen@@ chant for refined crimes of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mar@@ yland water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on this day was a little modest : stuffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man said .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to American as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ it &apos;s last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick is told in their book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about living in a residential building at the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest cooperation , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a rep@@ orter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ving snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in the shop since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable mixture ate .
when the rep@@ orter had been min@@ ating , this couple found the couple for a discussion on the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man .
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine so many pean@@ uts to eat , that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; he said .
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women co@@ ves for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ es for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were the Americans to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints the trails that surrounds the country to be no longer the lar@@ v@@ icious country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating was a central , an@@ gled topic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as ten@@ se was the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ll : mysterious dishes such as Bre@@ ad and K@@ asser@@ ollen were re@@ treated to basic food , the cas@@ ser@@ ole as &quot; wonderful kind , food @-@ resi@@ due , &quot; noted Z@@ iegel@@ s , as coo@@ ks could hide from an appe@@ ti@@ zing sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
meat , for years , was the center of American cuisine , became an rarely served luxury .
pec@@ uli@@ ar mix@@ tures were tested because a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutr@@ itious satisfaction was prec@@ eded by taste or even healthy food .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick dish made a dish from this ep@@ och , fried onions with pean@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it wasn &apos;t a popular supplement at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e .
bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit together .
it was typical of many of the utility recipes .
as never before or ever , bud@@ get@@ ary economic crisis - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country ab@@ rup@@ tly .
by published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ol@@ iti@@ oner &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical del@@ icacy .
in particular , reports on the response of government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ mir @-@ Cake @-@ eating @-@ attitude .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen in his kitchen , he served as the million@@ th heavy man of the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked Continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in a almost g@@ ild@@ ed dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was marvellous to real@@ ities .
President Roosevelt would have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ute an example of his stomach .
as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours caused by Ms. Roosevelt to produce the White House the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food . &quot;
many of the species from the era of great depression to deal with food was rejected once the country got back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to food .
the couple had better understood the eating habits of brick @-@ law in law - for example how they could not throw away foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ ck@@ man re@@ minded : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the failure of the wind .
after the plates were evacu@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums that President Roosevelt had lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ alt@@ man and added that it was a common trick , modest recipes to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly di@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly di@@ lu@@ ct@@ antly a spo@@ ons in the tough , brown G@@ lib@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
CO@@ E repeated three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ant he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs assault : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar in his life in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died with a bom@@ bed attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civilian protection group , which has previously saved the life of 6@@ 0,000 people according to the newspaper paper .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life to the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of civil protective that shows him out of an 11 hour rescue of a home from the w@@ reck@@ age of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans on the shining symbol in the hor@@ ror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as heroes , he has never seen himself , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar himself fell victim to a victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have rejected four versions of the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respir@@ atory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the toxic remains of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ ra@@ e is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks usually come to the surface in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Shi@@ ff S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get only with 150 years of offspring .
the Grön@@ agricultural shar@@ ks along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour , it reaches 1,@@ 220 metres far in an hour .
only when it comes to it , the five metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full length 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this top speed .
this lifestyle of lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a sponsor concept for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from a Grön@@ land@@ hai , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ mon@@ lein at the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the evolution bi@@ ologist assumed long that Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie is st@@ ony .
only missing the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface mostly in the winter .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .

possibly they ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ eres and seek Cad@@ aver , which from higher water layers down@@ ward .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch of the North Atlantic ocean .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 inches long , during the greatest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens of the shar@@ ks .
this centre of the lens is already developed before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which are not renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a bit of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens .
their birth should therefore , therefore , after the early 1960s , when Atom w@@ aff@@ s try to hold larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in contrast to 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters of length , the lens , however , contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 .
all the bigger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in its lens , that is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ watch for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland @-@ clock has been an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k should be even 3@@ 92 years old .
the Grön@@ land@@ hai @-@ females then had offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie has become evident at least one and a half centuries .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme mainly live in icy waters , is no co@@ incidence .
the previous record holder , a 211 year old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old har@@ po@@ on pointed , was caught up on Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on the fl@@ aming tor@@ ch .
so you mature later - and al@@ ps slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal covers heat .
the heat loss of one gram Mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as many offspring as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very big animal , however , should invest his resources in long life .
building floor in double pack

Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ xit
according to the competition in Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the City of Main has the best chances to tackle London &apos;s jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt most benefited from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ent Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the approval in the UK for the so @-@ called EU @-@ Pass is sufficient for them .
that just use big U.S. banks .
several banks have already announced that jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , un@@ ites responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as further important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , the organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the emergency database is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg is a major fund business , but also like Dublin as well as Dublin in the infrastructure .
thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
the city with easily available commercial property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the rent for the first @-@ class commercial property is 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and fewer crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the Mer@@ cer company , the city seats seven , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ ference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
for this also the correlation relations : in London , according to figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4000 people worked in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .

a US @-@ term judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the operating costs which you have created from Hep@@ at@@ its C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liberated of damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster medications called S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ eth@@ ic actions .

Mer@@ ck is attemp@@ ting to in@@ hibit the market of a new generation of hep@@ atitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness .
the case goes back to the year 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck took up mut@@ ually def@@ endants and property of laboratory work in which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir is basic , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .

Clin@@ tons Ear@@ n 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % of the federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published their tax return on Friday on Friday , and this revealed a revenue of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % on Friday .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics USD 1 million were donated to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton had generated almost USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aries ; former Minister of Foreign Ministers had an income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax ev@@ asion of the past ten years .
they paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; said Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ ag@@ hero@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion .
in a cr@@ ushing contrary , Donald Tr@@ ump hiding behind false expressions and re@@ treats in relation to his previous promises .
it is common to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidates , although they are not obliged by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for his ref@@ usal to control the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons electoral hel@@ pers in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter in terms of the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Advisor , CNN says that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax checks are not finished .
Tr@@ ump critics , including the rep@@ ubli@@ can Presi@@ dential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already re@@ asser@@ ted that his ref@@ usal questions concerning fortun@@ es , its donations for char@@ itable organizations , its business and various other compounds , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject of a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish its tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO announced that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers that could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a theme in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation which is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure that people earn more than USD 1 million with a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during a campaign for Hillary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett whose Ber@@ kshire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate invited its seat here , Tr@@ ump has to exchange their tax ev@@ asion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; buff@@ ett said he was as well as a tax examination of the IRS and Tr@@ ump did &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has published tax return to the year 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Clin@@ ics that now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , live , paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0,5 % .
the tax declaration of the 2015 Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that this is only USD 100 of its income as a salary , different from the majority of all Americans .
its main investment was a cost @-@ effective In@@ dex@@ ter@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income tax increased from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der , Fire@@ work Body fo@@ ster Tanz@@ anian Ele@@ ph@@ er
conservation of nature in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to stop eleph@@ ants from those inhabited sett@@ lements - they throw con@@ doms to them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ties .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already trained the idea of years ago , trained with the US nature conservation , trained to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method for protecting their houses and harvest without hur@@ ting animals .
before , many spe@@ ar used to defend itself .
Friday is a trading day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we could observe a change of their attitude in these mun@@ icipalities that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields , without harm the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the lighting of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and bli@@ sters in a horn .
when he is not scar@@ ed , a so called &quot; ch@@ ili@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end until the ignition is turned to the ignition .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom melt with a b@@ ang and spray fine dust to ch@@ ili powder into the air .
a hint is usually already out to ch@@ ase the eleph@@ ants .
one last option is a shi@@ pper who sho@@ ots a gold @-@ fired breast into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .

Jewish director cr@@ ushes the Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; claim - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media law after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel has not listed Israeli pre @-@ election in Berlin because the Arab guests would have requested according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country @-@ proposal list of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is that Israel eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via an own call center .
after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; I shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel asked that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , in the director , more anger dis@@ b@@ anded .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , &quot; the accused of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied from this event and troubled .
this is really very embar@@ rass@@ ing .
the fact that this has carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace .
no explanation requires that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet , where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
some sub@@ set to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been given the alleged alle@@ g@@ ations of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel is situated on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly demonstrated all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; for Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel is not included in the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung sent a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police relies on Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students embar@@ ked on Thursday at the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo together with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public image system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the protest@@ ers .
the difficulties started when police officers tried to deal with students , which led to the police of Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over plans .
according to the Government &apos;s proposals of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300.000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the Protest@@ ers saw Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provisional President Michel T@@ emer of walls .
the youngest protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators in masses went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the abol@@ ition of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade sum@@ p between Moscow and Teheran were equal to 7@@ 0.9 per cent in the year comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been abolished , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian companies take existing contacts with Iran , while new companies are ready to provide access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , another merchant is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the sales rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade show was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , Russian foreign nationals were about 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily as travel as rice , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries affecting the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only a few Russians visit Iran , something , from whom the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors hopes that it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received monuments of old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Sc@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner r@@ ushes home when Br@@ ite Gold is gu@@ essed for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner &apos;s final evening in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year old from Glasgow took the anchor on Sir Chris Ho@@ y who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who made the legend proud when he was going home to visit a victory of the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six olymp@@ ic openings .
they repeated the trick after arriving in March at the railway world championships in London , despite the return of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time when he was coming up .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man where they stayed when they saw the potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner followed an Olympic champion , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders victorious in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
he was back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a large part of transformation , when exec@@ uting in a higher gear in order to slow it down and allow it to slow the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they got to the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we have placed an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after his triumph in 2012 , Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys gave the way that he fell on the train after a weak start .
he later with@@ drew this statement later , and there was no ob@@ jection of Engl@@ ands ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with the victory of the victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win over the Olympics again .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven of 10 titles in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the past five months , we expect a successful five days in the bicycle stream .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the area of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition .
that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seem@@ ingly holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster ) , was also an yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the coming from Ho@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint which begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be beaten to k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ alli@@ ble competition of the day , but there were further good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ ak W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Four @-@ Four @-@ mil@@ eage race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had agreed yesterday with orders in front of the qualification , when officials called him to measure his body size .
at the deci@@ ding women competition , which will continue and end tomorrow , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and take a donation to medals .
after a truly extraordinary appearance of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations were shut down for Rio .
we played Dr@@ amas in the background , leaving the re@@ sign@@ ation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April am@@ id@@ st sex and bul@@ b@@ ing@@ ers , as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one sees itself the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like a legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment its cul@@ mination again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
future of melting production of Portland due to abol@@ ition of the energy contract .
the future of aluminium mel@@ ts by Portland , Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy supplier agreement and thus over@@ took all delivery contracts , such as the supplier of energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies to use the plant .
a payout for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland are located on the stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ating effects , as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as .
in 2014 , AL@@ CO@@ A closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melt of AL@@ CO@@ A in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure .
this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulation in the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the current rate for the system .
AG@@ L , which delivers the great aluminium mel@@ ter with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , told that three further owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of AL@@ CO@@ A and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which Chinese companies C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to continue to operate the plant in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; divided the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L further said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backup transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be entered into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month termination , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L will assume that the contracts in fiscal year 17 will contribute to income , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supply supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong data markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L told that the value of the contracts entered its annual cancellation of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AL@@ CO@@ A said that the decision to make contracts mark the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ as ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that it has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should come into effect from November this year , even if it is still a declaration , why it has been re@@ signed from the contract .
anal@@ ysts were war@@ med due to the poor economic conditions in the industry prior to possible closure of the Portland melt plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago complex near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of the anal@@ ysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume about 600 mega@@ watts and tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts of electricity .
if both plants disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator it would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ b@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Kend@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue
Kend@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US V@@ ogue .
Kend@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account .
&quot; in a room full of people who love , brought me the sight of this cover to tears , &quot; wrote Kend@@ all .
the unveil@@ ing of the co@@ vers a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family , which ends the cover of her sister and ended with a classic turn : they all have a surprise @-@ art@@ y planned .
this is the most c@@ lich@@ é action of almost every birthday episode ( Se@@ ac@@ nant brought the sentence , &quot; You thought that we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon by 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate in this public@@ ity somehow .
with regard to the September issue of V@@ ogue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
Kend@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her to hit the V@@ ogue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue is a league for himself .
the September issue is for V@@ ogue the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that is rather similar to a fashion magazine as a fashion magazine , the output pul@@ ls a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista from the 8@@ 32 pages of bearings 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the dis@@ closure of his co@@ er@@ stars is eag@@ erly a@@ waited that during the last two years , pictures of the magazine le@@ ak@@ ed even before the official announcement .
women who have already been on the cover comprise Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fam@@ ous times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models , the celeb@@ r@@ ities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the very small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ r@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today , knowing how to get a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything goes on J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women to draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like any success .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was somewhat cl@@ amped .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , critic@@ ized it &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings come up again , when the message came out with the publication J@@ enn@@ ers on the V@@ ogue Cover .
but riding on the miss@@ ile seems to pass by the point .
Kend@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the V@@ ogue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it works for Marc Jacobs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
you are sold by her done pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
community centers represent a total of 16@@ 0,000 people per year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the need require the country will be rejected by the community centers every year , while the industry makes for further mid @-@ term transactions to over@@ load transactions .
in Queens@@ land three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ fair del@@ ights and similar things - with their request for free legal advice and legal counsel .
legal services of the community , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts .
as of June , next year , further 30 percent of its federal funds will be lost .
the director of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Cent@@ res revealed that thousands of people had been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without the amend@@ ment of the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; Queens@@ land council centers are chron@@ ically financed , meaning thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said .
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debt , families that have been dismissed by divi@@ des - all these people have problems of right way and this survey showed that they can not get the help you need .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will reduce the funding by 30 percent from June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Queens@@ land will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and the Federal Minister of Justice and the Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to withdraw these middle distances immediately so that people may need help who need them with legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year the state government fulfilled their commitment to raise funds for the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of community centers and their customer communities as well as to invest the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after an employee allegedly drew weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indicted for alleged dis@@ activity after you have been told that their campaign leader for North Carolina was directed by a fire@@ arm in February , while they were traveling in a Jeep in February .
the incident was described in a bill of indictment which was filed on Wednesday in the state of Charlotte by Vincent Bord@@ ini , a former software programming for the campaign in this state .
Bord@@ ini gave up to have been waiting for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the battle manager , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moved a gun , laid his right index on the departure , and r@@ amm@@ ing the run in Vinc@@ ents K@@ nie@@ k@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Bord@@ ini in his charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having compl@@ ained at the local and regional camp@@ ground , Bord@@ ini pointed out that at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip , he gave in the bill of indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to al@@ ign damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bord@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indictment comes only two days after the rep@@ ubli@@ can presidential candidate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Second Am@@ end@@ ment People &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will take action to take action and appoint his rival Hillary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not rise to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ ord@@ is Compl@@ aint demands compensation from the campaign for violation of care@@ free movement and of Philip because of body injury and lasting damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps Press@@ es@@ pres@@ ch@@ erin Hope H@@ icks was not reachable for an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey on Länder elections : SPD and the CDU lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the SPD and the CDU .
this resulted in a representative p@@ olls of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to rain in the north , this is not possible after the values in Berlin .
in both German states , the SPD would have the strongest party , and would have had good chances to continue the government of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw the SPD from 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party , according to survey , only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is contest@@ ed between the left and AF@@ D .
the left came to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the AF@@ D would be represented by 19 percent first for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
in spite of a slight losses , the Gre@@ ens would be able to return to the s@@ words of Land@@ tag despite a slight losses ( previously 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD retired from the survey only to 23 percent ( 2011 election : 2@@ 8.3 per cent ) .
the CDU reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 percent .
it still stands behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but above the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the AF@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in a de@@ pu@@ ties .
at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would miss it in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Commun@@ ic@@ ator joined the market .
today , the successor domin@@ ates the world - its manufacturer had a disaster .
the weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
it was th@@ icker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite kno@@ cking .
at the beginning , the built @-@ in memory was eight Meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be rich in high resolution today .
an iPhone is now shipping with at least 16 gig@@ ab@@ ytes .
the &quot; Nokia 9000 Commun@@ ic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the Internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age .
however , 20 years ago the Commun@@ ic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the C@@ eb@@ it &apos;s computer fair in Hanover , as an &quot; office in West@@ er@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax it was the Commun@@ ic@@ ator .
even access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser , even though tor@@ so slowly .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be fli@@ pped like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. 1400 euros .
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could guess in August 1996 that Commun@@ ic@@ ator would become the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia .
the cell phone number of Finn@@ s experienced an un@@ preced@@ ented disaster . finally , it was sold and handled at Microsoft .
the market domin@@ ates the market today , which came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online and everywhere , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple accounts for about 5@@ 55 million of them alone .
global sales with equipment is around 400 billion euros .
the well @-@ running business of countless App @-@ providers and the telecommun@@ ications concert will come along .
around the smartphone has meanwhile emerged as a whole industry .
the crucial breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007 , then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the implementation of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the beginning of 2007 .
he promised three equipment in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen .
the victory of the Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had seen the night .
they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
we now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung .
the Smartphone is a self @-@ understanding for 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German today is looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone even once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s sphere , in the Siemens board of staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability now applies as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only going to place in our local communities and in London , but in the whole country of renewal and prosperity .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great advantages for Strat@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new possibilities for local and companies in the vicinity of He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities we will already have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs , creating an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment .
as they were prec@@ eded by us in London 2012 , there will be those who think the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ aze us on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers were wrong in 2012 and they will also lie with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to get over , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ .000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ness@@ ing wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and in whole GB .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has been implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infra@@ structures in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until T2 , which was built in the midst of the world &apos;s two frequ@@ ented drive .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
London &apos;s London games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time that we guide this Olympic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that can be proud of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad block@@ ages
according to one of the software production attempts , advertising block attempts to deal with an &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; will be equal to companies .
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that there would block indication on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertis@@ ements in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook was given that his desktop page would change the coding on its advertis@@ ements in order to identify the display , which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to understand .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a Blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the line @-@ temp@@ ting open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been underway since the invention of display break@@ ers in progress is &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media has settled in the struggle is a strong indication of how the wor@@ rying indication for the industry has become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people worldwide , according to a study ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the wor@@ ries of fac@@ ebooks .
the company has no effect on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on a fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue so Facebook will create the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook was told that it would update his &quot; ad pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over it from advert@@ ised advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would also block contents on the page that are no public@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for users , this is no positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a speaker from Facebook in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to place more control in the hands of the people .
woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway crossing
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police inv@@ okes witnesses after a woman crossed the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred near Morges in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police in Vau@@ d said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss franc in the age of 49 , which was driven by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , was to kill himself .
she died still on site .
several drivers have already heard , but some are still not identified , the police said these as well as any witness concerning the incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter before the Trib@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a c@@ lash avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver should not be held responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - where one person ran in the dark on the free@@ way - was decided that the drivers do not assume that a pede@@ stri@@ ans in the middle of the night run on the motorway as it was in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ e@@ woman was acquitted of neg@@ ligent killing , after killing a man and killed one night at the A1 , near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious of the street . he took the court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the court stated that the polic@@ eman -- who had rep@@ lied on a call for an justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Jud@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to projec@@ tions of a new NASA Musik@@ am@@ od@@ ells , the Venus was likely to be hab@@ itable once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model in order to discover the past of the Venus using tools and algorithms that re@@ semble air research .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by her dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly revol@@ ted .
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet found probably more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to host life and protected from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow reverse of Venus is exposed to their daily side of the Sun nearly two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , resulting in a umbrella due to a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the earth today .
the model brought out a history of Venus that resembles evolution that previously thought of Planet@@ arium researchers .
although it was presumably hab@@ itable to be hab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of billions of years .
her oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and its water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
when her Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers found the results of their new Venus climate change in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy joins the Aval@@ an@@ che Trainer
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a low @-@ determination decision as a decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have met my duties as Head of Head and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have thought long and have thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it needs to bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization .
he must also have a determination of the decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently being fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
he led the club to 112 points and on first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of Pla@@ yo@@ ffs from Minnesota and missed in any of the last two years .
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 stamp in the season 2015 @-@ 16 and fell behind the wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ h workers take up talks again , putting on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strug@@ gles regarding the wages for the North Sea Fle@@ et will be exposed as all of the dispute for a new meeting on the table , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; negoti@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spor@@ tive against the oil field service provider Wood Group has been carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to re@@ united the release process of the current stre@@ ak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a few full day sessions in the next weeks to start the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first to be in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year Wood Group has shortened the rati@@ os of its contra@@ sts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s advice follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contrac@@ tors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the necessary space to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shell has released for his part of thousands of people and announced plans to aband@@ on its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of his meg@@ ac@@ al action with the British energy company BG Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude prices under pressure , an economic situation that has increased by the British decision in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliamentary Council Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to discuss one of the biggest conflict in the North Sea since a generation in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Kepler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the newest mission with Kepler &apos;s teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ations under the stars of the star@@ dom .
the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers why stars in the star@@ ry are rotating at different rates as well as in what is the rotation @-@ tim@@ esp@@ ans with the planet origin .
&quot; we hope that through the compar@@ isons of our results with other star@@ ry , more about the relationship between the mass of a dying , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infrar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood .
you now turn the fastest .
to peak rot@@ ations , these mature stars encounter large amounts of stars .
because these winds travel through the stars of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each death by recogni@@ zes the time between appearance of an recogni@@ zable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- recognis@@ es .
the latest catalog of rotation @-@ rates indicates that massive stars slower than a less massive star .
re@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , while fighting faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ations .
&quot; the star@@ ry of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is much more to tell us about how the How , when , when and why stars will slow down their rot@@ ations and so to hang up their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail on their latest analysis of rotation @-@ rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star k@@ icks off
the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base at Alex Rodri@@ guez .
following his emotional withdrawal announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will carry out the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 , against T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated .
three times , Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been compl@@ ained about 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
by the end of December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as consultants and youth coach at the end of December 2017 .
as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es a few mil@@ est@@ ones .
with the Hall of @-@ of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values .
nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old does not have to be included in the rest of the base .
for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his occurrence from the place of place .
already in 2009 , the super@@ star was given to &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; between 2001 and 2003 and banned from ster@@ oids .
in August 2013 , he was closed to 211 games due to a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal at the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main susp@@ ect for years to obtain funding from an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I had done 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not running sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bank .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who with the actress Cameron Di@@ az was married and the actress Kate Hudson has been told , sympathy with friends of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ al Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; the supporters of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ insky are the first d@@ oping cases
cat@@ ching : because of a positive d@@ oping rehear@@ s@@ ard Adrian Ziel@@ inski may not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - the 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official d@@ oping accidents .
a w@@ asted Ath@@ let@@ in would have won almost a medal .
prior to the seventh race event , the first official d@@ oping cases of Rio de Janeiro have become known .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre @-@ obstacle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been tested positively in Brazil - immediately before the beginning of the anyway critical athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to an accident .
in Chen was also proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as mas@@ ked means for dop@@ amine substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of Agriculture confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only around 0.0@@ 9 seconds , they missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Chen would have said about 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
Chen has applied the opening of the B sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires Chen &apos;s co @-@ operation with the exam@@ inations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court of Europe and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C but the CAS for san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases .
likewise , during the night of Rio , the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the lightweight athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report it is said to act in the forbidden substance to deal with the blood vessels EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been pro@@ vision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w immediately responded with criticism of the Ath@@ let@@ in word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are Bulgarian under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , about all weight theat@@ res may not take part of the infl@@ ammat@@ ory nation in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic team in class up to 85 kg , as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z was tested positive for three days prior to the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both spr@@ ite the in@@ gest@@ ion , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ owa case is a further heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception due to systematic d@@ oping d@@ oping , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , in addition , the earlier trials in China had taken care of the athletes .
thus the Fren@@ chman Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to pass , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a confron@@ tation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and respect for d@@ oping frau@@ ds , &quot; said this .
sun was positively tested on the stim@@ uli Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a triple locking .
dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de squee@@ zing h@@ acker your ran@@ som
program@@ mers of press@@ ors currently use targeted companies - and are successful here .
according to a recent survey of malware @-@ Defense @-@ specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of survey@@ ed firms have at least once , partly multiple victims of attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies already have the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims are willing to re@@ adily be willing to use the required sol@@ dering costs for the requested systems and data to be used again .
the crimin@@ als speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observ@@ ations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes in addition to attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to er@@ aser ran@@ som is much higher than in private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rator discovered software for itself .
only private users had the aim , but the change to company attacks were sc@@ ary quickly in the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , it searches for targeted files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently the software presents the demands of black@@ mail .
to get the final code for the files , the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin .
but where in private users the personal photo database is based on the game , it works with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage fails when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had to completely inter@@ rupt the business activity , in case of a case , people were in danger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by loss of health prevention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not pay , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies , pay , get their data back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators in the operation of a stand@@ still .
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure have examined the usage areas and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators actually try to build a kind of service to take more money .
you explain your victims by chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , judge freely accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files .
and if private people dis@@ solves the payments of a few hundred Euro , companies must act hard and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to back their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming professional and share the job , declar@@ ing security experts K@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
more likely , it is that it is three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits created by the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then seek more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly caught software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so , in one of the forums in the underground , the set purchases from a crimin@@ als and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per content calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies IT responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey have confidence to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware using File Back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursu@@ ing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful creation , the perpet@@ rators thre@@ aten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for instance , the potential for damages depending on the type of data is still higher than before .
the perpet@@ rators could also have completely new goals in the internet of things into the grain .
on the ground conference of defe@@ con demonstr@@ ating security researchers as they could get a thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpet@@ rators then put an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be subject to industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda will un@@ pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little Cou@@ pe and also the versat@@ ility of a min@@ iv@@ ans .
sounds rather un@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , is actually quite flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row as well as in the rear .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ processed and work pleasant , just the cockpit side falls off there .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a luggage boot of 4@@ 53 l at raised and 10@@ 26 l in reverse the back of the back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is less magical , than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be mounted like chin @-@ chair and offer storage space that is high from the ground up to ceiling 1,@@ 24 m high .
the trunk height can be loaded well , however , the load height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speed .
his work is likely to do something silent .
the daily consumption of the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine support : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be somewhat more direct .
the equipment in the tested top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; has no wishes to be desired .
the City emergency braking system is one of the safety systems ( works to pace 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the spa coach .
the coll@@ ision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates , because he dis@@ car@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ating objects . &quot;
the remote light is very reliable .
and the intelligent temp@@ o control is respon@@ ding to the traffic sign detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t when you need the speed .
but the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two USB@@ - and an HDMI connector lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to reach .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ 000 Euro .
the engines comply with the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and everyday @-@ day car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on flight bridge
an airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
for a liability is only th@@ ink@@ able with dangers that are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ed the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff broke down with the overthrow of a kne@@ ec@@ tor@@ ment .
however , the accident could have been everywhere - it &apos;s a general risk of life , such as judgment .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
illness : when paid the organizer
after their journey , he only got money back when the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate to find in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests proved to show the same symptoms .
in this case , a family was heavily ill in diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting with a family on the second day .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease led to a defective se@@ wage plant which allegedly poll@@ uted sea water .
the family was the view , the journey would have been in@@ sufficient - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success before court .
indeed , the wast@@ e@@ water situation was actually defective .
but the organizer learned just before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the se@@ a@@ water was fine .
he did not hurt his information , so the verdict .
in the samples of water , no contam@@ in@@ ants were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by infection among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
only 38 guests were sick of 6@@ 91 guests .
Mai@@ zi@@ ère said that many people were concerned by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people are worried about further attacks .
the state so@@ aps and decided to react on terror at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators .
we will not allow this triumph to terrorists .
if off@@ ender had to leave the country more quickly , this is the security and strength of the population for refugee policy .
Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve implementation of proposals by 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ e@@ tion for terrorism again will stand under punishment .
video surveillance should be improved , the case is correct so that all of the purchase of weapons in the Internet is being re @-@ added .
the last many discussed sec@@ rec@@ y light for physi@@ cians should stay in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with anger , as the end@@ an@@ gering of citizens can be dimin@@ ished , he said with a look at mental ab@@ normal@@ ities .
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support .

in prosecution of criminal crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to implement the deployment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD chief Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister is clearly pronounced against shareholder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the hin@@ ge in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel , Gabriel , said the papers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ator ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship before .
a general ban on authority has been legally problem@@ atic for constitutional .
you can &apos;t offer everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of Bur@@ ka .

better traffic flow on the motorway zu@@ br@@ inger
it st@@ resses regularly on the walk road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
however , this should change : the legal b@@ ulation shall be prolonged .
this is good news for all car rac@@ ers , which are at work on the ambient road every evening at St@@ au when they drive across the motorway ( A 43 ) .
road construction is extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer and the descent Wes@@ eler Straße , the right @-@ winding lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then drive directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the great advantage : traffic shares up early , ensuring that the overall sequence on the busy section of the Bundes@@ strasse 51 is improved .
the idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the road train at the Zu@@ br@@ inger explo@@ res the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days extends back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ h path and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the sof@@ tw@@ ood on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ eler Street .
from here , traffic is only chann@@ elled on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be re@@ constructed a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge doesn &apos;t have the required lifting force to absorb the heavy duty .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related stag@@ nation will last , the national company cannot say .
however , years to reck@@ on : for the bridge has an official rem@@ nant time of up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ur , the country has deliber@@ ately chosen the bu@@ zz over the school holidays because with disabilities .
traffic is run on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the building site .
Inter@@ cultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
the international class of forest school attended the theatre piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people to visit with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .

since the beginning of the year , the association offers cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome leave the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
most of the yo@@ ungst@@ ers of the class are between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German .
thanks to the choreograph@@ ies , scenic images and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the action process but the press release of the Young Theatre in Münster .

offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ cal language transmission are in the planning stages .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
because of the increased number of refugees , the association is reck@@ oned with many classes that want to participate .
rain instead of stars : hope for weather repair
the weather has made the star of the stars in southwest Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany over night - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain , the chairman of the sky spectac@@ le , said the chairman of the Stern@@ warte Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night for Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many star@@ ters in the sky .
among the stars , Per@@ ei@@ des , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometres per hour , is one of the fastest star@@ ters .
they have their name because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the north east .
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
in the evening , one gets etern@@ ally awake , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning , far before the wake @-@ up rings , do no longer think of sleep .
this is all other than relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently recovered than not recovered .
how do sleep problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes underlying them , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , member of the German Society for Schla@@ ff@@ ing and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you understood among them , is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an insight and a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance .
straight through the sleep , many people feel as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the German House Physi@@ cians with practice in the lower Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it , organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be stuck , but also medicines .
not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early wake @-@ up is especially frequent during a depression , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß .
and it can be that different factors deliber@@ ate each other .
who for example has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up all two to three hours and begin to sal@@ v@@ ably on everyday problems and care to p@@ onder@@ ing , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces to the doctor ?
those who do not sleep well for a period of a month in at least three nights per week , should be imp@@ aired by the doctor , advis@@ es We@@ e@@ ß .
the imp@@ air@@ ment can look quite different : it is sm@@ itten , tired , un@@ ru@@ ined , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is slightly irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical dis@@ comfort such as stomach or head@@ aches .
to relie@@ ve the sleep disorder , it is important to find out their causes .
the options are subject to behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ oral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quire .
in Germany , Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etz@@ e , head of the inter@@ disciplinary Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , hardly emphas@@ ised in Germany .
therefore , at bed@@ time , one should first turn to the physi@@ c@@ ologist , We@@ e@@ ß is advis@@ ing .
it can clari@@ fy with studies , whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens there ?
to study in the sleep laboratory , medicine , for example , for snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory messages , in case of illness , or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder , explains Fi@@ etz@@ e .
we don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etz@@ e .
after the wired one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes in the body , one carries a nas@@ al g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a antenn@@ ae on the finger .
the camera also shows a camera on the ceiling .
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many pitch screws on which you can place for a better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß is up to : regular sleep and fir@@ ing times , not to be long in bed , not to sleep on the day , not watch television to sleep , stop drinking alcohol and at night did not start at night - then you begin to get right away , and that is absolutely not helpful .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V @-@ Team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the Kurz@@ eme World Championships in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has placed himself on Facebook protecting his ex @-@ team@@ mates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country in which a Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle member $ 15@@ 0,000 should not be surprised about missing medals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page in the night on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , the d@@ oping controls were very good .
we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a lot , and can not even be seen as precisely or operate on the topic of D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not saying that the checks should be adjusted &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
it should be exactly like that with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled by independent controllers in the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A while the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A cannot compete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls for the Hamburg @-@ Hamburger , who now operates a ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Bag@@ di@@ vines arrested
professional Die@@ be at Airport Düsseldorf
civil f@@ ahn@@ ders of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ect had done several hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and baggage ste@@ els .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants recognised a gang in the area of Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport , which was known for police officers from past theft .
the two women and two men had committed several dol@@ ences since mid @-@ July and were very professional , working and especially professional .
the specialists of the Criminal Court 34 can re@@ prove the th@@ ie@@ ves which have travelled to Germany for off@@ setting criminal off@@ ences to Germany .
they were exploited for a total of over 15,000 euros .
old buildings , a few len@@ ders , in between still a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone p@@ av@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not affect the first glance , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
walk along the road from east to west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone &quot; ugly &quot; on the facade of a grey house ! &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which is to be demolished soon , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the competent property company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , are however preferred by burning cars in the last weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Berlin internal sen@@ ator Henkel had repeatedly expressed themselves for a tough approach of police against the project , the area as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 22 June the rooms were evacu@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , had been pat@@ ched with 300 to 40 official officers and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors to enter the house with number 94 .
during its renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administ@@ rative Court decided that the clearing was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers led under the ju@@ ggle of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained in late afternoon .
in the immediate vicinity of the skin projects a primary school and nur@@ ser@@ y gardens are located .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , which collec@@ ts three children , are generally generated by the police presence .
with the residents of the hood projects they share wor@@ ries before increasing ten@@ sions and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to bring up multi @-@ sc@@ andal@@ ous Left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police arise between house networks and their neighbours , apparently doesn &apos;t exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working district , which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty .
also home networks and the native residential projects have long been part of the Kiev country : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including almost the entire main@@ board street in the vicinity of the Rig@@ a@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer had been vac@@ ated under the right side of police , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ s and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly difficult for tourists and voting liner from all over the world : with them now residents of GDR times and former home network share their max@@ im .
this can also be felt with the rent , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ s are being attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them on raised disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades which have been subjected to cra@@ vings .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
one reason for that not all neighbors could consider it as a problem , that it is not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes involve tangible damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disp@@ uted 94 , there can be no talk of un@@ certainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what acts of violence is it important : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people in the 94 are their neighbours , who would not have been this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars can no longer give it in the Rig@@ s no longer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architecture , its road is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and receives more from each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliber@@ ately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
this is why it was also so important that the local people had their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all had the interpretation of the district .
but in the eyes of habit@@ ants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : by un@@ loose new buildings in former buildings that impos@@ e the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are all right @-@ con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can &apos;t be gu@@ thei@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone is listening ?
there is a fru@@ stration at all sides , even in the police and the residents .
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , has little understanding : the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who are moving , should be aware - just like someone who moves into a bar district , can complain badly about noise .
all persons presented only with previous names have asked to be called by their right name
Ur@@ bach : An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee tragedy
An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partnership in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ues supports the management team at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and who else involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le now is there , the je@@ al@@ ous wool mel@@ low , which primarily has a problem .
so some - less mo@@ cking than rather the multitude of desired application areas was purpos@@ eful - meant when the administration wanted to write the place .
sought a management expert with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long@@ standing experience in the field of social work , a skilled wool mel@@ low .
but administration work is not its central area , An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le means .
above all , it is an organisation to work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for around six weeks .
it has taken a 50 percent mark on three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer that An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Hon@@ ey and main actors are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and understanding problems .
new containers are soon available in the Was@@ enstraße
it has been a serious problem for some time , apartments for connecting refugees , which have been recognized .
the mun@@ icipalities are responsible for the supply of the connection .
they need to accommodate refugees in own or rented residential premises .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es itself .
the responsibility changes from land rats to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
de facto , administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it doesn &apos;t work , so you should rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be rep@@ lic@@ ated as it is so beautiful .
soon new containers will be erected in the water road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the cat@@ ch@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le are natur@@ alized .
in addition to a fixed lead , there are inter@@ ns places , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and helpful activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or furnished .
&quot; more places were good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help house master , doing char@@ itable work - and the motivation and very neat , as An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
it is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but does not just mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , tell Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop an adequate feeling .
so special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional classes are rare .
so it also starts administration and volunteer .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are desired in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain the refugees that it lasts , and they can bridge the time meaningful , for example with language courses .
those who make the feeling of develop , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , I will never be in@@ corporate .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this was already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do both of the latest inci@@ dents are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What man@@ cher may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a chance could not exclu@@ de it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensiti@@ zed .
these inci@@ dents are subject to the refugees too .
they would be afraid that the attacks bring them completely in demand .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honorary local must look on site and in the region to activities .
they have always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a limit ?
the policy is clear to answer this question .
actually , it is un@@ fair to place hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there where we want to go , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher also makes it possible to in@@ corporate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , they have to help them , both women are lonely .
the political situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
