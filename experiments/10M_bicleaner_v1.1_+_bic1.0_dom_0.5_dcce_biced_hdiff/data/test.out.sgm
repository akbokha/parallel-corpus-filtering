<seg id="1">Clintons and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">In infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential election results in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">The matter about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts still small in doubt, as the state of economy may harm - with taxes and regulators.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to punish the economy to death and regulate the economy, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be completely different, assert Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will return regulators heavily, and it will be strong for a wide tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Both stakeholders are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the muts, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure is a classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So, on trump, partial internal discussions could be said.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and resume the coal transport in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil extraction should also be possible in far-protected areas, the Paris climate agreement wants to announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment program and demands:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only for infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpaziish trade agreement, do both not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both the U.S. do not want to isolate international trade, but just like American jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They should get paid even better, but calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this matter is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he might not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the next months would probably be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On one side, Trump stands, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics keep him, so the budget deficit would only grow bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "on the other hand, Clinton is asking that at least from the rich wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say:" "" "more taxes are not the solution." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost every day.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby, which is at most one year old.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentral accommodations for all-wing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>

<seg id="38">On the question of whether they knew from a similar project as in Munich, some of them respond with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">There is no such thing in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken.</seg>
<seg id="40">Even in Schwaben alone, some voluted women are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press review of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mittelfranken there are floors or private houses only for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Deputy representatives of the assistants have called their union to approve new labour measures in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) required its entire Council to approve more labour measures at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that it was a minister to sow the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">Assistants and medical students enrolled in July on the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the BMA.</seg>

<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>

<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved like never had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me, his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to see what he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the period was wasted.</seg>

<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the nationally controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>

<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin had received the apology from president Erdogan, who wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a truce is clear on the hand.</seg>

<seg id="28">"" "" "" "repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey took him shaken." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions are hard hit by Turkey - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, travel agencies and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State TV forecasted vegetables and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemosti summarized it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike on it is to draw benefits from the cool mood and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian President in Ankara gained a bonus for the attempted coup d "état in Ankara following the attempted coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is a sense of self-understood that even a deep fear of regimes has changed.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "the summit meeting in this glittering palace in the sea has enabled Russia and Turkey to depict" "" "an analyst once described," "" "Alliance of external sides" "" ": two countries that move from the West and feel poorly treated and allied." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave himself the role as a peace of peace, but where Russia and Turkey supporting opposing sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant, that after almost three hours, both presidents say on the press conference that they hadn't once touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey refused to answer a question about their differences while Putin decided to emphasize them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about it, where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Russian President Vladimir Putin had to offend his staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was part of the close friend of Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an opinion of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who was Deputy Chairman since 2012, was appointed as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972 in Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin website it is called (in Russian) that he later became the head of the government and the leader of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state of bills and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the Russian TV station on Friday, Putin told that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Are the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of the closest friends Vladimir Putin and works as he worked for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff came back to his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - above all, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who was employed as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks on Putin that are cited on the website of the Kremlin, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say to trust this very complicated item for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the position in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and is a member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Council (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once Ivanov was accepted after Putin's second term president of Russia, there would have been a third term of coup against the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close ally, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="7">The project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland Crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of a engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a finicky activity which require extremely precise tolerances for fitting.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of nearly 79% of the bridge decks in their place and the last section of the deck will get a bed base for the deck today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">With this fantastic project the closure of the trendsetting up-looking high and deep building represents.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road section and its connection with the Nordturmodeck, we had to close the already existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern periphery of 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, about 6,000 tons are weighing and at an incline of about 3% had to be drawn up.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "" "" Handle concept "" "" to the next council session. "" "</seg>
<seg id="5">But conflict is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, it is about the question: who should build the favorable apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "the SPD-Group president Christoph Bratmann means:" "" "we are happy with the Greens:" "" "those who want to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments may, however, may also be built on the stocks.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "but the big dispute in the city hall was, however, so Bratmann:" "" "how to build on private faces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want to build investors at least 10 percent, but 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing program, which will cost millions and is still financed, should provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The problem, so Bratmann: "there is no agreement between the fractions."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU want to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants harshly harshness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Regardless of the way, Bratmann, whipped the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not completely different: for around 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does it compare to loss of more than 1300 advantageous apartments, whose funding will run out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">To prevent this, according to the planning policy, Nicole Palm, should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">Moreover, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back to the price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western town.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem can be solved on one fell swoop.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the West city the end of the year will run from the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could get back in the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, which pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to look how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenager and child not go outside, but rather, prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, was sued on screens in the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">With Pokemon Go it's about to get people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was at the beginning on the TV, then limited to video games and last on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">I take a look at the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later on a drawing series, cards, and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many phenomena of pop culture, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand sunk in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was shifted by massive demand that overload the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pokémons who are followed with a GPS and once they have been found," "" "photographed" "" "(about a screenshot on the phone) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the USA the game led to a considerable increase in steps that puts the" "" "average" "" "person every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, prosecuted 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 percent, followed by 45 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "to come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active on deaf ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look like." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of advantages, which is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful an Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people go hunting even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there is also mürrical game, which always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough for itself.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like Fitbit could follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its attraction, and the use will fail.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people on hunting, active, fitter, and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine among the women's Olympic team in the turnes and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US had never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly, this team has three turists, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Hernandez, who inspired for many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewin and Madison Kocian, the catholicin is round, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "it fixed the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years number one was one of the female Turnergies a Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year, Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising winning winner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to be the incredible performance of the three times world champion in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they were awaited, but masterful Gymastikemen.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won in an individual meeting event for women's gold.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the tip of this sport, but we do not see trainers in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie beat all the same way as Aly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five," "" "because the next Olympic team will only have four turists in the team. besides, it is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks like that Turnen is an expensive sport and Turner will be held primarily in private gyms, which are maintained for training, setup, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainer and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs, who can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will receive its entire training and that is for the families a devout and long-term commitment.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainee of Laurie Hernandez, have started their athlete since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired by the municipalities Aun countless, young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a capacity and easier to access.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gyms of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">With my events we have offered free and affordable turf in Harlem for over 15,000 young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer youth-quality turnes that make the opportunity to learn and benefit from this amazing Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnes develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness to the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination provides life-long advantages for health and training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the Olympic team golds and thank you so many young girls with different background motivates to begin their way to get healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you're approaching your front or behind, this video will show you how you turn the skewer for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "when you turn back from behind, then you should turn right out so you can see your attacker and go out of the line" "", "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon from your front arm and shoulder before you hit him with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him then with the knees into the crust and rotate, while the attackers are collapsible before pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run and move backwards while they judge the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">When attackers approaching, the technique is similar - move your body from the line, take the weapon and rotate it, so the attacker cannot shoot.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue to the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent his immune system and stimulated a serious test - by taking some of the dirty and most polluted places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk will leave his course on a euro bill, a handheld at Piccadilly Circus, a flush with a train shower and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaving every object he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to settle.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to lick the purge of a drawtoilet, which has been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke about doctors and medical professionals to promote intestinal bacteria and their own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left behind him, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to the rinsets of toilets, the task set his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he told:" "" "as a kid I was relatively unworried about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was appointed to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its promo showed a luminometer count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the Luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after its Luminometry was above 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes to the worst thing I smoked in a toilet, close." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here, because it is here inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch, and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstormings that ended that we told "Lass us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them in a bigger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information about an interesting way." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Tom Hakala, who led the film direction, added:" "" "let me have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have put my respect for Ian, that I have instructed him for some of the things I have instructed him, such as the eclecting Russian toilet which will be shown in the film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick it and others where this was pretty difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In one of the survey conducted by validation of 84 per cent of all respondents, 84 per cent of all respondents were associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least use products that contain lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">With this a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstone masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the classic temple and filled with the role of Mary a youth nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the orchestra the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of Venezuelan Dirigenten Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he is blackened.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that she is very Latin.</seg>

<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>

<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Mary.</seg>

<seg id="3">They have understood in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country code will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the central parliament decided already at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">As far as so far it does not work: summer holidays, heat and land baldness - that bites you.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced of the soldiers, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the tourists who are in the country are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so we must not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">For this purpose, practical problems: in the holidays are helpers, distributing posters, flyers, flyers and end up the end of voices, only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to leave for election campaign close to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, when one can tell that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be feared by his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clear in surveys behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strong newcomer AFD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition dust.</seg>

<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were last with 22 percent behind the CDU (25), only slightly ahead of AFD (19).</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For the responsible works of the construction, which begin at 5.30 a.m. and end until 20 o'clock, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything pretty rocky," Elvira Tetzlaff tells us from the jet fuel station.</seg>

<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated at the weekend of the half-time schedule, until the end of October everything will be completed.</seg>
<seg id="8">The opposite will also be the subject responsible for the construction works, e.g. when it comes to the establishment of container cruises.</seg>

<seg id="14">What led to that mancher trucks left in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27-Refurbishment has led to their sales freres, everyone, whom you ask, can look through.</seg>

<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have taken it hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">It is missing the customers of Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>

<seg id="34">He must have dismissed half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, ruling Jörg Schmidt, on a request by Göhner, whether there might be a financial balance, the hospitality would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they also have the disadvantages provided by the rehabilitation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where something more generous was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to pass.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family operation has been established here in 1715, it refers to the long history of history.</seg>
<seg id="40">Now, other regular guests are now going to do less often due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">That his regular clientele came back after the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts about it.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its own history in its long-term history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination records: who buys record records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men like middle age-like plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you face the comment section, in order to overlay it under the pseudonym of non-alleginity of men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much spoken resignation of sound tiles is not attributable to a millennials boom that lead the curiosity of physical objects, but attributable to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record, are all foresight in the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable cask group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by Hobbysammers - it has an emotional meaning: older record purchasers rather retain their feelings for itself (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I keep in the middle of a busy road in Soho, a modest grey suit, and I will stop my hands." "" "so, let's take a closer look at it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Although the heart of Sohos is slowly adding to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to place the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (Data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These sound boards, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed at home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to purchase plates that he could not afford to buy and buy items which he sold as he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70's, who was released when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees to those who buy records, rather introverted and gladly spend time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my master.</seg>
<seg id="22">NEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray also believes that many customers he meets Yougov's profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">Of the conversations which I have led, people usually have emptied themselves around 1998 or 1999 of their collection.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom of followers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a store such as Phonica to recognize that record shops offers a calming community of equities.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to return to the stability of familiar sound platforms, of objects, the happiest cheekeepers.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possessing the possession of materiality as a kind of comfort," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collectors and I think it is so in many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social worker!" "" "a staff of a flat stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month they have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% have a record player who never use them while 7% of those who buy a record, no turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried while passing through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Data number: three men of middle ages) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone recently came here and said," "" "I don't have a turntable, but I would like to buy a radio record, so I can put it to the shelf" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product heavy, less music.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no turntables." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, which are very slowly clean.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has dedicated the silverplates almost a whole floor, has a blower audience when I clean.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women of middle ages.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sexypackers pop instead of experimental jazz - is it good to see such a diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange, but brand psychological traumata are hard to find when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannequcer than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't earn much, so collecting panels is not a real option, it says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives with a loving sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfit.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I admit that jeans hotter I observe, I observe a group of young teenager who are grouping for a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are considering to buy a Crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody looks at her - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far as it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for those items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one who gives out most of luxury objects like plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of Yougov agree, they can at least exist in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, turntables, and in Onlineforen.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard in school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursdays tomorrow with security not by disk operations of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the eye of an unfurious, 30-year-old false moderator who rises nothing of the middle aged men above the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain's 7-er Rugby arrived in the final on Thursday evening to a abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 im Deodoro Stadium in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in the handling, side Stepping, Surrender, Line of Line and raw, to win gold - their first Olympic gold medal.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept away by the non-bad trophy of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have been defeated in this form a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it is likely not - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis boss Ben Ryan, the former boss of England for Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game of Ryan with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This loop will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attack of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at that time one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 out as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner which he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly got the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A striking mass of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann from Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it has only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and still gave it over a minute of play... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou was prejudiced by other weak tactics of the GB teams and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion carried out a 29-0 to the pause.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while the UK still learnt.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is like that too.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced basic changes to half-time by and closed the fijianic gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, until Joshua did go through to Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton began an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was already long in favour of the South-sulate, whose fans sang, flags swings and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire Fijis's playable approach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the i-bag with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Pfiff rang out, the Fijis embraced and the GB kicked off crushing in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Previously on the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in semi-final with 20-5 and the UK urged South Africa to a scarctly match from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the bucks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate under the post in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-sixth team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by battle with the cancer of the trainer to the rowing victory</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no engine in gold than those games, and that will mean something like that.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder to the last, 220 hard Hieve, who enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment on Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Although there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams was at present when she ruined her second Olympic champion without tax wife in a row, the first women in the history of British Sports, which submitted such a standard.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter was useless, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athletes that glides over the surface with the elegance of swabs, which is not reflected the way of the Arc de Triomphe.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the ruin a battalion is dependent on the helpers that make the difference, and there was no more thanking than the trainer, who had not been able to survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had my bladder cancer, which is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio were lucky that he could begin the treatment in early 2014, out of season, what was the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station around 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is already a challenge, but this makes it a bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the ingenesis of the victory their first thought of Williams, who had a nervenous morning, spent a bit more than to speak, and trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning, who was the centurion in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," "" "I was this week an emotional wreck. this might be something extremely rare but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It's repeated only how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best coach in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I could not have wished for a better person or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pair had a hard rhythm, with whom their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "lead in the process, lead in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to not get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not going to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="33">We wanted no fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, going out and win the race which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The pair will take a break for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that my last race was.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">In London it took about six months to conceive that I am a Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all that new to me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">That feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied URSEL Kipp for their whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher college, she reserved the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old singing in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physical," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, they feel balanced, cheerful and a lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way they are doing something good in their health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For singing is equal to several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hiker says of the German senior senior League.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in chorus and sharing with like-minded people of music, he describes Hiker.</seg>
<seg id="8">Being regular together, Seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and familiar structures in the age of age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made URSEL Kipp in her choir:" "" "ask and organise themselves on the others to learn and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of collective." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, says Hiker means.</seg>
<seg id="12">For the seniors exercise a deep and controlled respiration.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anyone who calls his lung regularly is not so fast in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even if it comes to obtain the sound of voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of Seniors Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher position, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observed that singing or listening of songs by older people wakes a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">By lyrics and particularly melodies, Dementious people withdrew from a long withdrawn events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing the head is also required a special performance, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on their own voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just older people who live alone so don't just practise on himself.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, Hiker means.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show itself: if I am long for something, I'll get better and watch over me - this experience is strengthening.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing with singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, do not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - with 50 sinful people who can hear when a sound is next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of suitable offer, Seniors have several options, says Hiker.</seg>
<seg id="30">Someone sings from the acquaintance circle in an veteran enchyor, you can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn right to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can find many senior choirs on the Internet too.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who would like to sing, should be sure to join a choir, says Hiker.</seg>

<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed publication of retrofitting reports," "" "said the morality among analysts and" "" "gave a little space for different opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "but Mr. Schiff and Democrats said no clues on a" "" "White House" "" "intervention in CentCom Analysts at a" "" "certain political opinion" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Preliminary results of the investigations were published on Tuesday through "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times of investigations were reported by the Pentagon's general inspectors that were taken after complaints by CentCom Analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press report of the Pentagon, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress of Defense during the investigations of the General Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also announced that" "" "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data and that the Secretary of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have impacted the question of a successful air campaign among American leaders in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>

<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government proposals, had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, because these provisional refineries had been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates of the American field hockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five gates in two games should actually show a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said they couldn't remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know, however: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Britons on the first place to remain undefeated in Japan after their 2-0 victory.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet in the last game of the first round on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two of the two teams will get the first and second place within their group.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first platinum will take a little bit longer from the path that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, Americans have triggered a surprising host through its success story, four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 courses.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a Hockeybat in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a national player in the USA, the youngest in the history of this team.</seg>
<seg id="13">They missed the Olympics in 2008, as it could not qualify for the cadence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, where she and her team went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year, Craig Parnham, a British, trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the working order in London, which we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have to pull the ruin completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doorstep in the first half of the game with a setback from the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="20">India was without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the play from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game in her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and lupin the ball in the gate to get a 2-0 guide to the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goal of the USA, Jackie Briggs, which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amidst the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, the Olympic Games are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly growing and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and spreading.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is, as if the Olympic torch is self a burning staff, which is protected from the Crossbow to Turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot listen to the TV, read a newspaper or listen when talking about your neighbours in the queue in the coffeshop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovering y or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman of women with dimples, could quite have been sent by sponsors and well-being-TV advertising when he would be a swimmers, Turner, or even Freal.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting in the Olympic trampolines for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit up every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports which are not widely recognized: air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I would like to make arguments for my specific darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping around since 2000 has been an Olympic event, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years has been so exacerbated that many that I asked, did not know that it's a Olympic Port.</seg>
<seg id="14">That could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "although the USA was sent to the competition, it has never won a medal in a trampoline and until 2012 has had a athlete, who made it until the end of 2012." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian who shared the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping is a certain outdoor space, partly because it sounds suitable for the uncleared ear for a clownsschule as the music for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a bound enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending inflating - but also the Grazie of gyms and diving, the two sports which combines it essentially.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as the springboard. "</seg>
<seg id="22">The winner jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, hreal and saltos) before landing at the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">You will be evaluated according to the official Olympic programme, difficulty level and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and down, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also in the TV broadcast another highlight: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The targeted streak is nobel, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to even stir up an audience with tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think about this games as a bit tired.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers an attic.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prunes, seemingly heavy as an astronaut, goes up, then upward, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a contest, of course not without difficulty, but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, just the dreaming, elegant lift of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualifications and ducks of women will be held Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also around 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-time as a part of a follow-up bloc on both days and 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to overlook in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase of consciousness is achievable only by angulation and objectification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base to Mr. Dooley.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters, the political changes in Ethiopia demand violent opposition to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that a protest during clashes were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>

<seg id="7">"" "" "" "but in recent months protests against the government shakened the country and spread themselves in increasingly more areas." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people hit the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer to the government was merciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot to unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "moving videos on protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security professionals suggest young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Authority for Human Rights now requires a detailed investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to stop this country and in future it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, an Research Group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror and fight against the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure improved dramatically - there is a new swing train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations are constantly led by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively brought into silence." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned, killed or pushed into the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and they don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the land use to digging in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a considerable critical election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tension ascends along the border to Eritrea; a fight for these tender, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts believe that separatists like the Oromo-liberation front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which could be forced more or less in recent years, could use turmoil and could be armed.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitter feelings after years of incankles should now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate through social media, since cheaper smartphones were becoming more common and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially during protests, many people still can communicate via Internet Proxies that hide, where they can stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave to that they gathered themselves so much protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since Äonen prospered the Amharas, which come from Äthopia mostly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are exploited for Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat regions.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that's just changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are here to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the regions of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have seen the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for around 6 percent of the population, and which are dominant in the military, in commerce and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-public illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly amused to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to work opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime is missing in this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively dense reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the region of the Tigray region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to analysis apparently by the government, expelled and stolen by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following Razors many protesters were killed, even if there were fewer than in the last months, and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructures, such as the new pendulum train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">Obviously, this does not prevent the intensification of the internal misery of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protesters in Gondar, a amhardy city, run by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is always more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests will bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently told that she concluded this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to support democracy clearly, he doesn't want his ally collapsing in a volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think too, he is smart enough to keep his words vague so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>

<seg id="21">But as he reinforces attention in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps joke his loyal fellow-stretching back into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocant may be his testimony.</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Shiff Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and is swimming with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Grönagricultural sharks along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour, it reaches 1,220 metres far in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it comes to it, the five metre-long animal accelerates to a full length 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle of loneliness seems to be a sponsor concept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least from a Grönlandhai, who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "commented Alexander Schmonlein at the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Indeed, the evolution biologist assumed long that Grönlandhaie is stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface mostly in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her time funpentuene can be, when she spent six animals in front of Svalbard out with a broadcaster.</seg>
<seg id="18">This sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed the jaw bones of a young polar bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-eres and seek Cadaver, which from higher water layers downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Grönlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch of the North Atlantic ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 inches long, during the greatest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method the lens of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the lens is already developed before the birth of the sharks, which are not renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a bit of carbon-14 in the lens.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore, therefore, after the early 1960s, when Atom waffs try to hold larger amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In contrast to 220 centimeters of length, the lens, however, contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons, so it is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the bigger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14 amounts in its lens, that is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-watch for a 493 cm long Greenland-clock has been an age of 335 years, while the record shark should be even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Grönlandhai-females then had offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined by 156 years, Grönlandhaie has become evident at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme mainly live in icy waters, is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon on the neck a 120 year old harpoon pointed, was caught up on Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on the flaming torch.</seg>
<seg id="36">So you mature later - and alps slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal covers heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram Mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives so dangerous and should focus on it as many offspring as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolution of evolution." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and the Internet in Zeitlupe: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator joined the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">Today, the successor dominates the world - its manufacturer had a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite knocking.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the beginning, the built-in memory was eight Megabytes, which would be rich in high resolution today.</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now shipping with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" was exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, into the shops - and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros lovers can buy the devices on the Internet, but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.</seg>
<seg id="11">However, 20 years ago the Communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Cebit's computer fair in Hanover, as an "office in Westeraschenformat."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax it was the Communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to websites was possible via HTML-browser, even though torso slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A pocket calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be flipped like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud of the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could guess in August 1996 that Communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, although not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The cell phone number of Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster. finally, it was sold and handled at Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">The market dominates the market today, which came all a lot later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">Being online and everywhere, this is today for a lot of people everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="26">In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="27">Sold around 1.4 billion devices, Samsung and Apple accounts for about 555 million of them alone.</seg>
<seg id="28">Global sales with equipment is around 400 billion euros.</seg>
<seg id="29">The well-running business of countless App-providers and the telecommunications concert will come along.</seg>
<seg id="30">Around the smartphone has meanwhile emerged as a whole industry.</seg>
<seg id="31">The crucial breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007, then Apple boss Steve Jobs announced the implementation of the iPhones at the beginning of 2007.</seg>
<seg id="32">He promised three equipment in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator, easy to use by touch screen.</seg>
<seg id="33">The victory of the Apple began, even today, the iPhone is the most important product of the Group.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who ruled the market had seen the night.</seg>
<seg id="35">They disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.</seg>
<seg id="36">We now have Apple and Asian suppliers such as Samsung.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Smartphone is a self-understanding for 20 years after its invention.</seg>
<seg id="38">On average, every German today is looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "we all have to learn to put the smartphone even once," "" "said Janina's sphere, in the Siemens board of staff." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA Musikamodells, the Venus was likely to be habitable once.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model in order to discover the past of the Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble air research.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions with their hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously pointed out that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by her dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and still slowly revolted.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lighted the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet found probably more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to host life and protected from faster evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.</seg>

<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures that are some degree cooler than the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought out a history of Venus that resembles evolution that previously thought of Planetarium researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was presumably habitable to be habitable, the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Her oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datklau: so perfide squeezing hacker your ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of pressors currently use targeted companies - and are successful here.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey of malware-Defense-specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed firms have at least once, partly multiple victims of attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies already have the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims are willing to readily be willing to use the required soldering costs for the requested systems and data to be used again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The criminals specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes in addition to attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to eraser ransom is much higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrator discovered software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users had the aim, but the change to company attacks were scary quickly in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer's computer, it searches for targeted files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as to archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently the software presents the demands of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final code for the files, the victims must have money - mostly in the form of Cryptowing Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where in private users the personal photo database is based on the game, it works with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage fails when a ransomware fails.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent had to completely interrupt the business activity, in case of a case, people were in danger.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in Germany, several hospitals were victims of attacks whose patients may be threatened by loss of health prevention." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims," "" "does not pay, you only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies, pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the operation of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study, the security researchers of F-Secure have examined the usage areas and the contact with the blackmail and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">You explain your victims by chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, judge freely accessible support websites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private people dissolves the payments of a few hundred Euro, companies must act hard and pay five-digit sums to back their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming professional and share the job, declaring security experts Kester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">More likely, it is that it is three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of a software construction kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits created by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in delivery is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then seek more hackers to spread the freshly caught software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So, in one of the forums in the underground, the set purchases from a criminals and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per content calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually, the criminals then apply spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT responsible in the Malwarebytes survey have confidence to defend Ransomware using File Back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is no sufficient threat to successful creation, the perpetrators threaten the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," "" "explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">For instance, the potential for damages depending on the type of data is still higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators could also have completely new goals in the internet of things into the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the ground conference of defecon demonstrating security researchers as they could get a thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then put an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be subject to industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row as well as in the rear.</seg>

<seg id="10">The trunk height can be loaded well, however, the load height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide range of speed.</seg>
<seg id="12">His work is likely to do something silent.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine support: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">The equipment in the tested top-variant "Executive" has no wishes to be desired.</seg>
<seg id="19">The City emergency braking system is one of the safety systems (works to pace 32), the collision warning system and the spa coach.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warner sometimes irritates, because he discaresses many obstacles as "herannating objects."</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light is very reliable.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent tempo control is responding to the traffic sign detection and drosselt when you need the speed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, App-Integration and More.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and an HDMI connector lying under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to reach.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Who doesn't want to invest so much, will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleep disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one gets eternally awake, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning, far before the wake-up rings, do no longer think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep problems and more than ten per cent feel their sleep frequently or permanently recovered than not recovered.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the German Society for Schlaffing and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understood among them, is the insomnia, thus an insight and a sleep disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Straight through the sleep, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German House Physicians with practice in the lower Saxon Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it, organic, mental or behavioural factors can be stuck, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleep disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early wake-up is especially frequent during a depression," says Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors deliberate each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who for example has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up all two to three hours and begin to salvably on everyday problems and care to pondering, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disturbances to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well for a period of a month in at least three nights per week, should be impaired by the doctor, advises Weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: it is smitten, tired, unruined, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">To relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The options are subject to behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire.</seg>
<seg id="22">In Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, hardly emphasised in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, at bedtime, one should first turn to the physicologist, Weeß is advising.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with studies, whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">To study in the sleep laboratory, medicine, for example, for snoring with respiratory messages, in case of illness, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">We don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the wired one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes in the body, one carries a nasal goggles, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">The camera also shows a camera on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many pitch screws on which you can place for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß is up to: regular sleep and firing times, not to be long in bed, not to sleep on the day, not watch television to sleep, stop drinking alcohol and at night did not start at night - then you begin to get right away, and that is absolutely not helpful.</seg>

<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working district, which also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home networks and the native residential projects have long been part of the Kiev country: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR, including almost the entire mainboard street in the vicinity of the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "while the Mainzer had been vacated under the right side of police, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigs and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district in recent years has become increasingly difficult for tourists and voting liner from all over the world: with them now residents of GDR times and former home network share their maxim.</seg>
<seg id="21">This can also be felt with the rent, which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigs are being attacked as symbols for this development: you can recognize them on raised disks or freshly painted facades which have been subjected to cravings.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for that not all neighbors could consider it as a problem, that it is not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury, according to almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes involve tangible damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "what acts of violence is it important:" "" "the people in the 94 are their neighbours, who would not have been this." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars can no longer give it in the Rigs no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the studied architecture, its road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and receives more from each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that the local people had their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all had the interpretation of the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of habitants such as Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: by unloose new buildings in former buildings that impose the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "they are all right-condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here are more people who are not so good," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "violence and destruction can't be gutheirs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone is listening?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is a frustration at all sides, even in the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer, Kerstin Neugebauer, has little understanding: the skin projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who are moving, should be aware - just like someone who moves into a bar district, can complain badly about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with previous names have asked to be called by their right name</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partnership in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogues supports the management team at Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugees, administration, authorities and who else involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer of the working group indicates that Deuschle is now more than thankful that Deuschle now is there, the jealous wool mellow, which primarily has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">So some - less mocking than rather the multitude of desired application areas was purposeful - meant when the administration wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sought a management expert with a talent for languages and people, associated with a longstanding experience in the field of social work, a skilled wool mellow.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administration work is not its central area, Annika Deuschle means.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is an organisation to work with people on site and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has taken a 50 percent mark on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer that Annika Deuschle Honey and main actors are supported." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organisational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time, apartments for connecting refugees, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the supply of the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They need to accommodate refugees in own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes itself.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from land rats to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time than very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it doesn't work, so you should rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be replicated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">Soon new containers will be erected in the water road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the catchword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle are naturalized.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed lead, there are interns places, training places, school courts, one-euro jobs and helpful activities for refugees and migrants that have to be found or furnished.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places were good," reports Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, doing charitable work - and the motivation and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But does not just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, tell Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop an adequate feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">So special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional classes are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So it also starts administration and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are desired in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain the refugees that it lasts, and they can bridge the time meaningful, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Those who make the feeling of develop, he could not work in Urbach, do not work and be useless, I will never be incorporate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are also," "" "says customer honestly," "" "people, in which nothing goes." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this was already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do both of the latest incidents are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "no," "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "What mancher may call naive." "" "but a chance could not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are subject to the refugees too.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the attacks bring them completely in demand.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary local must look on site and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants might come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">The policy is clear to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place helpers on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"" "" "" "in Urbach we haven't arrived there where we want to go," "" "says Annika Deuschle." ""</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher also makes it possible to incorporate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they have to help them, both women are lonely.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
