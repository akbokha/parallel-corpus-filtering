Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not an am@@ us@@ ability .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with the encounter , it is also meant to go into the conflict with the Palest@@ inians and the two @-@ states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing sett@@ lements of Israel and acc@@ uses Netanyahu &apos;s in@@ def@@ icient will to the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear programme has deteri@@ or@@ ated further by the Obama administration program .
in March , Netanyahu was speaking to the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans against the US Congress a controversial speech against Obama .
the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the one @-@ time election in Israel .
in a call for a call to have shot his friend
in a call came Professor Sh@@ annon Lamb with a somewhat tender voice of the police , that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is alive and probably upset , and he said that family contact of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within the house , the officers found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ ish and a hand@@ written note that I wanted to und@@ o . I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed from Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb that made in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississi@@ ppi , had already jour@@ ne@@ yed to 300 miles to the school premises where he shot and killed another 300 miles for the police , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ bl@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police cleared him .
a day after the shooting in the university , students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what it was motivated .
the details published by the nation at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff , who knew him , spoke to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly challenging teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ onite died , he said that he has no history of violence or a criminal history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb written in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both established in the department of social sciences and history , which comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses by both .
at the same time there were some inc@@ lines to difficult behavi@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver@@ s , who blo@@ ws up Lamb , seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something is wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that lamb had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
in this year he made only two online courses .
recent changes in the University &apos;s policy of university would mean that the doctorate , for whom Lamb had worked so hard for him , would not guarantee a automatic return to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he &apos;s nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb doesn &apos;t answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs track later when he came back to Mississi@@ ppi in Arkan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner &apos;s meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb came to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people knew that they lived there .
Lamb is up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and teaching geography and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he did his doctorate in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs proclaimed him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla Mak@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met through joint friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach the guitar .
he was at the time of the women of women .
every girl named him when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Bran@@ don .
lamb and pris@@ ms were obviously together some time together .
in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no document of a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house that ven@@ ed to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were left 15 years ago but friends stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old .
&quot; it was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , he never met Lamb , but because of his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues .
lamb met Pre@@ de@@ iss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago , both appeared on a summer @-@ fair market .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light@@ lit bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he &apos;d end his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic Night in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no indication that anything was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were on the basement and sc@@ ams together .
I mean they both had a good sense for j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialised on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas so he was President of his Brotherhood and of the Student Committee .
on Tuesday evening , approximately 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , employees , students and members of the congregation took part in a cand@@ l@@ el@@ ight commem@@ orative ceremony at the Delta State Campus in Cleveland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vig@@ il vig@@ il , during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Amazing Grace &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississi@@ ppi .
associates : Emily Wagner &apos;s P@@ ett@@ us Associ@@ ated P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call , and that lamb had shot at his call , as his wife described , but there is no indication that the two got married .

Michael J. Fox sh@@ earing up his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it is slowly becoming clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary film &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I have a sim@@ ulated weight and a scar@@ let length away from Wales , to be with the princess of Wales in a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had a premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really good for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig , the biggest travel film movie ever made . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on V@@ OD , DVD and selected movie the@@ aters in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s strengthened military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons are fired by violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN Chief will again call all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution .
ban held a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet foreign minister of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the meeting of the AG@@ M in this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ ore that the insur@@ rection in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they proved on the administration of nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Re@@ question@@ able values that they show Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of the p@@ olls in p@@ olls , it hasn &apos;t worked .
ten of the last eleven national surveys conducted Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit area , and some begin to ear@@ nest out what is meant for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate business .
of course , it is too early in the electoral period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the rep@@ ubli@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ize that at that time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s guidance on the Asc@@ ent Herman Cain was launched , not one of which won only a state in the nomin@@ ee process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ ump in he@@ aps and start to get their dollar flow to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some current qu@@ eries that indicate that the real estate business is not just a temporary stage :
Tr@@ ump Ac@@ com@@ ics levels have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump gave his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans have seen the real estate business .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of them say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep in the early States .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has found that 60 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voting GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they would be either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two of 10 , they would be angry if he would be the candidate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same over Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 % of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be .
a majority of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans cannot be seen as a deal of Tr@@ ump Temper@@ ature .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is being critic@@ ized for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters say that the Real Estate Mog@@ ul said the right tem@@ per for a President , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first selection of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament did not take into the White House , just ABC / post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ars , rep@@ ubli@@ can voters keep h@@ ump for real .
if they are asked who wins the most likely the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CNN / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four out of ten of July earned their money to Je@@ b Bush .
full Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters had not seen the crystal clear crystal in the past .
at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans was that Rick Per@@ ry would win nom@@ ination compared to 28 % for the final aspir@@ ation of Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P voters will show their campaign being plau@@ sible .
even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump proposes un@@ just about everyone .
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field probably contributes to the lead , while the anti @-@ dump support is diff@@ use more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other rep@@ ubli@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump deals with majority support .
he has 14 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul Christ@@ ie 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur at 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a large majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half the voters support the ump , say that they have set up their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change your opinion .
46 percent said they left the door open to change other candidates .
yet Tr@@ ump is the strongest competition in the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters say that they have formed their minds , twice as frequently as tr@@ ump .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his campaign was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rape &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , the emig@@ ration of revol@@ ves and fishing point in public dis@@ course was about 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic exp@@ ul@@ sion by Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial H@@ isp@@ ano @-@ Americans will be away from the Republi@@ can Party and is dam@@ aging the re@@ orient@@ ated efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on issues of immigration .
so long as the immigration in the spotlight remains , it will also do Donald Tr@@ ump .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s upon new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son falls around half of the support of rep@@ ubli@@ can voters , especially through its out@@ sider status .
six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are li@@ vid to Washington as well .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent &quot; arti@@ ll@@ able . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential articles in Germany
here in the hob@@ by@@ ken@@ weg is located in the most expensive residential community - with a view over the North Sea .
on the street , one square meter roof room costs 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the supply of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular layers are one square meter most costs .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
contrary to Germany &apos;s top @-@ residence , one of the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Angel@@ s &amp; Völk@@ ers published a ranking of most exclusive German sites - with square footage in wind@@ ling heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros , per square metre .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is quite close to the point .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream begins thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two times of tor@@ ch in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller paved the way to FC Bayern 3 : 0 for Olympic Ven@@ ak@@ os Piraeus . then ran it .
a sovereig@@ n pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions @-@ League @-@ Season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won her kick play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympic ak@@ os in hot atmosphere owing to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ f@@ th series of series will be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to fet@@ ch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t in Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28 hits in the Champions League for the Bavaria @-@ Leadership Prize at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper , Roberto , who would pass through a f@@ lange shot of the world master .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised in front of the game in front of the Car@@ am@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich spoke word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea , without having to shine .
Pi@@ re@@ aus had won his most recent six home games in the p@@ inn@@ acle , among them in Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
but the Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven Europe @-@ du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went to brave , with their offen@@ sives , but often to think about plants .
the attacks were often led by a pass to the left of Douglas Costa , who has rarely crossed against the former Braunschwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller made more happiness than his f@@ lange from the right half @-@ field in the left upper right corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion delivered the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best opportunities in half .
first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Der@@ ye Brown hit the head of Poland from the line ( 26 ) .
by default , the go@@ al@@ keeper had par@@ ked Roberto with his knees ( 3@@ th ) .
although the Bavaria was domin@@ ating its usual game , Pir@@ ating was able to set a needle eye .
but Manuel Neuer was at the ke@@ epers of Manuel Neuer .
in such a way , he drew a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
prior to New , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola made a four @-@ bay centre with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat at first outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero gave only the green light after the final training , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who wants to make something different from it is v@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the chi@@ pped Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made another one .
before the game , it was hit in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ alle .
after a smaller group of avoided fans of Bavaria fans in their audience block apparently gave the followers of hosts Pir@@ ae@@ us with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went with sticks against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured during the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
the one who smo@@ kes is not only har@@ med by the lungs , but also the teeth of a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : this reduces the risk .
smo@@ kers have a considerably increased risk of losing their teeth in early .
this goes from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among which several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smoking allo@@ ys the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly , around 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 feet was higher .
scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
main causes for dental fail@@ ures are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ize the authors .
the relationship between smoking and dental loss therefore goes back to frequent gum disease in smo@@ kers .
not sufficiently , smoking is also increasing the risk for c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who heard with smoking could reduce their risk within short time , writing the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it could take over ten years , until the end@@ an@@ gering is back to the level of non @-@ smoking , declared First author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
one can convince people of being non @-@ smoking , study leaders H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge as well as a good health health to high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population are affected by in@@ som@@ nia in the age of 65 to 74 years , shared the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous exam@@ inations have already been informed that smoking is the risk for early loss of teeth .
the new long @-@ term study mo@@ red the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne at the late ancient

the museum has always been appointed as a specialist for Archae@@ ological ground floor in all building projects in Cologne .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the arch@@ e@@ ologists were found here .
of text documents had already been known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church has been standing , explained Trier .
beside the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with some 350 graves have been discovered which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over TTIP
the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system for the development of the Stre@@ its via the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private external safety devices between corpor@@ ations and states are therefore to be replaced by a transparent system which clearly represents more traditional courts in its function . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to trust the citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before , the Swe@@ de had to put the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
the TTIP must be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform current sl@@ ate proceedings regarding the EU states and the US will select independent judges for a new investment Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US , and third countries .
the second instance is also planned for the first time .
it would allow it to lev@@ y against jud@@ gements .
so far the rules set up mut@@ ually at arbit@@ rator , a claim against their jud@@ gements did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice were un@@ familiar , commented at Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;

del@@ icacy Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on the stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to it is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the Fol@@ der @-@ acting follow@@ er has recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is nearly grab@@ bed by Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he talks on the basis of various places that he repeatedly records on the map , tell about his min@@ u@@ ously and delic@@ ately prepared songs .
where they arose and how it looks like , in his homeland .
since then Stev@@ ens has been making mira@@ cul@@ arly cre@@ ativ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Great Lake State &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; impres@@ sively composed songs that beat harmon@@ ically very closely to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can at any time dri@@ fted into great op@@ ul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it arises the rum@@ our that &quot; Michigan &quot; would be the first part of a twi@@ sted series : each of the 50 states of states must be followed in succession .
but already in 2004 and in Rhin@@ eland , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; already appeared and positively expectations .

after re@@ productive experiments , Stev@@ ens is served as &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic copies .
this sixth regular studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but supported by programming sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with all effect and rever@@ b .
already after the smaller club , the stage shows will be featured here for the colorful spectac@@ le of ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and a great fluores@@ cent stage de@@ ko .

without direct a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is played through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can punch the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s debut for the prime minister of the Prime Minister , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns is eag@@ erly a@@ waited .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n wants his debut with Prime Minister at the Prime Minister for the first time to start David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is going to rise to the first of his six questions shortly after lunch , and his performance from the media is prob@@ able and the Labour M@@ EPs from near .
he requested &quot; less theat@@ res and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip a few sessions around them to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes to a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let Chamber after his appointment at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration of the overthrow of the National An@@ them , the decision of the National An@@ them on Tuesday prov@@ oked a commem@@ orative ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS will be prov@@ oked by a number of cover stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; respec@@ t@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ent@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two news@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of their faith that the monarchy should be abolished .
almost a dozen of the shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are calling on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences could follow within &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on Mr Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the Bo@@ unds for th@@ read@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , the TU@@ C conference , fore@@ told the Labour Party to remove all the idea of a limitation overall .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pension ministers , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he has been T@@ ory chief , in the last decade , over the D@@ isp@@ atch Box in parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Labour Supreme Leader &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; promised a different polit@@ ician , says he has given a Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the members of the Prime Minister said to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impact strength &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that it is under@@ estimated both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impacts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economy minister , is represented when he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues occasionally sei@@ ze the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kas@@ el @-@ The@@ aters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is often associated with the prime minister of the Prime Minister . but some years later he was granted to have failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since it was broadcast on TV first in 1990 , the question@@ naire was considered as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the executive and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary report , although critics have argu@@ ed to become a caric@@ ature and require far reaching reforms .

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the UK
the Po@@ und jumped from data that indicates an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s target .
between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew 2.9 % compared with the same period of last year .
this percentage had been the fastest and earned assessment of interest rate since 2009 .
the pound went by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 505 and was climbed to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 million .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v entered the market .
one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands like Bud@@ wis@@ er , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were to be encouraged by the competition for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again de@@ filed growth .
shares of G@@ LEN@@ CO@@ RE increased 5 % after the mining harvest said he has taken EUR 2.5 billion by a share sales as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his own app@@ rais@@ al for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sport boo@@ sting companies reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million Euro for the half @-@ year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers can mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchase will be the higher labour costs of his company , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D sport , he added , and that could mean less additional jobs .

Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ IDA poster brings food on potato @-@ bass idea
potatoes or öner ?
it comes both - and in the potato @-@ woofer , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger ter @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Peg@@ ida movement , Al@@ hay potato and flesh put on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster on a ida demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill dip in his shop is shooting , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has meanwhile admitted Lebanese man by the Patent Office in Munich .
it has been protected by the authority since recently as a utility patent .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ e@@ wer bears , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y .
just as much : &quot; it tastes even better with it , &quot; he finds .
culinary international understanding arrive well with its customers .
met@@ cash starts Ground Clear@@ ance campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - inhal@@ ation
met@@ a is trying to protect IG@@ A branches in front of a Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers &apos; whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers &apos; cash cash has launched a soil compensation campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million US $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets remain their relationships with local food suppliers and expand the brand IG@@ A through mainst@@ ream marketing and marketing about the social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump aboard , with brands such as ice manufacturer Simm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop owners who sell exclusive tickets to the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
it is expected that some more details of his defence strategy will be published on September 29 when the whol@@ es@@ aler brings forth food , alcohol , and equipment to its annual investors strategy day .
it is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia accounting for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop @-@ shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are of a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land have more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia .
however , anal@@ ysts such as Morgan Stanley , that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening its first markets , and will be taken away from all existing actors , but mainly independent retail sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A retail@@ er could spend 360 $ million in revenue per year and in cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pre@@ diction is based on the assum@@ ption that Al@@ di opens in the next year 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and grocery store and amounts to met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixing base could cost approximately $ 13 million in cash before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares are lost in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A purchases are the most loyal .
Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales grow by 3.8 percent in 2016 , in order to drop 4.2 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , owned the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business lunch in Melbourne that is likely to disappear within a decade .
it declined to react publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has been contacted by Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ As market share has declined by 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from met@@ c@@ ash@@ s dietary and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 IG@@ A retailers , has been in 2012 by 43 percent , which reflects the operating loss of debt on sales and mar@@ gins .
the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers , however , fights and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to improve selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week in enhancing their shops through fast growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the discounts and charging programs will be un@@ awar@@ ed to Elan and hopes that major distribut@@ ors will return to profit in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is sponsored by the President of the Australian Tennis Court Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for its behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism of his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , was always called &quot; Special KS &quot; by the in@@ famous confron@@ tation of Cy@@ ril with Stan WA@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y skill game in Cincinnati soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison must be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , when Harrison proclaimed : &quot; TRU@@ W@@ R@@ IN@@ KA have had to beat Cy@@ ril and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp turned a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth during the second place in Ein@@ zel behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I want to deliver rather up is the fact that after my view , Than@@ asi was stri@@ pped a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket , but he lost because of a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player that break@@ eth a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved himself extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather prov@@ ok@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he des@@ erved a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he &apos;s working hard , he &apos;s good in form , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly did not support the decision to take Cy@@ ril for the important pre@@ decision that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long lasting part to the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we hope that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all around the contro@@ vers@@ y tour &#91; Cy@@ gios &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly .
and I believe that Nick very quickly pointed out to what people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he &apos;s trying to make him understand the consequences of his action , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergen@@ cies , closes the border , with@@ holding refugees
Hungary explains the not@@ ion and ri@@ gh@@ ed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and detained all who tried to make illegal in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ land and Serbian officials came with indig@@ nation .
people who fled from violence were ready for an unknown time in a county on the road between the two controls of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ str@@ ations went aboard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ w@@ ned over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opened up the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried against the Hungarian military police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some fell from protest gro@@ c@@ eries and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants were sent back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ ally harm .
it must be held in discussions with Brussels and other countries in the coming days , &quot; said Iv@@ ica Dac@@ ic to Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serb border ended one day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c , no common immigration policy was deb@@ ated at a str@@ it@@ ful meeting in Brussels .
but the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were taken refuge in the over@@ crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would have reached that the EU states would receive further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
on Tuesday , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demands a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
however , Hungary was not seated at an im@@ mov@@ able action from Brussels or its neighbors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Emer@@ gency Day in two southern regions suffered more powers to combat the crisis so they could block streets and accelerate asylum proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire , along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison terms were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant short@@ age for many escap@@ ees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , passed that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws , which came into force at midnight , make the crossing of the border or the dam@@ aging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us who built the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws are also given greater prison sentences for the traff@@ ick@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass protests , the Hungarian government explains the state of affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ olt@@ an Kov@@ acs re@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still agree to the use of the military , but expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press has already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on days for days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country .
they come across by dam@@ aging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of alleged off@@ ences after the new laws .
authorities are thereby to repair the fence quickly .
on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cros@@ sings with Serbia after a train wagon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary had opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push down there .
about 20 people managed to get caught , but thousands remained outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would ref@@ ine food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s tax will be hal@@ ved from the national survey by Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continued to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination on the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins on the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders will be second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , will be liable for the Presi@@ dential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the elections .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , the majority of the democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined to which candidates will support them .
but clin@@ cher &apos;s supporters are more resistant than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey Clinton had lost some of demo@@ graphic groups in a number of demo@@ graphic groups , while others were able to gain some profit .
Clinton holds a large margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projec@@ tions have been reduced .
their support for men is clearly decreased , and S@@ anders can be found here only with 5 points .
where &apos;s the benefit of democratic voters under the age of 50 , they and S@@ anders are now at the same height .
Clinton , however , has a major advantage over the older voters .
last month , Clinton was with a double @-@ digit margin ahead of the liber@@ als but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters in the nation@@ wide elections are saying that they would support rum@@ ors when they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support it with some privileges and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
they would not support six percent .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially excited by her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently not support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
while 48 percent of the elections are saying that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm , say fewer rep@@ ubli@@ can voters this over their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons Supp@@ orters are asked in an open question , why they want to be the candidate , the most common answer to that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters are also mentioned its ties with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the voters are also quoted .
as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the Presi@@ dential Office , 57 per cent of democratic voters want to see him in the race , although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked of the elections , who would be their second choice for the Party , Bi@@ den is at the helm .
of Clinton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from being different .
decides Bi@@ den not to decide for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton raises another advantage ahead of being , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race at 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure declined by 78 per cent in the last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage , who sees him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable , &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , upon the question of what is important in a candidate , Democratic voters call questions over the voters .
similarly as in the last month , there is not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for those voters in the pres@@ election .
the potential candidates , potential candidates give good results in some important characteristics of voters in their party &apos;s elections .
we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership .
among the three candidates the Bi@@ den cuts the best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the leadership .
thirty per cent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
in general , the elections see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
with all these measurements , a quarter of the democratic voters no longer have the opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s understanding of a personal e @-@ mail address and server during the term as an external minister , most of the Democratic voters are pleased with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions will not affect their opinions .
but there is a total of different history in the US public .
half of Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light , split .
most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail contro@@ vers@@ y had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of her has even deteri@@ or@@ ated .
they are mainly rep@@ ubli@@ can , more than six out of 10 , who say their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less than in May .
62 percent of voting rights do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the nation@@ alities used nation@@ ally also see tr@@ ump than not honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , received good notes at the lead .
among the six tested candidates include Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush of hon@@ esty .
a majority regards others rather than hon@@ estly , but like at Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves to a nation@@ wide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump .
Ben Car@@ son is present in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close to Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters face the voters in the new survey , and others lost dramatically .
rep@@ ubli@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot at the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son counts well in demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump under rep@@ ubli@@ can voters .
the rest of the field , except for Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio President John Kas@@ i , is sm@@ itten with Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell most deep , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Florida Governor Any@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at the third place in the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey carried out last week shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - he ends up at 19 % support in rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the most recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
with a glance at one in the last week , Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump had found some side effects for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump in question .
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign &apos;s appearance in I@@ owa .

five members of the Brotherhood accompanied by the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
almost two years after a student during a delicate ritual , a student group in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pa . , died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ ans are filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction rit@@ es in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to hospital , which has contributed to his death , the police shared .
but they said that he was bur@@ dened with his eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand , and has repeatedly been attacked , while trying to walk over a frozen field on a target .
Mr. Den@@ g finally accused head@@ aches , then he fell into un@@ conscious .
the members of the Pi @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si bro@@ therhood called not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was f@@ ain@@ ted and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so called the police .
but they had time to change his symptoms to goo@@ gling his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to catch the Council , &quot; Police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of Israel began to hide from household and for the welfare of the bro@@ therhood princip@@ ally through the Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning , on his injuries .
according to a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has been subjected to st@@ ump@@ y strength of injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student has died since 1970 in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents the D@@ eng@@ s family in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and its members must be held to account and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommends a commission because of Mor@@ des third degree for the first five members .
twenty @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with obli@@ que attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to blame the parties involved , but if there is an organization that has - officially or officially , we will also draw these to account , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bar@@ uch College has prohibited the Brotherhood , and the Muslim Brotherhood has contra@@ di@@ cted its affili@@ ation to the village group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate of interest is coming , and the cat@@ fish will get into re@@ plen@@ ishment , returns for bonds , and the economy is gli@@ ding into a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know how long this will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only small directions for the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate increased and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve by lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in the process of acting as economy and financial investments .
thus , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank therefore have stressed that investors should not focus on it when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather at the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
several variables play a role in fact .
however , at the end , market buyers could find that the whole excitement was possibly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some than one signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at the Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal high@@ s , but still at a low level , to bring to se@@ is@@ mic shock , many seem to be feared .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect .
here is a look at historical trends - how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the advance of interest rate shows can make things for a while vol@@ at@@ ile .
as soon as the increase hits , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency to di@@ li@@ fy wealth of 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps again reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank anal@@ ysts , in a recent study , what happened after interest rate threats of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest @-@ rate hike , fairly flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in the past six years , with an average margin in Nu@@ ve@@ en asset management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effect on stock ten@@ ds to occur later in the increases cycle and the margin is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but advert@@ ise enh@@ ancements they often promote .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not existed before and could accelerate the recession .
very remarkable is that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point when a rate hike of the F@@ ed will be .
according to Deutsche Bank , there was only twice the nominal GDP of 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , only few expect this will continue and expect to be expected for the third quarter based on Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest rate in such a frag@@ ile economic environment could be ris@@ ky and cast the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the market buyers have made the whole year on a rate hike of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were prepared for the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strateg@@ ist and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in that session , fut@@ ures are only a probability of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all major growth cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and in pre @-@ rec@@ essi@@ vely after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession observed in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far 74 months .
the fixed income was also vol@@ at@@ ile , because the market advert@@ ised a rate hike , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than shares if they change their strategic path .
with bonds , the returns seem to change the trend as soon as the first increase / lower@@ ing occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the Incre@@ asing cycle , the di@@ stra@@ ins immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believed that the increase in interest rates will result in a closer relationship between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a de@@ fl@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ grade bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still carefully to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Anal@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis .
interest@@ ingly , Jones says that the markets have already been adapted to F@@ ed Strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the dollar &apos;s strength and the decline in inflation , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings curve is flat , it has expanded and increases vol@@ at@@ ility - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has shar@@ pen@@ ed its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large and entire company , companies that ab@@ rupt the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit if interest rates rise and more attractive to local products . &quot; &quot; &quot;
multin@@ ational companies with high debts will become worse , because an increasing dollar changes its products on the global market and likewise the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares will tend to react very positively to three months after an initial rate of interest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s anal@@ ysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with strong balance sheet today have sur@@ passed companies with a weak balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , by an average of 5 percentage points .
companies with high capital return as well as low vol@@ at@@ ility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by aver@@ aging 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest will lose on most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure equity games , consumers will also benefit from the rising Dollar .
as@@ par@@ agus could see profits by higher earnings , even if experts are more different , how fast this will happen .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says the editor of Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the transmitter because of his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is increasingly unable to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also focused on BBC Music Awards and said that she was only The Br@@ its .
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins attacked the sending The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading Parliament and adv@@ ancing new pressure on the transmitter to do something that does not do the private con@@ sign@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the con@@ serv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ver@@ stup@@ or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguish from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; dum@@ b &quot; - but it seems to be transformed into Classic FM . &quot; he said .
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards , launched last December .
the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name .
so , if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ General Director took advantage of the dra@@ fts back and argu@@ ing that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to public music and education .
what I &apos;m learning by Radio 3 , I won &apos;t get to know about classical music anywhere else .
and there is an engagement for live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to give the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and to give new works on behalf , I &apos;m also really important to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , that tou@@ g@@ her to be worked hard to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British had been informed of classical music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production which happened during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media , and sports under fire , to enter the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ ory @-@ member Dam@@ ien Collins attacked The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for the estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and is not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insist@@ ing that BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced on special BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house barn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it starts every time a maintenance series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he ref@@ uses to exclu@@ de the order from the Voice in the future , or give money to b@@ acc@@ users for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales grew in August at the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed down the expenses in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has been drilled , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into g@@ ho@@ ist@@ les .
but experts say that there are now indications that the online sales are stag@@ nat@@ ing , after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent in comparison to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales stag@@ n@@ ate , after new numbers only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales in the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales were reinforced by three years ago as a purch@@ aser , to make purchases with her cell@@ phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that comm@@ utes itself , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is quoted as a reason for inferior sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases in this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites went off .
experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers would fight for bar@@ gains , buyers could hold out to make purchases .
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spending has been issued a little more than £ 1 online .
with some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people purchase clothes and shoes online instead of sn@@ ails in the inner cities .
Muslims are buried in Mec@@ ca by the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the remains of 29 victims are borne by Muslims in the first bur@@ ial conditions in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia presents the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group on the burden .
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed
hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 victims were carried through the streets to bury the victims , who were killed as a crane on Mek@@ ong Grand Mus@@ h@@ ee .
being filled in white , dressed largely in white , the way to con@@ front their respect , when the first of the dead took their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ ur cemetery .
the fun@@ eral proc@@ ession passed by the Holy Sites , where only days before a building crane passed through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the sliding doors .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial , when the Saudi King about the building company Bin Laden in the case of the catastrophe , which caused 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction was suspended .
the remains of 29 operators who were killed as a crane desc@@ ended by the Great Central Arm@@ ee Mek@@ ang@@ kas , was carried through the streets .
among the dead Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ash@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage as the crane desc@@ ended .
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch moved to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to go on to the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the sick than he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group is responsible for the collapse .
the English language of the news agency claims that detail , but said that the management of the business abroad must be prohibited .
in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man laughed to reveal what was caused by the fall of the crane , which crashed into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the cranes , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also denied the group because of its current security measures , and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of cranes surround the districts of Mec@@ ca , as part of the massive construction project conducted by the Bin Laden group .
the family &apos;s Bin Laden has been linked to the sovereig@@ n family of Saudi Arabia for decades .
the late leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a roy@@ alty @-@ free son , who died from the family in the 1990s .
the crash of the crane came in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy way .
officials reported that 158 guests remain in hospital .
government officials accepted that 1 million R@@ ic ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are paid to the families of the killed and the same amount is permanently injured .
other injuries receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen has passed away
British employ more and more art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified handi@@ craftsmen in Eastern Europe has sur@@ f@@ le
this leads to a comprehensive coverage of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which will aim on craftsmen .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets sales nation@@ wide close the country
from Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent in the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Britain carry out their hamm@@ ers and pain@@ t@@ brush in favor of the use of qualified East European tra@@ des@@ people who perform works in their home
if you are sk@@ ill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , these seem to be a minority in these days .
as Britain increasingly employ professionals to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ gy@@ ne chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified professionals from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , is out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops is planning to open up to craftsmen and close at 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the shop are made by women .
in the moment , men survived the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demo@@ graphic trends that have more female single @-@ households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; It is still a majority of men in our stores .
we must shift this into balance .
basically half of our clients cons@@ ulted with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a big role in the decision process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women listed by the top of a UK in FT@@ SE@@ 100 , has also surrounded her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher has reported a decline in half year earnings and sales , after the Group paid the costs for the closing of the stores .

on Wednesday , the Kl@@ agen@@ furt regional court on Wednesday have to defend two function@@ alities of Austrian volleyball @-@ Vic@@ tory A@@ ich / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of counter@@ act .
he was acquitted as a result of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the Pro@@ state At@@ tor@@ ney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants were cryst@@ all@@ ised in the years 2006 to 2011 , that the def@@ endants were allowed to disp@@ ose up in their functions for private purposes .
the damage amounts to about 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial exp@@ ires .
this fact was the President of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ats judge , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negoti@@ ated at a later time .
the Defence case was rejected by the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that no point of property has ar@@ isen after no time .
the sports officials would have b@@ illed only for allowance and the sports club , which it had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money , from the liabilities - the Pas@@ si@@ va in 2001 will have around 600@@ .000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ ,000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then we stood before the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do we keep the club further or do we lock up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the accused , in the bread @-@ firm of the Chief Financial Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shed money , our life insurance was laid down as a safety in the bank , &quot; he said in engagement .
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money , they only have to be made a debt .
moreover , in the case of appropriate financial success , the payout of allowance for allowance was decreased retro@@ actively until 1991 .
hence , one part of the allowance for damages not only years later , starting in 2003 when a plus was paid on the account , paid out .
that is why the l@@ ump and not detailed bookings appeared , explained the former chairman .
the accounts and management books administered the two def@@ endants in common , the second accused .
why the payments did not be explained in detail in detail , the judge said .
the association did not care in detail for financial clearing , it is important only to have the freedom of debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 , against whom a function@@ ary investigation began , an amount of EUR 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the Club account .
those were resi@@ due , the def@@ endants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; he wanted to know the judge .
Wher@@ eu@@ p@@ on I knew no answer .
then he said that he believed that this was the best for the association .
if something happened to him , nobody had known anything of this money , the public pro@@ secutor in the room .
the accused has been informed , ri@@ ght@@ ful and function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; pay repar@@ ation . &quot;
why does dangerous waste confirm ? , judge and public pro@@ secutor wanted to know .
he declared the first accused , he would not agree with this form@@ ulation , because the association had never caused any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; he asked .
he also said the function@@ ary that he never related a cent content , he calculated only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ ets .
on di@@ eting , he charged the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher than he added .
the def@@ endants were not available for the early years .
these are considered as correct , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer declared it declared .
the second accused also had obtained o@@ dom@@ eter .
all accommodation must be made in cash , along with that he had to drive from his home market to the Bank to Abi@@ burg , he stated in his statement .
the main proceedings will be on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hewlett @-@ Packard holds more 30,000 jobs
in addition to running current job loss for three years , the comp@@ ute terri@@ esis will build a further jobs in the division of the company .
the actu@@ ators with the Hewlett @-@ Packard ( HP ) are no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans for winding down 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate clients .
this means that the costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) and shared the company on Tuesday .
the stage will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion that will rise from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
as at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2.000 employees .
Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Share had reached 2.3 percent .
the Group from the California Palo Alto ha@@ ves itself up to date : in this way , the computer and printing business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the future rate of computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both parts are to be recorded on the stock exchange .
a dis@@ appointing PC sales as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers following his services by the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturers to be put on phone .
the sales of PC and printers had dropped by 11.@@ 5 percent in the third quarter of July .
turnover fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the revenues went back to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a break @-@ up and massive sub@@ stit@@ ch form@@ ations in the industry .
the 76 year old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only responded late to customers to buy smartphones and tablets with conventional computers instead of conventional computers and have more and more business online .
Whit@@ man restructuring plans will see the removal of approximately 5,@@ 5,000 positions in total .
conflict : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in Iraq war @-@ operations would fight mainly to re@@ jection : 54 percent said , against the contrast , 35 % were backed up .
the fact that other countries fly air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
24 percent are in contrast to interv@@ ene in the conflict .
a collaboration with Syrian power , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents would have been 20 percent .
29 percent could not decide .
car : second press date at the 6@@ 6th IAA
at the centre of the fair stand to the 27th of September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organis@@ er of the V@@ DA by car will count about 900 000 visitors just two years ago .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non@@ violence on Serbian Border
the Hungarian police had employed on the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and against several hundred re@@ pris@@ ings .
Eur@@ one@@ &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the attack on the border check@@ point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it was a police line and behind the police officers were ready .
40 to 50 refugees cr@@ ammed with stones , t@@ uns and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials rely on without inter@@ rupt@@ cy spray .
afterwards the police closed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drawn some time .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken from the zone .
children who entered the Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as , cried .
other refugees sank in themselves and suffered under respir@@ ation .
the press spokes@@ man of the Serbian police suffered injuries by deplo@@ ying Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Pe@@ per@@ mint .
time of decision on interest rates for the US not@@ ices
the world ob@@ serves when the US ambul@@ ances arrive on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision , whether for the first time since almost a decade , interest will be raised or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found out that a little more than half , the last week of the sight was that the F@@ ed will do this now , and now think that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates will keep on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it &apos;s a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates remained on NULL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may go from the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ de , senior assistant at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , tr@@ illion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to set up an increase , but signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
death certificate at Delta State University , left debt writing
after shooting and killing his friend in Mississi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on Monday morning - wrote Sh@@ annon Lamb a note to say that he wanted to make it happen , &quot; he couldn &apos;t make it happen , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer in geography and social education at Delta State University , calling for emergency number 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he had shot on someone and killed them .
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency center , that polic@@ emen will send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am poured out my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house except &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb has no explanation for his feet .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to und@@ o it .
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he eventually took his own life on Monday night when polic@@ emen rang him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he &apos;s nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb thought that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , comments on Tuesday , there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ ent@@ zen was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she was married for about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground .
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ ina was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
pom@@ eg@@ ade worked online from home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les that was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss .
Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who had a dog called Light@@ ning , met lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lamb called me relative at a certain time on Monday to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was not in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when police found him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb got a doctorate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as his lo@@ lau can be found on the university &apos;s website .
stars that lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some st@@ ress@@ ful years .
in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ term partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , due to cancer .
the actor allegedly strug@@ gled with drugs , and in 2008 he was convicted of drug makers .
all this certainly calls his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of group sales .
in the year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros in a better organization .
the Group &apos;s group sales will cost around 150 of the 1000 exec@@ u@@ tives worldwide .
with the pilot of the pilot , there &apos;s new negotiations .
the Lufthansa builds up its company structure and evalu@@ ates the cheap Euro@@ wings budget .
the Bank &apos;s goal of re@@ orientation of about 500 million Euros per year from cost and revenue sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline issued on Wednesday .
among other things , there will be no executive board for passenger rights in future .
the Euro@@ wings budget line should be developed as unique as possible .
CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future , by CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr .
the head@@ lining showed the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in future .
so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex .
the airlines operated under the air@@ field of the Air@@ line Group , which produces three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new talks with the pilots
the proceedings are due to be resumed on this Thursday in the proceedings of the pilot &apos;s cockpit ( VC ) .
this shared the union with .
the subject of talks will be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was able to achieve sustainable results in a year with a previously predicted record result . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between trade union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
in addition to the trans@@ itional supply of pilots the &quot; Wings &quot; concept is next to the trans@@ itional provision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sees that Lufthansa in the fight against competitors fought against the Group &apos;s own budget line Euro@@ wings . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Manchester United Kingdom of Manchester United can &apos;t play for a double fre@@ y
in the Champions @-@ League @-@ defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w was a double fre@@ igh@@ ting of his right B@@ one at PS@@ V Eindhoven .
while this is the left external defending for wines and received it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the violation was created by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s got a double cri@@ b y and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps one day later and in Manchester operated .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United to play it very hard , and then it worked fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room , it had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , the six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and hanging a mis@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the arbit@@ rator , did not pun@@ ish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian arbit@@ rator had s@@ cour@@ ged .
you can judge for yourself , if I say that a native of el@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very worse attack with two legs .
a twe@@ et for Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I will be stronger again . &quot;
concerning this : Manchester United suff@@ ers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat at PS@@ V
the England advoc@@ ate has an additional inc@@ en@@ tive in France with the European Championship in France up to the next June .
Phillip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury to the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to harm an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a demol@@ ition when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me , it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball who was travelling in a different direction so that it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a fre@@ oul@@ t of Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost without heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he asked of a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked to call himself the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 as an environmental fa@@ bel of Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , for it seems always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , again added a p@@ sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis of the movie version of 2012 , added to the new characters and details to extend the pretty short text text .
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ank@@ @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , it is hoped for a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y , to see her desire to see a real tree , whose name Theodor Se@@ uss ho@@ els was ho@@ stage , and the 1991 died , completely unknown .
as if this were not susp@@ ect enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air a commodity is , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he has to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron loses the action of the book so little . here an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the protests of the named Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , car@@ ving , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who has not read the Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably supported by Cameron Elec@@ toral Office .
however , Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult .
to come to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one has selected the qu@@ ay , the UK for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series will not be on my card .
I would not exclu@@ de a spro@@ cket one .
Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ling list , and the common spirit is strong ; they will no scars result in 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as a spin Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack .
this is related to this : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England test cad@@ res and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th out is natural for me as his head coach in Yorkshire , hard to analyze .
with its seven tests there were two good attacks on difficult conditions , and simple but hard reality is that mystery players are oriented on results .
there was no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this - players are choosing their own best selection .
a long time ago , we had been extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
when he hits you another trend in Yorkshire , another chance will come .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss comm@@ ended his post@@ ure , even if he did not get so good performance , and that surprises me not ; he is primarily a team man .
the question , how much time a test punch man receives to place his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton has nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and upwards .
the only accus@@ ation that you could rise was that England first hit Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but that lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a drummer , which I admired highly .
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yorkshire early in this season when he made 236 with us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which made us a lot .
he must pay at least the same odds as those in front of him , but this course depends on the team effort in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of bringing Mo@@ een along with Cook , which gives an extra spin Bow@@ ler and gave up four j@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing about it .
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man cannot hit there , and this lef@@ th@@ band has already shown that it is a devil &apos;s cri@@ cket player .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s no number 3 for them , and there is no difference there .
my former team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he re@@ signed as open@@ er in 2001 .
he made three hundred ra@@ ges immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
T@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as Back @-@ up @-@ Sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may look at his st@@ ats - average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup tra@@ ders who lift their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made a few smart additions at the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master@@ coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game that will bring an abundance of experience since it has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes with the white sphere @-@ stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the International Cri@@ cket Contest , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes , new voices can bring fresh wind in the changing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously predicted .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that .
some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team job do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit UK from the EU ) could gain from Zul@@ u if the economy starts into a Fl@@ au@@ te by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s in@@ negoti@@ ated new strategy to keep UK in the EU will be at trouble with every day , even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n for the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who fought severe due to Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at friend said so , that some member states are ent@@ an@@ gled in a variety of crises such as the EU is now and not ever since their own fault , Britain &apos;s herself created agenda with split conditions and distur@@ bing the changes you don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting , that it may not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection .
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance will climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , making a photo of yourself in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants to see the Great Britain under the outside of the EU - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not be alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and lets us know that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials came in some capit@@ als to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for them as it does in the ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated long spread like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a aband@@ on@@ ment force .
Poland will soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain an left one .
it is difficult to imagine that they are going to become a leg to help the sel@@ f@@ ie British , to prevent the sel@@ f@@ ie British , to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because the most similar separ@@ at@@ ist ten@@ dencies have .
hence some such Ministers may even include deliber@@ ately non @-@ helpful remarks , especially in SN@@ P @-@ style , while the UK &apos;s referendum accelerate in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my boyfriend is assumed .
&quot; the new trial was a ple@@ ad &quot; and &quot; Britain has gained nothing from the new store . &quot;
Europeans know how blu@@ ish the Fle@@ et Street to its cost and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons , as it did not have been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s inspiring refer@@ end@@ ums in 1975 , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they may well remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who formed a name for itself as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for all his consider@@ ations , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
for this purpose , the Med@@ ley was assigned by tax ev@@ ading barrier , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ers and p@@ seudo @-@ In@@ lands that have most of our big newspapers .
actually , Tony Bl@@ air thought about it , but noted that when you sit with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage that is better distributed to di@@ stract him , instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band had opposed the Bl@@ air himself as Bl@@ air himself when he opposed the constitution of the referendum , which was turned down by French and Dutch voters in the year 2005 , which thus opened a back@@ door to him .
the press never has forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on the back in the Monday of Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t seem to mention a time more for me in danger of Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 &apos;s years , a mistake back then and today .
it may take out but it must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s official position to Europe - I &apos;m friendly - I &apos;m friendly - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ ef@@ ar@@ b@@ bon tendency and the wild gra@@ ins of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ ke &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell was a rather bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it re@@ minded me of the 70 &apos;s , when his old father strug@@ gled up on TV against his Labour @-@ Kabin@@ ett@@ sk@@ ol@@ lie , without going too far and lose his Cab@@ inet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was still more attractive .
but to fight , &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell told us what J@@ C told his clas@@ h@@ ers and MPs after all reports on their shut@@ down on Monday evening .
whatever the touching picture of the bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - please remember that he even touched me - News discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all things in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe that allows him to maintain lab@@ ours in the refer@@ end@@ ums , such as Mc@@ Don@@ nell &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns Basic multi @-@ powers to EU membership - in harmony with her Benn@@ ite Belgian @-@ economic crisis - is no longer just a question of the es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ si@@ dents , for which the nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central base of dog@@ matic dispute .
as with its mult@@ it@@ eful to Nato - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - are foreign diplom@@ ats going to try to find in everything a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin w@@ asted political capital - they also have suspic@@ ious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if this may be po@@ int@@ less ?
the U.S. are already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , when starting on Monday , I was re@@ minded of what British Influ@@ ence Security Forum had been re@@ minded .
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the claims of a state financed agency that E @-@ cigarettes have been less harmful than smoking began in a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , initiated by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in its report on e @-@ cigarettes used evidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fund@@ amental Not@@ ification &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the pay@@ load of the data and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily tiny foundation &quot; on which P@@ he established his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two further researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene , and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the efficacy of effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public is expected that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of the follow @-@ up and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to implement a model for a multi @-@ sector decision analysis ( M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to conduct their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously obtained from British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T Public Health in a Sustainable Development Report , said them .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to obtain funding from a e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer but not the funding that he should have received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International in order to add it .
the reasons for the selection of the board members are not supplied , but there are several known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also indicate a wide range of industries in the paper .
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the session .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research group of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ oning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far no evidence shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is so far no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes had been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted .
he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low , but that we continue to study the long term effects .
P@@ he has the clear duty to publish the public via what gives proof and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative dangers as compared to tobacco .
almost 80.000 people annually die in a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs two billion £ each year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the clear provision of current evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC should quit the East@@ man , says former head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that BBC should stop programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arms &apos; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs which are not sent by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ized the BBC for it publicly that they are likely to be public @-@ legal programs , probably disp@@ uted from a smaller audience , to the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and sen@@ ators like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to get into contact with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes would be on behalf , or sending us that were clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson reported to the Ober@@ haus communication committee as part of his investigation into the future of BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the radio charge , what I do not mean to have a good idea , at least , its production should at least be on programs , which do not make or put forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time@@ frame , because they want to achieve optimum support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea that nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course it is non@@ sense .
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs are financed which could be funded without subsi@@ dies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for that .
I am trying to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I do not think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s debt on the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of men who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular Shows of the BBC will be back again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , placed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart @-@ lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows as a East@@ man should sell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal N@@ ic programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they can argue they have their jobs , and they can argue they have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they put them in a time@@ frame , in which no one wanted to see her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , think everyone &apos;s thinking that you receive a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for the 150 £ each year , ask me whether this is correct , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ lan@@ e- and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , urged the BBC to check out their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to inform and talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , only little from the BBC &apos;s production would be officially classified as education . he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % in the radio - and it should be an example of the public @-@ legal television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown , and with the commercial sen@@ ators Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with tim@@ impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with gene@@ tically modified N@@ erv@@ ular systems , controlled by fl@@ aps of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are at the moment they are with sound impul@@ ses that are to be heard for the human ear to be em@@ ir@@ radi@@ ated .
the impul@@ ses are working through power @-@ on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are gene@@ tically modified to carry the membrane channels that react on ultrasound sensors .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method , called son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics when ultrasound used to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain brain stimulation , an invasive procedures which gives an electrical impul@@ ses to the treatment of symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease .
don@@ ors normally do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani agreed that they did so if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scop@@ ic air bubbles .
the bli@@ sters , found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ asonic waves , which then penet@@ rate into the worms .
the ultr@@ asonic waves impact on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and found in the membran@@ es of some of the worms .
the sound waves result in the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells associated with them , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ ds , Chal@@ as@@ ani modi@@ fies the worms that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ists carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he takes an ultrasound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and place in the worms , where they turn the changed motor @-@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with Op@@ to@@ v@@ ol , a ground@@ breaking tool that allows researchers to inter@@ fere and switch neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to come down on an optical fiber to the required position in the brain , low frequency @-@ ultr@@ asonic waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent up in the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical approach to certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ de@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for life in student homes
eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ality Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the cl@@ amped smile of those who I have been angry - and to the numerous , leng@@ thy problems about others .
most of what I have learned , can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the ho@@ ist in student residence is ranging from light @-@ winding up to an absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to write : people tell you where and where you have taken the Sabbath year , and why you have taken us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly Mar@@ m@@ ite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in ear@@ nest , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe in through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it controls the talk and helps you find out men who like you like in contrast to those you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were in fire and these fire ext@@ ingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave people .
the rooms of people are often transformed into drinks , film @-@ night venues and commun@@ al hits , but they are also the places where people put on and their under@@ wear .
terms of this : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a rough handling at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student dormitories form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ be@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this may be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like you and I want our friendship going on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back I &apos;ve consumed for the interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ mil@@ it@@ one is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send it a text instead of kno@@ cking .
ap@@ rop@@ os kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormitories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship fixed through baking .
as you start the university on the climax of Back Man@@ ie , the clo@@ cking at the doors of men , to present themselves with a plate of brow@@ nies , is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have some baked some stuff . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats to offer is a good way to close friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel comm@@ ited to enter@@ tain yourself and will be associated with a delicious surprise at the end .
of course , this depends on whether you are a constant b@@ aker .
po@@ or@@ ly mixed sm@@ ashing of flour , sugar and fat make people dor@@ man@@ t when you knock .
to steal food , is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a rob@@ ber@@ y , but is it take a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check it with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to control themselves , even when they cook inside .
when someone ste@@ als your stuff , that is annoying , and you have my emp@@ athy - but try to learn that balanced as my ro@@ omm@@ ate , who added a rinse agent to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise , which holds people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being an decent person , but that you belong to humans in the true sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b who are sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , if there is something to tell them , Drum &amp; Bass a little qui@@ eter because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an examination in the morning .
they responded to more loud music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbor to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut down their door and ended up to her dre@@ ad@@ ful examination .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would go into the same student residence ?
in other words , it would not be ab@@ om@@ in@@ ely embar@@ rass@@ ed when you take a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future spouse stay , will make them go again and will see them every day , and maybe join them out how they over@@ ride any common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future spouse , try to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en for a little reason .
in the exciting moment , in which you notice that someone has to lie his keys in his not closed rooms is the border between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing f@@ one , than it seems .
a good trick is funny , but it takes only moments until he is going to stroll .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t che@@ w someone &apos;s rooms with tooth@@ paste and sh@@ ampoo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer , but do not cra@@ ck@@ le its poss@@ essions on the ceiling no more than twice .
ter@@ raced houses for refugees , single @-@ parent val@@ et services
the real estate contrac@@ tor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds on Central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ h@@ ul@@ ter@@ raced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a co@@ hab@@ itable room but also the mother and the Ger@@ ing @-@ serving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I will show you how to build fast and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview .
thousands of refugees are displac@@ ed to housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how much cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project ter@@ raced houses for refugees .
Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees are pushing for housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain in a large part here .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need enough housing in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , dre@@ ad@@ ful ter@@ raced house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a ter@@ raced house needs the least space .
it facil@@ itates integration .
this is different when people dive in blocks of living blocks .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
every living unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees say , it is peace again , I go back .
then houses can easily be converted to their respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
that is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction took six months .
this is reasonable .
did building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
ild@@ hood : I have successfully passed my project correctly .
especially complicated makes it always the imp@@ ending Dam@@ oc@@ cl@@ es@@ che@@ a special construction and the adjusting ranking .
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
it is still under@@ rated who creates three apartments in a ter@@ raced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did residents react to their ter@@ raced house project ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely isn &apos;t correct .
but do not swal@@ low your competitors for affordable apartments ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : it &apos;s true : we have had a boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need housing .
not only refugees , but also the mother or the Ger@@ ing @-@ serving .
I will show you how to build fast and good today .
that is why it goes .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the telephone gives you the option to download and then install it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some are based on problems , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
this may possibly mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this by adjusting the updates if you use a special tool to put apps and then re @-@ install apps as soon as the process is complete .
it is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located close to a charging device , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not let that the update is continued , since the phone may be switched on half way and it may lead to a termination of the updates .

whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore , is still un@@ clear .
for days , a dark bell hung over the city , triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra .

Dr. Frank Müller takes on the practice Fel@@ ic@@ ints and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ic@@ ints .
also Sam@@ t@@ bauer &apos;s mayor , Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwart@@ z and As@@ endor@@ fs ordered Mr. Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places where doctors are missing - As@@ endorf said to the other hand : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice last October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ic@@ ints goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing on his successor in the coming months with half a position .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the practice again on October 12 , till then he invested 3@@ 10000 Euro to the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy for the first sight when the field was to know Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who is currently taking part in the hospital and will also come into practice .
&quot; we always had the mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ic@@ ints and laughing .
&quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea to operate their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact to the patient are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also see his own boss .
and so you agree , the m@@ iller bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ ausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there , two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up , and his medical studies in Hanover follow the stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ ch@@ â@@ tel , and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , in 2009 he was appointed Chief Financial Officer in Die@@ ph@@ olz in 2009 and is committed to volunteer in the DR@@ K @-@ will@@ ingness @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ici@@ ausen has worked as a house@@ man , his wife is specialized in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a household in@@ arians .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the conversion , the rooms are to look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examination as well as long @-@ term and power EK@@ GS and need a speech room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the iller carrier ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) as well as from the municipality of the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality will receive a surplus of 500@@ 00 Euro ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are that practice continues to continue , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ ach@@ de@@ citizenship Bernd Bor@@ mann .
according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll about 2,000 patients come to practice Fel@@ ic@@ ausen in the North German average practice every quarter of about 500 patients .
in As@@ endorf there is another home practice .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains at As@@ endorf , according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ lows in As@@ endorf .
if no successor has found , it would have gone too .
those who want to attend Müll@@ ers are also still looking forward to familiar faces : over the seven medical experts and the cleaning of the field are taking over .
during their departure in As@@ endorf an era , the medical doctors have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminds UR@@ SE@@ L rock breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the long time , a little gent@@ l@@ eness has happened .
&quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients for sure many times , &quot; said the princess .
her husband comple@@ ments : &quot; we have a 6000 square metre property . &quot;
&quot; until now , I have always pushed myself to gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
moreover , the pair has two grand@@ sons and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are high on our border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remained parallel to this level .
however , it is clear that everyone who wants to ask for a seek@@ er of application is , of course , &quot; of course . &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , also not on the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled process .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
the Croatian government had told earlier , Slovenia and Germany also wanted to pass on refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hall@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already strong in control of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians would not want to abri@@ dging its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government fled , the first refugees have already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass in eastern Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police was able to attack them in the near cor@@ n@@ areas .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik ever joined forces with new refugees constantly in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly aimed at Syri@@ ans and Afghan women , including numerous women and children .
the Red Cross has also been used in action .
in the coming days , his country with about 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo were brought to the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ on@@ ically @-@ Serb border , which previously had brought to the Hungarian border to Croatia , and reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government insist@@ ed that it should suggest people in order to suggest certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports that in the morning a first bus with around 50 refugees arrive in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , during the day further buses were expected .
via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were traveling the whole night from the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia around 500 kilometers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made us , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this now we could actually see the postpon@@ ement of the recent Balkan @-@ Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west distance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive options to border control &quot;
Croatian Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country for the fall of a strong audience of refugees have prepared such plans for possible combinations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t name it , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive options to border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are guiding rig@@ orous controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then , the EU partners present a good testimony , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian site there were about 300 refugees arrested behind the Hungarian border .
according to Belgian media reports , they would have spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cros@@ sings hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
the Serbian Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm Wednesday early in a local presence in hor@@ gos : he held the debates about Alternative routes from refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature death .
it would not currently act for very high refugee numbers .
they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to refugees , where alternative routes are included in Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not un@@ dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still not even 20 years after the end of Croatia .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance was sent in the border region .
stock h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Su@@ p@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crimin@@ als , which has been thrown into an un@@ published financial reports and press releases on sites like Business Wire , Market@@ - and PR News@@ wire .
in@@ sider shops should have been put on the financial markets with the captured information .
they were estimated to be a total of 100 million dollars in total .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are finally caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 others accused in the case of continued acceptance .
most of the def@@ endants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe .

&quot; &quot; &quot; pul@@ s@@ ating , pri@@ estly life in the autumn sun light and in the middle four large tables each with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die &quot; &quot; &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ itals made attention to its 20th anniversary with this action and looks quite confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer .
the prime minister of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ aid is available to the pass@@ ers as well as questions and talks as the volunteers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while some travel spont@@ ane@@ ously to the cra@@ yon and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue the war &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war will stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not long suffer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say pro@@ positions as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then go further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again , at the br@@ ink of small discussions on the action , life over life , dealing with death .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only if I make sure that for me , the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice .
therefore this public relation to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
that not everyone wants to publicly express itself on the tablets , it is understand@@ able , finally it is a very personal thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of death and dying was characterized as before using tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the Hospit@@ ality Movement in recent years have helped a lot to open the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an assessment made by Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id .
the death and fun@@ eral companion belongs to the volunteers of the first hour .
accompanied by personal experience with the issue , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage themselves in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic Hospit@@ ality was searching for a volunteer , she immediately announced and was there at the foundation in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z St. Vincent .
they are all trained to be carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ro@@ id can work well with her task and experience the experiences and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life of another warnings , it &apos;s precious and about the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the out@@ patient offering of ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ ital@@ dienst is free and non @-@ free medical care .
the financial support of the health insurance and donations of families and associations enables training as well as training and moder@@ ation of the death and fun@@ eral service .
all two years trainings are offered training for new employees .
the panels described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result bl@@ ended , financial prospects for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer Gig@@ ant lowered his prize for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight service and higher costs .
the company also said that it is planning to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for vacation today .
at that time in the past year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period .
the stock was dropped by 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market @-@ commerce 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a prize between 10.1 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in financial year , which ends in the next month , 20 cents less than in previous forecast .
anal anal@@ ysts expected in a survey of fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 .
the lower price increases in spite of the price increases , which are average of 4.@@ 9 per cent and will be effective on January 4th and despite the increased attacks on ground @-@ ground imports of heavy and large par@@ c@@ els , which will be collected from November .
the company said it will nonetheless expect the earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher recei@@ pts and for growth in online retail .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company has &quot; soli@@ di@@ fied income if one considers the weaker economic terms , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced one day later as the rival UPS , that plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share came to € 2.@@ 42 per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research in@@ quired anal@@ ysts predicted .
sales rose 5 percent to 12.2 billion $ .
six out of Z@@ acks asked anal@@ ysts expected to be 12,@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline in international priority shipment , which has stag@@ n@@ ated in its unity express mail .
but the boom in online shopping has been increasing the results via F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell for higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares stood up by 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , in 15@@ 0.15 $ .
they closed on Tuesday with 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on the most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ og@@ any table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to raise the Leit@@ z@@ ins .

the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has two double order from the Congress : to keep maxim@@ ize US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed guides have recognised that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be forced by the un@@ preced@@ ented inc@@ en@@ tive by the close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the youngest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make up the careful F@@ ed representatives to strengthen its vol@@ at@@ ility by the raising of the Zin@@ c for federal bonds - and be it only by one @-@ quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they are observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , to increase interest rate , increased un@@ certainty is enough to wait around the global market enough to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no con@@ sensus regarding what the F@@ ed will do what is confused by itself to the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate rise this week .
however , the financial markets are expecting an increase in the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ k@@ ator , which shows only a 30 % chance of up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this indicates a drop in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed raises the set unless the Str@@ ate@@ urs mit@@ ig@@ ates the s@@ lap while they promise that another increase is far away .
in Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average score of 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % at 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so she could not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts claimed that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would act un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on good paths to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow merger of mon@@ et@@ ches , which would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition was waiting .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and in the proximity of the level , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was steadily under the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of last month , after China had dev@@ alu@@ ed its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial Average score fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would thr@@ ill the global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat in this month , and Dow Jones is now around 10 % below the top of May .
for the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , the market turbul@@ ences affect complex calculation , when you increase interest rates .
&quot; if events were not performed on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would be able to attract the re@@ ins in this session , &quot; said Mr D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. state treas@@ ury .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the impact on U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data to describe the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said .
the global economy is none of the major demands , so they should not be included in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency agency has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could close its mon@@ et@@ ous expansion &quot; notably , unle@@ ashed con@@ fu@@ sions around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly a@@ waiting , by F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives , they can not only monitor the developments at other locations , but also discuss in other central banks and experts , to achieve a better understanding for global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zach@@ ary Karab@@ ell , leader of the global strategy for the management of company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeffrey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ actions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic foundations . &quot;
in 1998 / 1999 , he was a member of the Federal Open Market Committee that inser@@ ts itself for a rate of interest , cited in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce their Leit@@ z@@ ins by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited apparent impact on growth in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Repres@@ ent@@ atives discussed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability during a serious crisis as the first position in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England .
the youngest turbul@@ ence do not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation , because they &apos;re afraid of a interest rate because the markets were more exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act contains still the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I don &apos;t think they should pre@@ suppose time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small living help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany in these days .
to prepare a warm welcome , not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there is a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a body and soul teacher .
she is also always fond of her 74 lum@@ ber .
it does every Thursday in the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Street .
it helps immigrants from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language .
of course , the very different class of lessons are at a proper school .
Brazilian pe@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande encourages food for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pap@@ di@@ at@@ ric organisation SP@@ RS is trying to clari@@ fy women on sho@@ cking how important good nutrition during the nursing season is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted on breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , the babies do all the nutrients you need to have a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers get caught , increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ abe@@ tic fit that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women indeed affects the genes of their babies and protects them before developing tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child may neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the Bern@@ ad@@ joining municipal council approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros of expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can become a flat for solar sh@@ akers .
the planning for long @-@ sigh@@ ted gy@@ ms by step forward by step forward : in the recent municipal council session the revised building contract was blessed without great discussions .
prior to that , the Panel had also adopted an application for a structural &quot; liberation &quot; liberation &quot; from the valid earthquake plan .
the &quot; exception &quot; was the permit for a special form regarding the roof construction .
on the basis of this a &quot; se@@ at@@ plane with non @-@ current first and roof@@ top super@@ structure should be erected . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby we get a wonderfully large south @-@ roof together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again went to the roof inc@@ line that is designed for energetic reasons - differently than in the earthquake plan - should be 10 degrees below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will significantly reduce the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the roof is no &quot; exceptions &quot; - the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal law is usually restri@@ ctive with regard to freedom of liberation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when designing the gym is no recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create the preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ ast construction at the Sports Centre is a community project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsi@@ dies are expected from school and basis transport .
in the next step of proce@@ eding , the construction proposal for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now submitted to the Council .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move by P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans for the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Land@@ scape Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the Supervisory Board , however , will decide on this decision on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not travel to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered at a place in W@@ eil@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
the staff were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the altern@@ ation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now changing to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to the question of who the successor is to play , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who was willing to take over leadership and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au from 1 October onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dev@@ alu@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a bro@@ ader of the offer in the field &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot;
fishermen is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in interior and gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years a fisher@@ man with his team , when the Supervisory Board is agre@@ eing to both houses , until the next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ berg , which still has over 35 beds , has to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the county has planned this for 2018 when the current rehabilitation is completed on the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ r@@ ät@@ in J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , rum@@ ors , confir@@ ming that the house that is owned by the federal government , should in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White was not able to say that there are several consider@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily organiz@@ ational psych@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi movement to the Le@@ ch , who had been positively and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years , has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
during the past few decades the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again by closure , departments were closed , for example , the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
tonight , the hand@@ over of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) in the Berg@@ ischer HC .
in Wuppertal , the major leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite , but none of them exist .
in the past season , the Bad@@ ener used a painful defeat during B@@ HC and have some hor@@ des there .

after a death toll , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injury and were brought to hospital .
how it could happen to the accident , it was initially un@@ clear .
the crimin@@ al@@ ers were investig@@ ating .

a crime susp@@ ect led the police to the police of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old native of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ en@@ hausen .
a 16 year old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate which died since Saturday is attacked by violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday night at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as pro@@ secutor and police open on Wednesday .
as a supp@@ orter , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old acts as a supp@@ orter who led the fact conf@@ isc@@ ated and investig@@ ators were brought to the site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not get home as agreed on the eve of a autumn festival in Rock@@ en@@ hausen on Saturday evening .
when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators first stepped on personal belon@@ gings .
in case of surveys in the country of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ance of the missing , a crime scheme was up against the 20 year old .
the alleged perpet@@ rators led the police to a canal in Rock@@ en@@ hausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities said that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police killed and the police have put in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be pre@@ destined at the harbour on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators make him a burden to his burden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issues relating to the immediate conditions of fact should bring the further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study warns of lo@@ dg@@ ings
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees seek a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing structure is facing a challenge .
the distribution fights in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seek@@ ers from the EU increasingly more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens in their final affordable apartments .
in order to cover the demand for affordable housing units , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
to such a result , a trial is based on behalf of the framework of &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
for comparison : this year 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
this way 140@@ .000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees were no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an emergency housing .
many then encounter the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to Federal Statist@@ ical Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing markets , however , is not only to the rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes considerable savings in residential property policy of recent years .
Germany is a housing deficit which is going to be bigger from year to year .
currently about 7@@ 0,000 residential units were missing in metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many working professionals lived in large cities in flat rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the floo@@ ding on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in large cities , the number of square meters per head has decreased again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance , &quot; social housing construction , &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost its social housing again .
the property tax could be om@@ itted and the basic tax has been exposed to the property taxes .
an attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation is also required , according to the alliance .
the subsi@@ dies programme for refugee camps of the State Bank Kf@@ W is right now well in cities and mun@@ icipalities .
a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening with 184 million euros more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project might even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia raise the corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no more perme@@ able , since more refugees are going to choose from Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
however , the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Slovenian Interior Minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; the Croatian Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country is not a Schengen Area .
after the sealing of the Serbian border , hundreds of refugees reached Croatia in order to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RTL reports .
on the day before , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees .
new laws that came into effect on the same day , re@@ vis@@ ing extraordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ ano@@ vic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
most of them are according to media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival , they had tried to reach on foot through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees won &apos;t reach the border .
it has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine cleaning is now spe@@ eding up a safe passage .
after Hungary , close to the closure of the border almost no more refugees arrive .
on Tuesday , the police claimed 3@@ 66 active people .
just before fol@@ ly on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make over@@ coming and damage the bor@@ der@@ a@@ we as an off@@ ense .
in the southern border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 pen@@ al procedures were introduced .
the prisoners sentenced Ar@@ rest War@@ ns to five years and extra@@ dition from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority one received a total of 94 applications on Tuesday to the newly established &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Transfer Care &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , nearly all - 93 - most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applic@@ ant , 13 families with small children and two older people are among the applic@@ ant .
on Wednesday morning there would have been another 40 refugees .
however , practically no one has granted a view to receive asylum in Hungary .
after a Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the exp@@ ired asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
a few hundred refugees assembled in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers started to clean up .
it collected the litter that tens of thousands of people left the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
shut@@ ters have been dismant@@ led and one of the recording stocks in the border area were rebuilt .
for the purpose of this conversion no one wanted to express .
Austria can only reach a few refugees following the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
moreover , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls .
but about the 20,000 migrants were still standing still in the country .
some 1,@@ 400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the further pilgrimage to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor drove &quot; pl@@ ot@@ ted over the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were occupied by the bridge firm on Sunday with the Auf@@ zucht , when ten people stood by travelling off@@ ers at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go on the train to Passau .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany on Sunday , because of the refugee flow from Austria , had surprisingly ceased to be silent for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler , who offered his help and ran along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the river near Passau . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before that , we had the un@@ hoped guests first to be sal@@ es@@ fully , with snack and drinks .
we just said that we bring them to Passau by car .
&quot; this was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; so Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man didn &apos;t let it take to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; this gave us a lot , &quot; says Stad@@ ler .
the stran@@ ded train passages were switched on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train in turn to Passau , and after the short notice of hearing , the train traffic was stopped after Germany , yet to try on the border .
but the regional train was set off at the Inn near W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the bridge firm joined the Bavarian N@@ eigh@@ bours meeting on Sunday , a day before a second round of sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further mill@@ en@@ nia to us , is a logical result of a seem@@ ingly holy policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather than in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the establishment of structures to help Human@@ ity , our ch@@ anc@@ ellor has raised high official and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the dark circle of national socialism .
dam@@ aging of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now facing the border regions with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must also be pointed out , that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ mis@@ ed Land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcome , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a major challenge in view of sustained refugee flows and the coming winter , with us to make decent conditions for refuge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there will be one even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria will maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter signs
Konrad has filled up all his hands with the aid of the refugee .
Christian Konrad is acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed that his word has weight .
the government used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker to place close quarters for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first emergency center Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gotten a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the housing of the 20,000 refugees that came to Austria on Monday had been done without a great vort@@ ex , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interior of the Interior spoke of a &quot; cra@@ cked situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad expects a demand of 8@@ 5.000 quartz in the he@@ ur@@ nal year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will provide the federal states , 15,000 the federal government .
if there are more refugees , we can create it .
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without the floor , &quot; Konrad Adenauer .
he has already taken talks with the state capit@@ als .
they had assured him , even to create more quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ österreich it goes well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supporting Konrad .
tomorrow , there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied as the church is going to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; big expectations are the asylum @-@ Co@@ ordin@@ ator even in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ping as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private individuals can offer simple accommodations .
besides , it is hoping for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ized the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that district court must have a certain height of love @-@ holder or great@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; need to apply &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unlike the Internal Ministry of the Interior , Konrad at the accommodation is more successful , Konrad fo@@ unds with his experience .
I am an older Lord , whom one cannot talk without further into the face of ignorance .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er provo@@ ke the Republic no costs , as they themselves declared .
their number of employees want to increase to three to four .
the own district search was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at st@@ ep@@ han@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
not only opening urban sport@@ s@@ men and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and design center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary , as the person affected could not subject these measures at the moment , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
further locations are to be checked for the emergency .
criticism is the head of the agency in the distribution of refugees in the federal country .
other areas have to contribute here .
seaf@@ ar@@ hofer : &quot; limits will not be sealed &quot;
in a longer phon@@ eme with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , the state captain Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) issued a further increase in the refugee question on Monday .
seaf@@ ar@@ hofer gave me assured that the German borders will not be sealed off .
continuing the rest of the refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
however , there are now the respective border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger demanded more enhanced solidarity in the refugee question at the other EU member states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical follow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as Austria once again brings Austria to its borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general renov@@ ations of the &quot; New Cast &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industry line is officially completed .
in four out of the six store@@ ys of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T are mounted , the rest ( 2700 square meter ) should be hired to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ aus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine how to invest in startup companies of the new shi@@ pyard , and later also acquired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start , S &amp; T want to cooperate with new neighbours - where a lot of things are promising : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next run@@ t@@ astic is only a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from S &amp; T , 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center belonging to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is dominated by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2700 square meter floor area in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it requests .
L@@ ia @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ struc@@ tor opened second store in the arcade
in the new shop , fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are cent@@ ered .
Jutta actually wanted to pick up a dog .
the company had to further ado the 49 year old In@@ cub@@ ator of L@@ ia Per@@ oni into the Do@@ ben@@ a @-@ Ark@@ ade @-@ arcade : after all , it now has an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop opposite the business , in which it sells pockets , bags , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are now available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories for up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
it has been rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered if I want to open a store , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says broad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
decisive for the decision was that the Fur@@ la @-@ producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a dedicated location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only in the greater part of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their fashion interest has been widely laid out by her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most helpful when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman at the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag into a tran@@ ce , the specialist woman can not answer with last safety .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is enhanced every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the oldest ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also connects man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses strange host@@ ile , journalists is concerned or affects knowledge of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Presi@@ dential Office creates the campaign .
and cut well with them .
this is also registered in the Pf@@ äl@@ z K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ on@@ aire desc@@ ends .
the New Yorker , with the F@@ öh@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a not@@ ion of many in the wine village on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pal@@ at@@ inate , Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ t Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers tell about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they &apos;ll find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in its condition , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
the native of K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous n@@ uns , to which apart from Tr@@ ump also includes the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2014 ) too - thus with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has not brought it to the king &apos;s heart .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , but also tend to be that Tr@@ ump is &quot; a little mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
inci@@ dentally , the nickname &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high @-@ German language &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in high @-@ German language , says it .
Tr@@ ump also comes from the village of An@@ ders .
the ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
cor@@ nerst@@ one of the property corporation were first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : her wish to return to his homeland , th@@ wart@@ ed at the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he once had cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ el@@ ic History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , had declared the film start .
dump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the night .
he had repeatedly spoken out about Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a boundary wall to put illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , that isn &apos;t so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ em@@ akers on retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he believe that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm men@@ tions how many k@@ ill@@ st@@ ad@@ ter men@@ tions that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came up with a visit to the church organ , which is generally well done .
&quot; I cannot imagine that from Donald , &quot; the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you find it better if he won &apos;t want the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the ages at the time of his grandfather in the US , would have been like he , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; grapes are also ripe without the President of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
W@@ end@@ els film , for which he was inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ singers but also in the US w@@ akes interest .
the Upper Bavarian community of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Association , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for rolling tourism .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ eer products . &quot;
in neighboring countries , the Alpine Association is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have more than 2,500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of his area must be designated as a colony .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take over the loss of leadership in Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report following the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the reviews for Today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the Federal Republic , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to get Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s down@@ fall .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ator David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ days , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this dis@@ advantage of the insur@@ rection seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise was an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase from the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today Today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
in August , Today , average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 came to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise in comparison to the 3@@ 30,000 .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
so far in September , Sun@@ rise in front of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at today &apos;s 3@@ 14@@ ,000 spectators at Today .
this is the most interesting thing every morning .
the winds of change affect that morning men more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama on a recently ver@@ wit@@ tered father , who decided to settle down New Zealand &apos;s New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 219 million viewers .
critics were wonder@@ ing if Thom@@ son played a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and struck lightly The Block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ B@@ L family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening of The Chase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 until 17.@@ 30 ) of the new tri@@ via show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe was 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators -@@ enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ess Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

the final three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery un@@ revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may obviously have been unable to create a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree .
the woman , finally landed in The bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in The bach@@ elor &apos;s degree , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give away whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we combine with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows the day before the three are checked into checked , you may acci@@ dentally put a note on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps up his lips until the final on Thursday .
all three women have gone out in ly@@ rical way about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of hum@@ our , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his female partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could their answers to play the game , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quick - except yourself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment on when I went to the house and seen ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were pretty in@@ compatible , and I thought it was all over the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ anne &apos;s Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet and it is so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have seen it together and they have the right chem@@ ist .
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit of the house made her clear that Wood &quot; could be one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I &apos;m subject to it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they were asked , who Wood should choose if not she , then she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Tuesday , 19 : 30 on Wednesday .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle have great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent off requests after his impres@@ sing open training day of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , as he lost a don@@ ke as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by @-@ League converter at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next chance to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also into the running game after an injury of George Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ating his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the team he gr@@ ind the mill , he encouraged her .
Tom@@ s@@ ula also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Sport@@ rep@@ orter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Speci@@ alt@@ e@@ ams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to catch his pat@@ inated catch and to worry about the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne pat@@ ched at a Pun@@ t , restored in the first quarter of Minnesota , Minnesota
it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian tra@@ ders for his N@@ FL games had hoped it would be .
Hay@@ ne left the play@@ field after the F@@ um@@ ble flight and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , you just care about the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back in 2007 when a pass took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Queens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the free voters call for a number of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ bon@@ ger at the beginning of the FW @-@ autumn convention in major wall@@ ers in front of a serious crisis in Bay@@ erns schools , if there were no need for the many new students not according to new teachers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we &apos;ll get some adventures in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the regional in@@ gest@@ ion of the Free elec@@ torate continues until Friday in the Unter@@ fr@@ ott@@ k@@ ian Commun@@ e .
the other main themes were actually provided .
but the record number of refugees is now domin@@ ating the free voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ j@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protective zones for refugees in Syria , as they were during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to say to the reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free asylum seek@@ ers want to push the Free elec@@ torate so quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Ai@@ ppers also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts , which are responsible for asylum applications : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief Inspec@@ tor critic@@ ized that several federal states are in@@ consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nation@@ wide uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria ha@@ sten@@ ed , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to be more flexible . &quot;
however , the national policy in big wall@@ ets should not fall under the table .
a long time favourite is on the agenda : policies policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture , Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) , started the &quot; Central Test plus &quot; pilot testing , where an extension of the secondary middle class from three to four years is tested , and then lasts for nine years until the end of his secondary education .
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 has to be accelerated , &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer .
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums that want to do .
free journey at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
after a wide range of distances and nervous trade shows , the German Stock Market closed winn@@ ings with winn@@ ings .
only in the afternoon , a festive pre@@ lu@@ de of the U.S. stock ex@@ changes for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points .
the M@@ DA@@ X sized values won 0.@@ 54 per cent to 19 of 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the new Tec@@ D@@ ax technology rate rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the euro@@ zone 50 serves as a leader in the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 per cent to 320@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also booked the towns in London and Paris .
the Dow Jones Index placed around 1 percent in the plus in the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many w@@ ads predi@@ ct that markets up until after the decision to decide in the US and also for major decay to the schedule on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the discussion about the bur@@ dens of the nuclear phase has meanwhile shifted the number of shares by RW@@ E to a record depth and therefore also behind E@@ on deep scars .
according to the &quot; Spiegel &quot; German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions .
the Federal Government found evidence of the numbers mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies re@@ covers something , but ultimately lost 3@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6,@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares increased by further 3,@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax tip .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US An@@ le@@ ger@@ mag@@ az@@ ins &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; took part in the weekend .
therefore , investors gave to little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
the investments in future collabor@@ ative w@@ afer technologies and focus should focus on the car market .
car values were asked : even in August at the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were dropped than in the previous year , such as the industry association AC@@ EA as the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers of Daimler and BMW expressed themselves by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen pro@@ pul@@ ls are w@@ asted by 1.@@ 26 percent .
the return on the German pension market fell to pre @-@ listed Bundes@@ bank securities to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the share index has increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the euro &apos;s course sun@@ k in the afternoon to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars .
the European Central Bank set off the reference rate on 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) around noon .
the dollar therefore cost 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot at protest@@ ers in Nepal
four people , among them a 4 year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot at a crowd against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 protest@@ ers were assembled outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police had put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before she attacked on rubber shell .
20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber fans used , of which it is known to kill , but are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently thus produced such a high death rate .
the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ tun southern planes where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of F@@ arus , who want to have their own country .
at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10 .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution but a highly controversial topic in Nepal , which has been governed centrally by centuries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the trial after the devast@@ ating earthquake that thousands of people killed in April . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ ature agreed on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional draft in Kathmandu and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
building area planned in the city

Em@@ den - The City of Em@@ den wants to market an area of some 4000 square metres in direct proximity to the youth center of Old Post .
the preparations are underway .
planned to utili@@ ze the premises for a mix of trade , commercial and living .
wait for relevant offers , it is called by the city .
what investor is coming from , is not clear yet .
no contracts were also closed accordingly .
the town of Em@@ den had a part of the land that is located on the Ring@@ straße / Ecke Great Street , already some months ago and let it tear to the building .
project H@@ ie@@ ve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday houses at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor introduced the first public plans for the project .
many pilots couldn &apos;t worry - they fear the sale of their leisure refuge .
for months had been negoti@@ ated behind closed doors , sh@@ ank , deb@@ ated and drawn .
the plans for a new holiday area at the Small Sea near Em@@ den are located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est@@ ing , the mid @-@ sized em@@ ulator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; System Building &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; exhibited on Monday evening in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ de Council for the first time public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , which threw up the investors and the management of intelligence , Ralf Behr@@ ends went on the management board of management in the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said before the members of the Board and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is good to be able to encounter all rum@@ ours now .
the approximately ten to twelve million Euros expensive projects have been in discussion for months .
intense reactions under sea buyers that came in the session shou@@ ting the images and new details on the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , organizers and member of the board of interests of the An@@ gli@@ eger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z , who stands out all other bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , like some other project critics , he would be afraid that traffic would rise by the proposed size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bos@@ ses so that it expects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the good one hectare of the former inn , however , is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we need to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ends .
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were also variable .

Google launches a dual donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a dup@@ licate donations campaign that will raise 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have covered the European nations as they flee from war torn and arm@@ oured countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people are longer living with diabetes after weight loss surgery than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery that wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss @-@ operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to shr@@ ink the size of stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be effective in type 2 diabetes , but most studies were performed in people suffering from disease @-@ mass index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher .
BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BMI : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , which were easily overweight .
the average BMI which under@@ went this operation , fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BMI was on those who did not receive non @-@ surgical treatment treatments roughly equal to 29 .
among those who under@@ went a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes illness was dissolved completely and at 28 % in partial manner .
in contrast , the medical @-@ treated group compared the diabetes by only one percent and partly in only about two percent .
moreover , the results were in the scope of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ ceri@@ des , and the &apos; bad &apos; L@@ DL cholesterol &apos; in general better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , found the authors .
the researchers have also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , writing the researcher .
after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c fell by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as it reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared well the average results with the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group had lost weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , more weight lost in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 5.1 % ) and reported rather a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of the surgery following five years , there are indications from a study of serious people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , there was a obes@@ e person who under@@ goes about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , the conventional methods tried .
although the new study does not have an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it &apos;s soothing for people with a BMI less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BMI is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , once the patient is between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , their bodies are firmly linked with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a subject that currently applies in fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , hits the flock of her youth after years , and this falls in love with them .
so also in the recently published Roman &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
beyond the love story , the novel is particularly interesting for H@@ uns@@ rü@@ ger readers , because he plays in long @-@ wheat and surrounding towns .
the au@@ strian writer grew up in long @-@ st@@ ler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe couldn &apos;t take all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East fly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of continuing refugee crisis at the beginning of his 10 day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford which dev@@ otes itself to ethics .
he said that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries was ad@@ owed to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech .
although the Dalai Lama has engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we have to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added .
the Dalai Lama promised to issue the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s conduct after the terrorist attack of 11th September and issued that the violent response to the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences to President Bush , and I told him , the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; I know , his motives were good , but he put violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama .
4 times increase of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
poison @-@ control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age containing strong alcoholic hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues by hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants increased by children under 12 years of age containing le@@ ft@@ ment centers , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children always come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go to the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN .
he said that some children have disinf@@ ect@@ ants to drink while some of them do to im@@ press their friends or because of a mut@@ iny on social media .
videos on YouTube show how you@@ thful disinf@@ ect@@ ants drink just because of a cheap experience .
young people have report@@ edly made disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mou@@ th@@ wash water to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive no@@ zzles of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the cat@@ ti@@ ring ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ o@@ illed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , wine grapes and orange juice , which are very appe@@ aling for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
few spra@@ w@@ ls can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially with small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ ch Centre at the University of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t have a si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ j@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year old girl , who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es from after straw@@ berry shower of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in school was taken into a emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of which at an adult to be drunk in law , Dr. Chris became a emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ nat@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ j@@ jah started her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors have monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma when the girl fell through the alcohol and had disturbed his head , he said ey .
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; says Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah@@ s , and CNN .
it could have been deadly to my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to utili@@ ze alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants from the reach of the child .
beyond alcohol pois@@ oning some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were linked with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , not declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities susp@@ ect that the product was contained meth@@ anol , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ anol which was recorded as an active agent .
in January , three pupils from the fourth class in New York sought to poison their &quot; mix@@ ers &quot; teacher by placing an anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ y , &quot; thus , there will be a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
the police approached the hidden plan as &quot; Gesch@@ w@@ ät@@ z , &quot; and directed the disciplinary action to the school authority .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ours about Dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was spont@@ ane@@ ously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insist@@ ed that he and his team mates won &apos;t be under elevated control as they prepare for confron@@ tation with the Dutch table guide .
I don &apos;t think that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of championship competition in Scottish football - Dut@@ chman - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games , and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the old @-@ fir@@ m games , and there are not only people who want to see those games .
I will turn the things around , swe@@ ars D@@ eil@@ a .
Ron@@ ny D@@ eil@@ a has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian leader s@@ wore to deal with things .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League , the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , followed by five @-@ point lead lead to the top of the table .
but D@@ eil@@ a said : &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel exactly like this - but we must go on .
we really don &apos;t really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
now matching is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton caution in January @-@ transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in summer have this pre@@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by giving the need@@ less players to add what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is increasing .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July , while the number of people in the United Kingdom had risen to the United Kingdom in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million .
the Scottish unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the top of 5.5 percent , as demonstrated by the figures for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .
meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell over 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the annual average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .

why I WI@@ LL be a Exec@@ ution in Oklahoma
somewhat later , except during a late legal intervention , I will see how a man will be put to death .
if it happens , and I hope that it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the death chamber in Oklahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed .
when the day was closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will see exec@@ utions throughout the US , and there are often more applicants than seats at the disposal of a mak@@ es@@ ere lot@@ tery , to decide who is chosen .
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media points from 12 to five .
who is chosen , it will be emotional to watch .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps in closest friends , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pr@@ ison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all details .
a journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the det@@ ain@@ ment as he wants , and you will receive access .
I compl@@ ained with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they cleared they could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants a international rep@@ orter to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations work will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a rep@@ orter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me .
if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of Podcasts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all details here .
I cannot say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese owe him to be a benef@@ ici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ih@@ ood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence in order to justify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I shall see him die .
I can not claim to be real objective .
there will be other rep@@ orters , which you can contact .
what you will get of me is what it means to die a man an in@@ sufficient death .

his efforts were successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben Cou@@ sins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to stop racing
Peter Moo@@ dy said that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria attempts to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race at once .
he focused on Ste@@ wards and the Integration Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said to Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for racing , and he himself found himself under difficult conditions when it was around the positive Cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the esp@@ ion@@ age predi@@ ctions and did not want it to see as too high dro@@ pping grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that there was fur@@ ing .
sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head , and I would like my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they begin to think , I do not do it , then I should not be a coach .
I have to consider what I do with my license .
before that Moo@@ dy had launched the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integration Department had attempted to sp@@ ying out his barn .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - I will give him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I am doing within my st@@ alls , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com .
you believe that I am an im@@ post@@ or .
if this is the case , they certainly ought to have their n@@ oses , because they try to sei@@ ze me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of that at the time and are still today .
should this bring me a view , that it becomes personally ?
did the RV@@ L face oneself and make people responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people think outside I &apos;m there .
perhaps they must take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say I can now think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will put the pressure on them and pushing them back to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ str@@ ations of trainers have set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt @-@ examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could throw his license above the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparations for the &apos; In@@ chi@@ pped &apos; Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the racing daily treatment was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack was made mud or clay , which wor@@ shi@@ ped the rules .
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my associates left ir@@ rig@@ or@@ ously on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
it had , however , also on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far &quot; said Moo@@ dy said .
arrested man after pits
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a c@@ lash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cursed in Cob@@ ash@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered by helicopter to the Royal Poker Hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said that drivers continued to stop without stopping the injured drivers .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man from Nath@@ alie will leave the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and dest@@ itute assistance and due to other traffic del@@ ights .
the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . it is in a stable condition .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy to fight against ri@@ vals against claims on h@@ ack@@ ers
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy is critic@@ ized by the Tac@@ kling of his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rator launched the Storm players &quot; Ring@@ strive &quot; with his team during the high Storm Sie@@ gs in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Bennett has made an appeal to the Storm team after his squ@@ ad had reached the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queens@@ land were not too good &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and told that she was just concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team agree with confidence , as it means concerned that they were worried about the Storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s all over again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ fights when she had struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year . however , in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tical on a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . it is therefore probably not used to get used to it , so it was a bit of shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how this time to occur again at this time of time .
Bell@@ amy was attacked by Benn@@ ie idea about &quot; exciting football , &quot; and remember his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ettes St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Drag@@ ons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their play was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that St. George was critic@@ ized as a boring team in 2010 , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially its young players with their speed .
this is the ball@@ game that you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play .
I build up trust because they tell these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it went to Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the Bron@@ cos game against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more tests in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks , and do not points something exciting ?
for me , it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet again in one phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend as it is the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the Vor@@ finals in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales will start next Tuesday tomorrow .
Ser@@ bier with 200.000 $ deposit to drug ad@@ mon@@ y
a man who possibly dro@@ ves a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his failure to get to land of 40 kilos of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Queens@@ land , has been released for a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he also met his co @-@ def@@ endant in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ standing sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that it would have no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the Café could have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was worried about the danger of death at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday .
during the Trial Chamber , he lied on the police via his place of residence .
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics matern@@ ity and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200.000 dollars as a safety for his release .
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ al declar@@ ations of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200.000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Flan@@ agan .
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to hold him away , not to appear , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , and is reported at the police cur@@ few at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to attract students to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ ly used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , blo@@ ated into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
she looked through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed her mother immediately .
the police knew about it and saw the five images , analyzed the computer which were found under the address and discovered &quot; web searches , the terms for the search for unc@@ eas@@ ingly images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ og@@ g claimed to the officers he did it , as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Educ@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Heads of State E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction that he is ad@@ di@@ cted to fri@@ gh@@ ten people .
he gave way that the searching for the computer was carried out on him said it happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to fri@@ gh@@ ten wor@@ ries .
he was asked for his discussions with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more pictures .
he said he did so to enti@@ ce them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the messages on the telephone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and at the weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , declared themselves guilty in terms of indictment , un@@ decent images of children on the 14th of June this year , and not to be appearing on court appearances on 24 March this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Defense Minister Gregor S@@ im asked that H@@ og@@ g could not appear in the Register of sexual off@@ ences , as you could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no real sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his failure is to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to get background reports about social work .
H@@ og@@ g was granted the deposit in this case but was kept in temporary detention for hear@@ ings to others .
it was still enrolled before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual off@@ ences .
floo@@ ding devi@@ ates to small border cros@@ sings to Germany
more and more refugees are ri@@ pped off the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many Schle@@ user made fear of discovery and arrest of people increased to smaller border trans@@ itions .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , Passau and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have been taken out more than 1000 refugees along the border down@@ river Inn .
they were walking over bridges and tra@@ ps to the German side .
there they are taken from Federal Police in Reception and for@@ warded to the registration .
at Munich &apos;s main station , in comparison to the weekend of the weekend , more than more refugees met again after the weekend of the weekend .
around 700 people have arrived in the capital alone up to 8.00 hrs , and a speaker said in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ erunner of Trop@@ y storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest
meteor@@ ologist war@@ n against storm tunes in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
the German weather service ( D@@ WD ) divided into Stuttgart because of a deep @-@ pressure area across Western Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful bass is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who crossed the Atlantic in the past few days over the Atlantic Ocean . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and storms are expected especially in Baden .

on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the mass makes it : every two years , the car is show@@ casing its new products at the IAA .
2015 is the most important movement of the compact car , which is currently particularly well selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : approximately 2@@ 8.1 percent of the new appro@@ vals failed , according to the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is reflected in the IAA ( People &apos;s days , 17th to 27th September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concepts and luxury cars and luxury cars will be presented many new compact models this year .
one of the biggest pre@@ m@@ ons for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , who will be at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann pointed to the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
this means that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
Opel sets a top view of the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in a view that starts at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra is from 16 € 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with a 74 kW / 100 HP engine .
in addition , the Hessen also offer further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time include three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel Astra is initially only a fifth .
the second variant will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is already shown at the IAA .
and what is next next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra &apos;s competitors in the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e only comes as a fifth in a conventional and a emphas@@ ised sporty GT version .
he comes to trade in the beginning of next year , then also as a com@@ bi .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Lock wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines adap@@ ts to the design line of the brand .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
in the offer , a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp is also available .
Suzuki Bal@@ eno : the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , will be its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is achieved by manufacturers at 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) .
the sale of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed , the compact starter model DS 4 which is shown at the IAA .
the designers of the precious Citro@@ ë@@ n she@@ er put at the front end on the front : here , the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , which reduces number of buttons through a touch@@ screen and integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time .
at the IAA in the compact class , a series of over@@ working and new variants like the freshly re@@ bran@@ ded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 308 GT@@ I .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell are decent
the Federal Constitutional Court given an Ex @-@ in@@ mate of the judicial authorities in law that was lodged in a small cell for months .
due to the injury of human dignity , prisoners have basically eligible for financial compensation , if they are located in small cells .
that ruled the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the affected may even hope to judge the judge even if they were imprisoned for a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional order was successful in Karlsruhe ; he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell in Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who once again finds himself on the free foot , was laid in a larger cell .
his de@@ g@@ ain@@ ants because of the worth@@ less arrest warrant against the Land of Berlin failed .
but the judges with@@ drew the judgment of the Chamber of Justice in Berlin and referred the case for re @-@ verification .
they see the man injured .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
although for legal reasons only a few days of arrest for the compensation were issued , a statement is given , it was said .
otherwise , &quot; they would &quot; be a bo@@ ther of the legal protection of personality . &quot;
the chamber @-@ court must now clari@@ fy the amount of damage .
the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
they therefore spoke to a prisoner in April , because he was in prison naked in a prison cell .
according to in@@ humane , a single cell &apos;s multi @-@ cham@@ ber@@ ation can also be found without separate toilet in 2011 .
moreover , in addition , the Berlin Constitutional Court also confirmed a decent accommodation in November 2009 on Wednesday , by a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ ism in November 2009 .
the former pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff participated in a similar cell in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours .
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come to the head@@ lines during the last few weeks due to lack of personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to pun@@ ches it should already come because of the stressed location .
according to the judicial authorities , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to junior staff , 19 should be om@@ itted in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the migration of refugees is a huge challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor has decided to take it .
what comes to Germany ?
according to the forecasts published by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture in Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany , according to Vice President , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) shows about the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We can do this and we can do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany does the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 500@@ 00 ( estimate of the German Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - and the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as ever built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
dramatically is the lack of living space but especially for affordable rental objects : every year , 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social apartments come out of the rental price , and in order to advert@@ ise these particularly advant@@ ageous apartments will also apply refugees .
the Federal Minister for Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the Pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social apartments annually would have to be created and the association would have to invest in an amount of 6.4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and the Federal Minister of Germany agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it can be assumed that over the long term , 55 percent of poultry in Germany can be employed .
however , the refugees in Germany were not required to support them systematically after their qualification , he critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , a project man@@ ager@@ ess for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
for the integration of refugees , it is crucial if they are finding a job in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording society but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of migrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mig@@ ration@@ er Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Thr@@ än@@ gler , Germany has announced a political turn : from work banned for refugees to recognise the work .
while earlier a job ban had been offered for asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ dency , the asylum seek@@ ers is limited to a residence .
in society as well as for professionals - mostly the visibility is under@@ estimated that refugees should be made faster to the labour market faster .
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing German language skills .
there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses yet .
studies show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , according to opinion from Thr@@ än@@ hardt , networking is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few @-@ wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root parents , &quot; Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , says spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to persu@@ ade the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration of hand@@ books in different languages .
if the need of educ@@ ators go strong by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase training capacity - by taking more technical schools .
in the countries students can be prepared in the classroom with no knowledge of German .
they are not always taught by teachers trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no lack of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ade from the Berlin School Administration .
the student estimates that around 20 percent of refugees are planning to study in Germany .
similarly , no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or toler@@ ated the study - the only exception to the present was Berlin , but In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) has now abandoned its position .
the greater part of the refugees could be facil@@ itated by the university .
because refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce do not get any services after the asylum seek@@ er if they begin studying .
the latter is generally not a BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G because they do not fall under the circle of b@@ af@@ ro@@ omed persons .
remember@@ ing had to have lived for four years in Germany to be eligible for BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this sp@@ r shortened to 15 months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this financial crisis must also be closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the student . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ f@@ ö@@ G .
Islam will soon play a more important role , as many refugees are Muslims ; and for many , religion is important part of their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually introduce the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches ri@@ ghtly to develop into a new state @-@ religions ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the creation of an Islamic welfare association , which professionally takes care of the new arri@@ vals .
the Right also includes duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to join the state in many areas and to in@@ duce certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , the will@@ ingness to move controls against religious fundament@@ alism .
the chair of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , promp@@ ted the concern of religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ de such conflicts in Germany have immediately condemned their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed that the Basic Law was Arabic to Arabic .
in the future , integration will be much more than today a theme of the whole society .
in doing so , the majority society must change , de@@ mining of discrimination and rac@@ ism is pressed .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade .
but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the NSU series , in the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same odds for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and stak@@ eholders did not commit for long and are to become reality for the next years as the Anti@@ rac@@ ism of Germany must remain in the next few years , if the country will remain peac@@ efully and its new citizens - for the sake of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally Germany is capable of supplying the expected refugees to so far , vice @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; what concerns Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel .
however , the money needs to flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all references to the registration Health cards are required .
services could be accounted for later with the federal states .
and in the long term it was highly question@@ able so many people with the limited power catalog look forward to the asylum seek@@ ers Act .
otherwise doctors will most likely do the barriers of speech .
already so far , the Berlin science scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de proved that migrants are po@@ or@@ ly understood about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , calls for them .
many refugees in the emergency out@@ patients would also be helped by many refugees too .
and with another diagnostic look .
among refugees , there are much more un@@ treated disability , and with the young people I go to HIV @-@ clari@@ fication .
with the partially other clinical pictures , German doctors comes from vocational training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite diarr@@ he@@ a or tuber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and about the trouble of trouble is perhaps even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system , many refugees even have doctors .
however , in order to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualification and may perhaps fall apart again .
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany , according to estimates of the Federal Labour Chamber ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ologically ill : most suffer from a post trau@@ matic stress distur@@ b@@ ance or depression .
especially viol@@ able are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU München shows that any fifth Syrian refugee girl is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
who is suffering from a Post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder is suffering from the so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , warmth and death difficulties .
other symptoms include sleep and lack of concentration , severe injury and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms of chronic suffering , it was necessary to treat early treatment , Mun@@ z declared .
so far only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can provide a request for a therapy in the social offices , however , the processing lasts for several months .
moreover , in social offices , experts or physi@@ cians who are not trained for mental illnesses , should decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .

Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs in the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly throughout the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also troubled by cont@@ en@@ tions of M@@ EPs from the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats , and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe for calls with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen .
last month , they had hat@@ ched him and interrupted him during his speech at the State of the Nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokesperson for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Opp@@ os@@ itions @-@ politicians have received SMS messages on their phones , they warned them to distur@@ b Mr. Mu@@ release speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to the public speech .
it warns members of Parliament that the unity of the Parliament will end , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , its parliamentary imm@@ unity is no longer effective .
the spokes@@ man said that the party was guided by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
Hewlett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to build up 25.000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP is split into two listed companies and split the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job reduction will lead to a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this restructuring measures become a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive Officer to divide the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hewlett Packard Enterprise is less and stronger than it &apos;s today , and we have a broad portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion $ annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s led by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electric plants and the Palo Alto Garage you are called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring , in order to manage the return from traditional computers to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that strongly foc@@ uss@@ ed businesses produce better performance .
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta tell you te@@ amm@@ ates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ized Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September and when his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ears is sure to miss for at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer on the European Championship is uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate an@@ ank@@ le injury and then found back to his old swing during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury does not threatened the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
it is a bone that has not been well cur@@ led .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries that he had before .
this may be true from purely medical perspective , but as humble also , there is the associated risk of further injuries , becoming a player trying to return in the middle of the season .
it also evol@@ ves an un@@ comfortable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 out of arsen@@ al 157 Lig@@ ises in the last five play times .
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight play times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs were one of the most vulner@@ able days to be recorded .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in vulner@@ ability will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from injury , you have a vulner@@ able period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fight force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope that his body stabili@@ zes itself , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the type he deserves .
Arsenal starts his Champions League Cup final on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo &apos;s Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on the upcoming Wednesday and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not traveled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are starting to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and give the players who need it a little bre@@ ather , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ sites with the largest inti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
the stadium was sh@@ aken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , with a total length of 3.2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains far away from the far hope to lead the club to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked out with arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I have long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy Show , giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially regarding the need for men to open up now , now more desper@@ ate than ever before , as compl@@ ain@@ ees with young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in the effort to tackle the problem , the Campaign against Living Mis@@ er@@ als ( CA@@ LM - Campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) announced as the year of the man to ask the aim of asking the culture to seek assistance , when they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in battle to master this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms felt that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood . &quot; his chances on recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends hal@@ ved the risks of mental problems .
but of course one must have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the era of communication guided through social media , with its focus on style , the in@@ ability of answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital living have the need to da@@ zzle strongly , vital and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ ins@@ an values name ; money , image , social status , all at cost in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affect our mental health much deeper .
and just like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money cannot really buy happiness .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , who gle@@ aned through the interaction of a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a employee of telephone calls it explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listen@@ er role for people who are de@@ pressed and vulner@@ able should really show me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a huge impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you are talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to me when I try to offer long @-@ term employment mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so very my objective ou@@ ter@@ body status over the phone can also help people in moments of desp@@ air too , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ arranged setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k with us .
or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and tell him hello .
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets PS@@ G to help Mal@@ ö too
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malm@@ ö .
here are the playsite and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain held his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ berg stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but thereafter it adapted a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani made a head@@ board at the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in Group A needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ rounds but an improvement on the way to the quad@@ ru@@ al in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was no classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ him@@ ov@@ ics missed chances in front of the club . he later became in play against his home town team and against the club , with which he started his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 .
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or somewhere in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to cause our opponents to create and rela@@ unch our opponents , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Mont .
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , who was able to hold a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was conceived in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing @-@ wing was named as the man who ran the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he ran in to Manchester United in last month , and he noted down in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would win a big victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stepped onto the field with nine national players on the field and was w@@ asted with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle area a heavy opponent .
but in addition to a shot by Nikola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ es in the 3@@ 4th minute , they gave up little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself had itself on , with some mis@@ pun@@ ches and bad battles , not least by Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , who was pat@@ ched at no less than five trials only in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had put it after the restart .
however , he demonstrated a lot more skill than he brought his players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ him@@ ovic , whom Di Maria has turned into a shoot , which was passed by Wil@@ and at the 5@@ 2nd minute of the pass ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay scored his sixth part of the season after Ibra@@ him@@ ovic family had put up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this concluded all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could go back to the game , and only one excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result before surro@@ gate E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we played only in the Swedish division , which has not the same level .
the trials are not enough . &quot;
hat from before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 transition to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi will play for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern obviously stood before the pursu@@ it of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time of FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot;
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion league champion , two times winner world champion , two times European champion , two time champion , the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in summer , 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi disp@@ at@@ ches now that he was already leaving Spain prior to the 2008 departure .
&quot; one told me that Bar@@ ça is selling me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we told nothing . &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi changed
but the change did not come about .
and the resulting man currently works for the German record maker : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça launched Gu@@ ardi@@ ola &apos; contract and I played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; PE@@ P said to me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot;
&quot; for that he has gotten me . &quot;
who knows , how Bay@@ erns did run in the 2008 / 2009 season with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bayern on the lawn , rounded off the red ones ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the victory at the end of the King &apos;s triumph .
Matt Dam@@ on plays host in films .
Matt Dam@@ on tried the af@@ ro@@ amer@@ ican film maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said they &apos;re not needed behind the scenes .
as a result of the Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown broke out as this will emphas@@ ize the necessity of alternative perspectives , namely , with respect to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project .
&quot; when we talk about diversity , please do it with the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with off@@ ended un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor fied by The Mar@@ tian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the center of production Ben Mon@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director , how she will handle the character of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a sp@@ line that is beaten by her white sugar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of Y@@ ale White People is a director for the fin@@ alists , Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on said that their direc@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip , writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - it &apos;s SO WH@@ ITE that it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since his release .
Dam@@ on comments will come at a time on the exact rac@@ ist representation in the media at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager has killed Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Li@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Movement and urged the legislative and authorities to apply any discri@@ min@@ ating practices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February , the singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent , &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) he said .
as books and black life , albums have still their importance .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Movement will publish a declaration in response to the question of Fox News Person@@ ality by Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a H@@ ass group .
the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .

Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time when he finished the first Ath@@ let , which finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock on winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went with The Hollywood rep@@ orter to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
based on the rules , money is the quick@@ est person .
&quot; when there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alists , they are the fastest time &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and life is changed , he receives the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think that it swe@@ eps about it .
he is just so lucky to have done what he did .
he received many awards of awards .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same , if they had changed the rolls .
America Ninja Warrior was extended to play a season , and the filming will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers gr@@ its to Minnesota T@@ wins
mint - The second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the tiger stands on the last place in the American league Central .
the tig@@ ers reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but they played perfect for the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins split a chance for asc@@ ending inside a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , if only for an evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was difficult to gras@@ p over a big part of the season so difficult .
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Exclu@@ si@@ m said .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two door@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three ranks .
it was only his third succ@@ es@@ ful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; Simon said .
it is hard to throw up each game in the bull@@ do@@ ers , and therefore I want to totally concentrated in the game .
the designated tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ star @-@ hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle as on 6 July .
&quot; he has deteri@@ or@@ ated the striking thing , &quot; said exclusion .
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , looked much better off in the bull@@ do@@ ir , and he brought it straight into play .
with three ranks in the h@@ ind at the end of seventh heaven , T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a colorful , and Simon presented his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed bl@@ az@@ er Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy was passing the wall , the only man facing he was confronted with the designated Rook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who was wearing a two @-@ run .
with a pair of runners and the finishing run in the second , Ver@@ hagen directly hit the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the major league for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe was a double play .
after Detroit added a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth @-@ bottom , wall entered a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored a 5 @-@ 4 stand .
the right hand , however , S@@ ano came out at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth generation .
in Detroit , the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game benefited from a still no moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three wheels in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been kn@@ itted before the game from the po@@ aching list , after having fired over a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the start I had wished for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I felt better when I started to get some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ aly@@ a released a single to The Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game that made a single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed to present their 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the players in the Scor@@ ing Position .
the third bass Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , finished another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he was trying to get to the third , what the threat ended .
the tig@@ ers put on second in the second one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins Manager Paul Mol@@ itor said .
he did not happen very well , but he cat@@ ched the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rec@@ ie@@ ver rec@@ al@@ right A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were about three hits and one walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal San@@ chez retired because of a violation of the inc@@ lin@@ ers .
he was investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on the injury list for a shoulder of shoulder , is to be activated for launch on Wednesday .
with San@@ chez out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted against the injury list to start the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been mes@@ h@@ ed on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees are to come down in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the number of people stim@@ ulated in Wiesbaden should be lodged in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday night .
it projected an increase of 450 to 750 every time .
several sports halls of the German capital were prepared for this fall in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporary there .
they should then be distributed to other mun@@ icipalities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the responsible government of the government , Gießen has received 7@@ 500 people in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au arranged for the great number of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ ora because of the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the di@@ ap@@ sed demand of military action options cannot be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he designed the European states to adopt a collective facing . &quot;
four years ago , one was glad to have passed the cup of military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict arises in front of our door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise of international assistance locally for refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
according to Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday night in the Austrian broad@@ c@@ aster ORF , and now no one is sent back to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Germany has sent no refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , this is agreed , &quot; she declared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding a deal , a certain number of refugees from Austria could take up a particular number of refugees from Austria each day , said Mich@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already given such discussions between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she didn &apos;t called them concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria through the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ cane route from Hungary to Austria .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for the next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states did not have to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the ministers of the Interior intend to adopt a new attempt on the binding distribution of additional 120 000 refugees .
in view of the strong refugee community in Germany , the federal government wants to increase the country &apos;s premi@@ er and distribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association will manage this together with the countries that the Merkel announced on the late Tuesday night after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Merkel under@@ lined the Merkel , those people who ro@@ ar the shelter , they also mark them .
but who doesn &apos;t have a lead @-@ out , can &apos;t stay in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was basically shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ anc@@ ellor stressed that the state as a whole &quot; st@@ ems a &quot; enormous effort . &quot;
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have now been stuck at the Bal@@ kan@@ och .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometers long border into Serbia in the night .
a few hours on that , the government in Budapest announced also the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary would assume that the tugs moved out over Romania , said Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister , Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ on said to the planned new border .
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first adher@@ ence of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , because of the e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of migrants are report@@ edly on their way to the Greek border .
room of Space &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; takes the ocean into Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
from the E@@ isp@@ ser of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us s@@ nap a global ocean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers conclude from observ@@ ations of the Space probe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , the moon moves lightly on its rail to ring the ring planets .
this exchange movement is only small , but still too big for a continuous cel@@ est@@ ial body , is called it in a communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers are preparing their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .
even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the base of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ir@@ vul@@ can@@ es in 2006 on the south pole of Saturn , to sp@@ ain the water vap@@ or and to feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers joined at that time .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
Rama is missing in 1860 more weeks
the 1860 München has to do without a month on the open actor Val@@ det Rama .
an investigation indicates an ad@@ ran@@ ce injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , shared the association with .
Rama had su@@ ed a pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis therefore means &quot; four weeks forced break . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , Rama is a her@@ ent loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ ben@@ n der &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper with views of the possible commitment of a non @-@ talented professionals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the training of training the six@@ ti@@ ers presented a De@@ fen@@ sives at first .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old H@@ r@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg .

Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team &apos;s training following his bra@@ ins .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player should enter a running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie had been in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a fierce coll@@ ision in his head .
contrary to the first ap@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion , however , he remained without a heavy sh@@ utter .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but he who wants to pay attention to his slender line , often rather ram@@ bled away from them .
because Mang@@ os contain relatively many sugar - mainly Sac@@ char@@ ose .
healthy fruits are still healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. Pri@@ or are mainly male and vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta car@@ otene .
if you eat the fruit , it supports t@@ end@@ on , immune system and met@@ abolic processes in the body .
when purchasing , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or firm and smell pleas@@ antly .
the switch colour alone does not say anything like the fruit is ripe - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and are consumed within a few days .
then they taste great and pure in sweet foods .
a man@@ go man@@ goes but also sav@@ ory dishes a special touch .
they alle@@ vi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf@@ lets such as Chic@@ ore@@ e and Radi@@ c@@ cio .
and a Mang@@ oh@@ ut@@ ney works well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison .

first sigh@@ ted rush , then mark@@ ante cold front
in the next night in the valleys of the Alp@@ in side of the F@@ öh@@ n valley breaks through , as met@@ e@@ o@@ schwei@@ z hur@@ ried on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night of the night , the F@@ öh@@ n runs partly on the f@@ ooth@@ es .
on Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , the strong rain falls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature shift .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently located on the front of a vast deep @-@ printing area across the British Is@@ les in a strong South @-@ southwest exposure .
at the Alp@@ enn@@ ord@@ side , in the night of the F@@ öh@@ n valley breaks through the valleys .
as a consequence , the F@@ öh@@ n bl@@ ends up to th@@ urs@@ day in the f@@ ades with ar@@ ches from 60 to 100 km / h and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land part even more than 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can penet@@ rate up until the adjacent middle and mountains , and on the mountains are even organs of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer resulted in summer@@ y temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the Alpine Je@@ w@@ ess starts to st@@ ow away .
here rains here , which lasts up to Thursday evening .
in sum , south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , some 100 litres of rain per square meter will be expected , after the last days already large rainf@@ alls are already fell .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ öh@@ n runs out the air , in the episode , a cold front rolls with a strong , some swe@@ at@@ y rain from the West to East via Switzerland .
together with the cold front the wind picks up heavily until stor@@ my , and the temperatures drop clearly .
the following days are in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes the weekend sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
almost 500 years after the Reformation , Rome is now a Martin @-@ Luther Square .
in the presence of the Italian President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino has been christ@@ ened a well @-@ known place in the park on the Opp@@ io Hill , on the name of the German Re@@ former .
in Piazza Martin Luther , he is now honored as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome , next to the Colos@@ se@@ um .
the rally was requested from the work community of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , re@@ minded that Protest@@ ants were able to live in the city of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a minority .
the square is visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ ine fri@@ ch for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
it took the city back then as a dec@@ eased sin@@ ner .
its negative impressions are encouraged him by hist@@ ori@@ ans in his later battle against Rome .
Luther continued with his thes@@ es against the insur@@ ers in the split of the end@@ on@@ dic church .
hammer perform@@ ers invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt created for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with magnificent images .
in the beginning the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 different motives has formulated its very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with multic@@ ol@@ oured colors and fan@@ ciful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by not syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : the corresponding topics can be quite glo@@ omy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project , which he has made a subjective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subjective selection from the many theme parts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote topics like cru@@ stac@@ eans , pl@@ agues , commandments or pat@@ ern@@ ity .
he was fascinated spont@@ ane@@ ously several partners spont@@ ane@@ ously : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag , with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing company with its focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the related Bible sites on the basis of painting .
he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into today , into current context . &quot;
these texts are like verbal pre @-@ painting mirrors .
in addition they are embedded in the original Bible quot@@ ations of Martin Luther and each with a sentence of the artist who formulated his personal thoughts on the particular situation here .
the jewel@@ ery cord has golden letters .
thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows a deep insight into his soul , emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who grew up in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family owned by the strict Protestant representative .
&quot; as the education happened with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work up that perhaps again to carry me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim , to re@@ leg@@ alise the art in rapid period of time : &quot; the awareness of pictures is marked today by advertising , and it is noisy .
symbol@@ ism is being edged out there .
artists have different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; I am a din@@ osau@@ r in this respect . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take up the viewer into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; let them reveal , detect and feel that power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for its object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost passed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to live with his paintings . &quot;
I have not considered the Bible to fully capture the Bible , but most important topics for him .
&quot; it was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explained only . &quot; it was a picture of images .
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - Paper and screens - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail is approaching .
plans made , place found , company contra@@ cted to model ground attack for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - yet before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already concluded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration provided for dr@@ ill@@ ings , especially among residents who wouldn &apos;t toler@@ ate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so hill marked up , new place looking - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the permission to follow in October was now informed by the First Municipal Council of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it then should be started without &quot; further commem@@ orative break &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga set a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Foot@@ respon@@ ds respon@@ ds to the conducting situation in Germany and guarantees the policy its help in addressing the coming problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I consider it the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in the principle that nothing comes to me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be every individual in order to get this subject in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the ch@@ anc@@ ellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ j@@ uz and ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the theme will probably play a central role , &quot; he announced .
football can help and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must set the politics .
the German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach stated on the br@@ ink of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also , some Bundes@@ lig@@ ists support this program .
as early as this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ ines set a clear sign when it comes to the left tri@@ cot kern@@ els instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Hermes ) . &quot; we can help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make sure that all will help , where and how they can help , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ ser Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper ( Tuesday ) and signed the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ comprehen@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is about everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can choose soccer rules , no , we need to use our radi@@ ance to help our influence and possibilities to help many refugees that have suffered so incredibly well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on Friday to take part in this Friday .
Nier@@ s@@ bach proclaimed the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal work in German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensed players had started their own projects , would be great .
equally great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; which we have spent is lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : head of SAP in an accident loses eye
the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye for several reports by a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the US , he fell to a water glass after midnight that he had worn in his left hand , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business week &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he is almost li@@ ken@@ ed , was f@@ ain@@ ted and then moved out to drag@@ ging out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP Co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his work .
&quot; in early October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board of Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting with &quot; full @-@ fit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to continue the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to him it is important to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to rise again when you are fallen . &quot;
McLaren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ ussen out of battle ...
Magn@@ ussen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ med a promising picture and suffered an injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes to Singapore on the weekend as little as a reserve driver for the two Stam@@ ets Fernando Al@@ onso and Jen@@ son Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ EU@@ s versus Kras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ tables in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes of a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ EU@@ s were finally defeated in the first group of group play of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing in the soccer league of the Bundesliga with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him , &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday .
whether R@@ EU@@ s will be back in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen in front of Le@@ verk@@ usen : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
because of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only alter its ancest@@ or eleven at the R@@ EU@@ s position .
so he announced a shift at the door place .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is holding the place of k@@ ke@@ epers Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the World S@@ occ@@ er World Champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller comes to action in all Europe league games , however , Tu@@ chel has left open .
with high probability he will also deny the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the continuing statement of Mit@@ sui R@@ EU@@ s that the final decision for the Bv@@ B in the Europe League will be the goal , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ trac@@ table : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead leading role for Germany
according to the will of the federal government , Germany should be the transformation of the car technical fir@@ ing .
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Finance Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke at the Frankfurt Motor Show at the br@@ ink of a &quot; new mobile age &quot; at the br@@ ink of IAA . &quot;
the automated driving driving will increase road safety and ensure less st@@ akes , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , coming together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the strategic paper of the Department of Transport emphas@@ izes the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy response to digital radio teleph@@ ony .
at the time testing of new technology a test track is currently being generated on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions and , where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , Germany plans to use internationally for ensuring maximum speed for passenger car @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
moreover , the Federal Government wants to deplo@@ y a change in the Vienna Convention , which previously only sees people as a driver .
when driving , the car increases the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process data in a matter of seconds .
according to a study proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , mobile vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study &apos;s value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the German site estimate that the study was estimated at about 8.4 billion euros by 2025 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic polit@@ ician S@@ ören Bart@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clari@@ fied .
even the Germans are still scep@@ tical about the Germans - much more than French or Americans .
a survey on the AA road@@ map on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA results in the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not count at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of respon@@ dents begin by 2025 with autonomous driving cars , in the US 33 percent .
anyway , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of digital verb@@ ose , only seven percent would agree that check out control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the free@@ way , traffic could be less than 15 per cent , at stag@@ nation 45 percent .
under every fourth , the car would leave the control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says Team@@ - and Double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Düsseldorf plans to present only at the title battle of September 25 to October 4 only in single . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the final decision will be due at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf at the EM @-@ Teacher in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that date , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor service in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo is the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who guides the S@@ etz@@ in@@ burg in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also re@@ minded of the EM 2013 of change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this regard , we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; declared the World Ranking List .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant .
it is a mix of great fashion show and a wax @-@ man Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) has presented an exhibition on his work at the Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display man@@ ne@@ qu@@ ins , which are terri@@ bly made thanks to video projec@@ tions .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and thus he earned men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was ble@@ aching , meanwhile it is real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle the Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is an accident that the fashion console has changed its original attitude towards a show over his person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually he had been against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition received a little bit after death , &quot; he said .
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made station in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits include an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed an apprentic@@ eship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excellent choreograph@@ ed total work of work , for which a lot of effort was used : to make the pupp@@ ets , for example , a sty@@ list has been hired .
using 14 tons of material , the makers have mol@@ ded according to the stand@@ by Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot according to the number of drivers .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was another special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers ancient ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the first , ag@@ itated mo@@ an walking attempts of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he dressed in his Teddy B@@ HS and dresses , Gaul@@ tier said .
playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
the dis@@ card of fashion he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashionable fashion manus@@ cripts and looked like the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier was told in Munich .
later I bought it , of course .
for his first fashion show he could not pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ aces top as Fashion @-@ N@@ ic
earlier it went to the long embroi@@ dery in and around Pl@@ auen &apos;s about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were produced in large amounts for customers who worked for example to ceilings and she@@ er curtains .
this alone does not work anymore , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the E@@ quest@@ om Pl@@ auen .
instead , the fashion is important again .
in the initial cycle of Pl@@ au@@ ener industry , fashion has played a greater role , was then displac@@ ed by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and with regional folk costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which bor@@ rowed from the past , re@@ jects an increasing face potential .
those who are no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
it is already half of all orders in us .
W@@ hi@@ jo@@ ys Pl@@ auen is a member of the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies together with nine other companies .
only they may carry the protected label .
over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of the turnover has been broken away .
private stores and retail stores are almost no longer available .
our products can hardly reach our customers on this path .
the mass goods are produced in Asia in the Asian region much cheaper and sold exclusively through chains .
also export of export , currently to Russia and the USA .
plenty of reasons therefore for new paths .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also attempts to score by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula farmer by the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we are leading a seal of quality that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to materials used .
a Diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at Schnee@@ berger outside of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - speci@@ alis@@ es in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
to oppos@@ e the competition from Asian countries , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
it arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories that mainly need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different to keep a customer base .
a few years ago Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ vit@@ ated the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates little cu@@ res at some places .
the Pl@@ au@@ lin Gold@@ fin@@ ie@@ de@@ master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Krau@@ se let them inspire : &quot; I couldn &apos;t do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball for her jewel@@ s .
it forms the pattern in silver in a elabor@@ ate manner .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ aces &quot; - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter said .
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors were living in ple@@ th@@ fulness and surroundings , who want to live a souvenir .

Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be stirring , but Disney also dar@@ es to make a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a sort of re @-@ film but about 20 years after the first movie with the magic children &apos;s girl . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny &apos;s experience in times of global economic crisis in England .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy has to open itself wider out@@ ward to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday a group commissioned to reform the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be used to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business establ@@ ishments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said , in an address at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promote new austerity and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ate market access , relaxation of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul the inhabitants of Mel@@ amine .
after the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance since it as@@ sists the market a greater role in the al@@ location of resources , a legal business environment marked and open the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also take control over the powers being transferred to companies and make sure that companies will decide how they manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co@@ operations and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ght@@ ful interests of foreign finance companies and bring better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , it is easier to apply for foreigners , a permanent residence permit , or the &apos; Green Card &apos; , optimi@@ zes the requirements and simpli@@ fy the application process .
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to put professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader were used as Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in a report published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and make consumers a much higher dose of nerve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Consumer Health Organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a promising working paper , critic@@ ized the plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects inf@@ alli@@ ative of industrial and environmental policies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to raise the limit values of nerve force for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ ks or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic @-@ olit@@ ical reasons &quot; from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large pre@@ dat@@ ors have already been so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury that , based on the existing limit values , approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent would be for sale .
in turn , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to reduce limit values from other fish currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch therefore described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low bur@@ dened down to the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lower@@ ing of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dential maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; says Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a heavy metal , which is highly toxic to humans in the food chain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities especially can cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of Health declar@@ es on his website with respect to the highest figures , however , that a &quot; health end@@ an@@ gering of the public population is not expected . &quot;
mercury is driven mainly by coal burning in the environment .
according to a written information by the federal state ministry , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ bo@@ ck produced more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total @-@ thirds of Germany &apos;s em@@ itted volume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish is around in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had cited the paper in March of the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , mercury in fish @-@ wide warnings came to the most common health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
