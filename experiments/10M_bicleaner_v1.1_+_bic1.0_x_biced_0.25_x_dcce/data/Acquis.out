a re@@ agent for blood @-@ group@@ ing must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , that is the antibody or another on the label indicated substance hom@@ olo@@ g .
if a re@@ agent used by the manufacturer recommended way , so may the following factors or appar@@ itions do not occur : a ) , mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by always renewed th@@ inner rec@@ agen@@ das to double re@@ agents to double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the worth @-@ pro@@ ke value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um@@ lution , in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution will be calculated exclusively of the volume of blood @-@ rep@@ uted in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carrier , the activity is expressed by the time that is necessary for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object bearer .
the world health organization has set for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood @-@ group@@ ing international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at present standards .
an international standard supplement contains according to definition a certain number of inter@@ national units per mg , or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in separate blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood @-@ group@@ ing of most specific@@ ities is expressed as Ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ alisation , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ ber@@ ation .
the title gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic image of aggreg@@ ates occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group@@ ing are available for the International Standard Reg@@ ulators ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the Tit@@ ration of the unknown re@@ agent in the international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

if a re@@ agent was stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its necessary properties should remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form noisy label is one year after the last satisfactory efficacy .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is directed after the results of the post@@ ure tests ; it is approved by the state super@@ visory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , and indeed in the glass container where they are dried and that is so closed that no moisture can inv@@ ade .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 v.@@ H. &apos;s weight if it is tested by further drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxide at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm h@@ g within 24 hours .
for the prevention of bacterial growth , the competent authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or the supplied by the dry re@@ agents delivered sol@@ vents ) an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added if the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to increase the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood @-@ group@@ ing must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nit@@ rogen per ml fluid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ um .
the re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in fluid form or after re@@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain neither sedi@@ ments nor visible particles .
the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group@@ ings should not be colored artificial , at least as long as not until a Internation@@ ales Convention has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood @-@ group@@ ings are in such ways and in such quantities to distribute that in a container re@@ agent not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative controversy .
those in a container amount must be so great that the content may be used in order to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the co @-@ operation of production has on all production levels and controls of re@@ agents to provide blood @-@ group@@ ing written records .
adequate samples of all issued re@@ agents are so long to preserve from the laboratory of laboratory until with some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood re@@ agents can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary aids to reinforce the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective lawyers in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or herbal re@@ agents do not contain any substances of human origin .
on each individual container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1st name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required fluid ,
besides this label or label on the cart@@ on , in which the individual containers are located , or that included the containers , provided the following information : 1 complete name and address of the manufacturer ,
