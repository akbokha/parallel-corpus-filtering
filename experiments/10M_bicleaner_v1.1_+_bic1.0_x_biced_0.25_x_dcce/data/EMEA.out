this document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains what the studies carried out on Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please refer to the EP@@ AR ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist .

it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets , as a solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injection resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Hum@@ res thinking and Spe@@ ak , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ anity ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of the abnormal brightness ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
A@@ bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe maneu@@ ver episodes and prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection resolution is applied to the quick control of gest@@ ant anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to one or the melt @-@ up in patients that the swal@@ lowing of tablets difficulties are being prepared .
in patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines that are built just like A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances , which enable the communication of nerve cells among each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ ist &quot; for the recep@@ tors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in less dimensions than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters works to activate the recep@@ tors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , creating psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevent their re@@ occur .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , the re @-@ emergence of symptoms , was examined in three studies over to one year .
the efficacy of the injection resolution has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were st@@ acked out over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in a further study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operative i@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that were to occur to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with at@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection resolution has been observed in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from pe@@ ac@@ om@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the variation of symptoms of patients with a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment languages were examined .
the company also led studies through to investigate how the body cover the mel@@ ting and the solution to tear ( up ) .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients showed A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients received a placebo .
in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ term studies have been more effective than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of effective than placebo the re @-@ occur manager in previously @-@ treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of aff@@ licted un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inser@@ tion ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ex@@ ath@@ ic interference ( in@@ contro@@ ll@@ ability ) , som@@ ni@@ al ( per@@ v@@ ility ) , saliva @-@ hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( increased storage production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee on Human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and of moderate @-@ heavy episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l pre@@ tend to over@@ ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s the risks .
furthermore , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection @-@ solution in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s the risks .
as of June 2004 , the European Commission issued the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole languages ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily irrespective of meals .
a increased effectiveness at me@@ tering during a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients of 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ ald@@ osis should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duction is deduc@@ ted from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ icide is part of psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and in some cases reported after the beginning or the change of an anti @-@ psycho@@ tic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased su@@ icide risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardi@@ ac disease ( m@@ yo@@ genes , excessive disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure @-@ pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) .

if at a AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ ities , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient signs signs and symptoms developed on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines must be ab@@ used , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied to patients with cr@@ amp@@ fan@@ atics in the An@@ am@@ nese or at states that are associated with caution , with caution .

however , there was one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and the speak for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ outlet or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , has been reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drug @-@ treated patients who allow for direct comparisons .
Poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels .
a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , where weight gain is observed as a side @-@ effect and could lead to severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines that is taken over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agon@@ is Fam@@ oti@@ din , an gast@@ ric blo@@ cker , reduces the resi@@ due rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , a high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( chin@@ o@@ in ) decreased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ reductions .
with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers can result in the common application with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plastic levels of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism .
if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should over@@ ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s the potential risks to the patient .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ protein , should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ reductions .
after lowering the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y on the dose @-@ height before the start of the accompanying therapy .
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentr@@ ations .
in clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day no significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ Metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an ( Rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic ) .
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
due to the inadequate data base for the safety of people and due to the resulting concerns in animal studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits are clearly justi@@ fying the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , in other anti@@ psycho@@ tic medicines , patients should be warned before , dangerous machines , including vehicles , to operate until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them .
the following side effects appear more common ( 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medic@@ ally relevant adverse reactions ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) by EPS including par@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ac@@ ath@@ ic , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ operative i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l @-@ treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes at bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under Hal@@ operative i@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks at a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ amed treatment and 15,@@ 7 % for patients treated patients .
a comparison between the patient groups among Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , revealed no medic@@ ally significant differences .
increases of the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ phosph@@ ate ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

in clinical trials and since the market launch , inci@@ dental or inten@@ tional over@@ do@@ ings were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with cher@@ ished doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis during the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that Ha@@ e@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l shows a high plastic carrier .
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder over the combination of a particip@@ le agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recep@@ tors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor and an excessive aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
in gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects , the Pos@@ it@@ et@@ ops @-@ Tom@@ ographie showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the coup .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psycho@@ tic symptoms .
in a Hal@@ operative i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 per cent of the respon@@ ds of patients who included a response to the study medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values of measurement range , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - anti @-@ scale scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of relap@@ ses , which lay at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Group and in 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ ka controlled , multinational double blind study with schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients involved and in which the primary study group &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patient a weight gain from at least 7 % compared to the output value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l a compared placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo no superior effectiveness .
in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a comparison of placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a steady effect , which was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ oper@@ i@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also pointed out a comparative share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia , such as lithium or semi@@ i@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which partially over 2 weeks do not respond to Li@@ thi@@ um or Val@@ pro@@ at Mon@@ otherapy for therapeu@@ tical efficiency in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .

based on vit@@ ro studies the enzy@@ mes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 for the stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ ction of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is responsible , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ modelling is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the middle elimination age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at extensive Met@@ abol@@ is@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and in approximately 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism about C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a haven @-@ specific evaluation of the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy proportions .
a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on pharmac@@ o@@ be@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ on@@ cology , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity , ic@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and the can@@ o@@ genic potential , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data provided no special dangers to humans .
toxic effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects split a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ dependent on rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the 3@@ - to 10@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ s of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ im dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended max@@ ald@@ osis in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of Mon@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkey ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times the recommended max@@ ald@@ osis in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of abra@@ sion was examined in a major study , participated in the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had previously received an Anth@@ rac@@ ycl@@ ine .
the effect of abra@@ sion ( in all of a gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug &apos;s conventional pack @-@ axel ( in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 with abra@@ sion patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel
looking at only patients who were treated for the first time with metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time until the deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients had received prior treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that the x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel in drugs .
it must also not be applied to patients who are breastfeeding or before the start of treatment low ne@@ ut@@ ros@@ sing figures in the blood .
the Committee on Human veterinary medicines ( CH@@ MP ) marked that the first treatment was no longer att@@ acking , more effective than conventional Pac@@ lit@@ axel and medicines , and that it must not be given in contrast to other Pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines with other medicines to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission shared the European Commission &apos; xis Bio@@ Science Limited Free approval for the in@@ traffic of abra@@ sion in the entire European Union .

the application of abra@@ sion for metastatic Mam@@ ma@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ defined studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised phase III equivalent study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma were treated with abra@@ sion , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ car@@ cin@@ oma .
this multi@@ centric study has been carried out in patients with metastatic mam@@ ma@@ cardi@@ ac , either in the form of sol@@ vent @-@ sized Pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion using any allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of abra@@ sion 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
when shooting in the study , 64 % of patients had com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al met@@ ast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ al cells .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adjuv@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ a reduction and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ ering and the adjuv@@ ant treatment .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ ference practices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ fer@@ mentation , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if before the procedure , a blood@@ shed is not possible and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a doctor that has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood@@ shed , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection may also be made by the patient or its supervis@@ ors , provided that they have received proper guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who received an chemotherapy , the h@@ mo@@ p binary should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 gram per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the Iron values of all patients are prior to treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin@@ ence or by doing so that the body does not bind sufficient to the body &apos;s body @-@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
Er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus to min@@ ate the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) that it conve@@ x to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a V@@ ene in the framework of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems , with the reference manual .
all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks long E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein before they were sent either to se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main inde@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change in the her@@ al@@ glo@@ om values between the beginning of the study and the partial period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also placed the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin has been examined by E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancers patients received chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients caused by kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glo@@ om values were reported in the same measure as for those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of a encephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) like sudden , ste@@ eping mig@@ r@@ ous headaches and confusion can lead .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
dis@@ sec@@ ts as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are needed to make sure that this is triggered by no allergic reactions .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which presents Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information about the safety of the drug , including information on the safety of the drug .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied to patients with a high fre@@ ading risk ( bone break@@ downs ) , including in patients , which have recently suffered a reduced break@@ age like in the case . • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hat@@ ton@@ ics should get a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
for the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was attracted to the assessment of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis was involved and the number of spine has been examined for three years .
the second study involved 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a boun@@ ties ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures for a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with risk of risk ( another bite ) .
main indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the salary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( a enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the output .
in the study with older women the risk of verte@@ br@@ s in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis drug ) has been reduced by placebo around 70 % over a period of three years .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medi@@ tate ) with those under placebo the risk of hat@@ s was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hat@@ s , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against zo@@ led@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients are subject to Ac@@ la@@ sta the risk of kidney disease , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides clari@@ fying material for doctors that contains Ac@@ la@@ sta in the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which explains how to apply medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects should be explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk for frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip .
the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hips ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was prescribed only by doctors who have experience in treating the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment of the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long R@@ emis@@ sive period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip , a initi@@ ald@@ osis of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 but in@@ tra or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by means of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patient with renal function ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group has been established .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar to older patients similar to younger .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 because data is missing and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because these patient population has only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing mort@@ g@@ ation is to treat the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta by sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone farming can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ escal@@ ation , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weigh@@ ed up before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental treatment with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment .
for patients who need dent@@ ures are no data available whether the interruption of the treatment with Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw region .
clinical assessment by the doctor &apos;s doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit rating .
the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by means of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al wor@@ sen was given in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PF@@ T , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; RF@@ T &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) .
very frequent ( 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted effects are listed in table 1 .
renal function @-@ compul@@ sive Zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function ( i.e. an increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ( yearly prior to administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure and a limited renal function were comparable in a clinical study with oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s patients over 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated to placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal pregnancy range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies treated patients .
all patients received supple@@ mental sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on prevention of clinical frac@@ tures and in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hat@@ s , the vitamin D mir@@ rors were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , however , the majority of patients received an Initi@@ ald@@ osis vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported via local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw sector was acci@@ dentally designed , above all in cancer patients , on Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients according to tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ es .
7 study with 7.@@ 7@@ 36 patients joined oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw sector with one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and in one with placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the case of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant mort@@ g@@ mia , can be compens@@ ated by the gift of oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glucose con@@ at .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PF@@ T ) is effective for 3 consecutive years ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women at the age of 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score points for the Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ als &lt; -@@ 2,5 with or without any sign of an existing spine .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly compared to the output value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mir@@ rors were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study increased the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the overall height and th@@ rot@@ tle than at all time points .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.5 % on the total surface and around 4.3 % at the donation .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ RF@@ T study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % at placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to once a weekly gift from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at applied to the percentage change of the Len@@ non @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison with the output value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ ck Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined by patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically , especially light @-@ heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ ck ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ s up to 3,@@ 0@@ cervi@@ x @-@ specific upper normal compared to the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proven in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain management was observed in comparison with the output value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who have been classified as Respon@@ si@@ fication at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy ) , could be recorded in an observ@@ ance phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at of patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach was able to sustain with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with risk @-@ monitoring patients , are maintained at a mid term of the after@@ math phase of 18 months after application .

an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Zo@@ led@@ ron@@ re@@ - concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation against Time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of through cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme metabolic substances is unlikely , because zo@@ led@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed and because they are a watch@@ ful or no direct and / or irre@@ versi@@ bly , metabolic dependence of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -

it arises that a light ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate renal function up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since for heavy kidney @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ tro Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data is available , there are no statements possible for this population .

Zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub @-@ class class , which is called Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly estrogen , which are formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
with the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get is done by bone cultivation too fast , and new bone material is sub@@ ordin@@ ated , which makes bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta affects the bone building again norm@@ alized , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone strength again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
for applying Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff if you use other medicines / apply or have recently been taken / used even if it is not prescription drug .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine from which it is known that they abuse the kidneys .
in application of Ac@@ la@@ sta , along with food and drinks you are worried that you may take enough fluid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered from your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
if you have recently broken down the hip , is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip .
mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered from your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions exact so that the calcium mir@@ rors in your blood will not be too low in your blood after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work longer than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need another treatment .
if the administration was missed by Ac@@ la@@ sta , Set@@ ting you immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date .
before completion of the therapy with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the end of the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your nearest doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side @-@ effects associated with the first in@@ fusion appear very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , are less common after the following in@@ fusion .
fever and bulk soli@@ ds , muscle or joint pain and head@@ ache , occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you &apos;ve received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , Nes@@ sel@@ aus@@ schlag and angi@@ o@@ ö@@ dem ( such as swelling in the face , the tongue or in the throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or the nursing staff , if any of the listed side effects you significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this usage information .
if the drug is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C will not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently low @-@ traumati@@ zing hip visual correction is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hips .
before and after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients need sufficient support to be supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of zo@@ di@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone farming can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ mia , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently low @-@ traumati@@ zed hip visual correction is recommended a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 but in@@ tra or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Appe@@ al report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee on Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) investig@@ ates the studies carried out on recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ tate ) can be applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ al System ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it may additionally be applied to Met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that cannot be satisfac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ try @-@ fuel or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ try and ins@@ ulin can be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ chlor@@ ine and ins@@ ulin .
this means that the body &apos;s body can be better utilis@@ able and the blood sugar level is declin@@ ing , whereby type 2 @-@ 2 diabetes can be set .
for more than 1 400 patients , the effectiveness of Ac@@ tos were examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; thereby patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ try fuel , in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which makes the blood sugar lo@@ wered by using the doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ iller in lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional fee of placebo resulted in lowering of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and ins@@ ulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , the patient which took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patient which took place additionally .
the most common side @-@ effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to irrit@@ ate ) .
Ac@@ tos must neither be applied to patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ outlet ( high ket@@ one mirror - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
in October 2000 , the European Commission shared the European Commission Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited requires permission to negotiate accounts in the entire European Union .
the tablets are white until white , round , mer@@ ging and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; page .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is dis@@ infected with ins@@ ulin and in which Met@@ forming are in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility . ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
no data is available for the use of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dose @-@ wise dose .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of in@@ suff@@ iciency , weigh@@ ting or estrogen , particularly those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve .
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of in@@ suff@@ iciency , weigh@@ ting and oils , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is applied in combination with ins@@ ulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced micro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
in this study , an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased risk of liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on can not be used .
if the AL@@ T @-@ Spiegel are raised up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the standard area , liver enz@@ ym@@ ous values are as soon as possible to control .
if a patient symptoms developed that point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , torso , fatigue , loss and / or darker har@@ n , are the liver enz@@ ym@@ ous values to review .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , it should be run by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has been proven a dose @-@ dependent weight gain , which can stir up fatty deposits , and in some cases involving fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a her@@ edi@@ lution , under the therapy with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on a minor reduction in the middle h@@ mo@@ glo@@ om values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in um 3 @-@ 4 % ) and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ ins by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a result of increased ins@@ ulin sensitivity to patients , the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on as oral or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ try therapy or as a branch @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch of the market , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ o@@ de@@ ms reported with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report on dis@@ ruption of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic statement should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable events concerning bone bro@@ ods from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one
the calculated fac@@ cture incidence was 1.@@ 9 fac@@ tions per 100 patient @-@ years with the Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 fac@@ tions per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a compar@@ atively medication .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 Fra@@ tions per 100 patient @-@ years ) , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years ) were treated with patients with a compar@@ atively medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires or occurs , treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ano@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ ities .
interactions with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ as@@ former are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the case of treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ishes in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the womb and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ low@@ ly growth .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; 1 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single incidents : unknown ( from this data not invaluable ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the boards of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ attacks above the Tri@@ ple of the standard range also frequently occurs under placebo , but more rarely than in comparative @-@ groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ um .
in a Out@@ come study with patients with existing advanced mi@@ ast@@ cular disease , the frequency of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency was under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than under placebo if Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or w .
since the market launch , it has been reported rarely through Her@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suff@@ iciency in An@@ am@@ nese .
there was a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable events related to bone bro@@ ods from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with compar@@ atively drug @-@ treated groups .
during a period of 3.5 years of ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparative study .
in taking the top dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day above seven days occurred no symptoms .
Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on seems to work on an activation of specific nuclear recipes ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) , which leads in the animal model to an increased ins@@ ulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the retro@@ fitting of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control could be maintained ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on at 69 % of the patients treated ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trial of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was dis@@ continued despite three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c is reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued to only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin in the group treated with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on &apos;s group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on showed a statisti@@ cally significant withdrawal of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Kre@@ at@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 weeks written by type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels .

compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide have been observed .
in a study of 20 weeks Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide levels , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide levels , this covers an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and the hepati@@ c tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardi@@ ac out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced micro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups random@@ ized which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one or placebo .
according to oral applications , Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on is quickly resor@@ ted , whereby the top concentr@@ ations can be reached to un@@ changing Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in the plasma generally 2 hours after application .
based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal pronounced .
in Inter@@ aktions@@ Studies could be proven that Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ano@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ ities .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on with Gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 in@@ duction ) or lowers the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active marked Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on in humans the mar@@ ker was mainly found in fec@@ es ( 55 % ) and to a lower scale in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the middle @-@ elimination elimination time of un@@ altered Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ one is about 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the entire active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy proportions , whereby the rates of the or@@ al Clear@@ ance of the parent substance is similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies performed on mice , rats , dogs and monkeys @-@ tuning after repeated administration with ha@@ modi@@ fying , ana@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardi@@ ac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ og@@ lit@@ az@@ on , which dimin@@ ishes in the form of hyper@@ ins@@ ulin an@@ emia and increased ins@@ ulin resistance to the parent and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for f@@ low@@ ly growth .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was evaluated in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as does not produce ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use ins@@ ulin .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) is measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human@@ ulin .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , doses from Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e over@@ ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ s the benefits of diabetes in relation to the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the European Commission of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed ins@@ ulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection pin must be loaded at least 6 seconds long under the skin to make sure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar has improved considerably , for example , through a intensified ins@@ ulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , ins@@ ulin ( rapidly acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic , long acting ins@@ ulin ( animal ulin , Human@@ ins@@ ulin or Insul@@ in@@ an@@ alog@@ on ) and / or manufacturer method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against ins@@ ulin origin ) can lead to that a change in dosage is required .
if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e is required in the patient a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary during the first weeks or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous ins@@ ulin .
travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to solic@@ it the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be taken or taken to other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always ask for its patients to be taken by other medicines .

the effect begins within half an hour , the drug is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire length of time is up to 24 hours .
Res@@ or@@ ption The Res@@ or@@ phic profile is due to the product that it is a mixture of ins@@ ulin products with faster or low @-@ delay res@@ or@@ ption .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive to ins@@ ulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
furthermore , doses from Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the European Commission of Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for approval for the in@@ traffic of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of ins@@ ulin are mixed , first the amount of ins@@ ulin must be raised , then the amount of the long @-@ going ins@@ ulin .
3 If switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id requires a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary during the first weeks or in the first weeks or months after conversion .
travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to solic@@ it the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be taken or taken to other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care station for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients demonstrated that one by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id induced Nor@@ mo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar 4,@@ 4 - 6,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.@@ 6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the drug is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and young people The pharmac@@ oc@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and teen@@ ager ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and young people similar to adults is similar .

if the ur@@ inary tract from two to four weeks is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased once a day of 120 mg .
during the first treatment months , there may still occur disputes occur ; therefore , that patients take at least during the first six months under treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic further medicines to contrac@@ eption of g@@ ating cases .
the drug is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients participating , the effectiveness of several aden@@ ur@@ ic @-@ doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to that of a placebo ( hypo@@ medi@@ tate ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses were compared to Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) a year for 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary tract can be seen in the blood within the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patient , the aden@@ ur@@ ic recorded at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patient , which once daily earned 120 mg in the last three measurements a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was in 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with cardi@@ ac cardi@@ ac disease may also be a heigh@@ tened risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the lowering of the ur@@ inary tract in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

7 Off@@ ene @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the treatment studies reported during the long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all Feb@@ u@@ aries stat@@ - treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long@@ time extensions studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to them occasionally on .
the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in the Pi@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two Pi@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and fact study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary effic@@ ien@@ cies was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three monthly particular ser@@ um bricks &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serv@@ at@@ in@@ wert to study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superiority in terms of treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the fact @-@ study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superiority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with conventional used dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of the ser@@ um sa@@ ils at &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in week 2 and maintained permanently across the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um cancer &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functions The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function .
an AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy approval at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient .
there was no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration in subjects , irrespective of their renal function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ser@@ um per@@ v@@ entri@@ c concentr@@ ations were taken about 10 mg / d@@ l about 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ E and fact @-@ study ) had a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration of about 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years during the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um bricks amoun@@ ted to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a g@@ loss treatment ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ loss ) .
this was associated with a reduction of the shift hub , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the periods up to month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in healthy issues the maximum plasma @-@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma @-@ centric time ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to administration is easier and multi@@ tu@@ ally doses from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportionate increase .
after taking a simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2,8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage drop in ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid concentration , provided that this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volumes ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at lies in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the Plas@@ tic connector of Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration of concentration , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg , constant .
in vit@@ ro studies at human liver cir@@ c@@ ros@@ omes showed that these oxid@@ ative metaph@@ ors are primarily formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ u@@ xo@@ stat@@ e@@ cur@@ on@@ id mainly emerges by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .

special patient groups kidney failure after taking multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to proportion with normal renal function .
the middle total AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at rose by approximately the 1.8 @-@ fold from 7.5 μ g to h / ml in the group with normal renal function to 13.@@ 2 μ g , h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specialized Pur@@ in@@ metabolic isation and urine composition and is not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it was determined that Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ alen doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day does not have an effect on the fertility and re@@ production of male and female rats .
in high doses , approximately with 4.@@ 3@@ - times of human therapeutic exposure , maternal toxicity came up , which went along with lowering the performance output and a develop@@ mental delay in the descendants of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies at tra@@ vers@@ had@@ owing sp@@ ouses with ex@@ positions which contributed around the 4,@@ 3 @-@ fold and with carrying bits with ex@@ positions that contributed around the 13 @-@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , there were no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE will be used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are bro@@ ch@@ ig ) in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for low vitamin D mir@@ rors .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or inser@@ tion of other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and Vit@@ amine complementary ) .
in order to avoid irritation of food @-@ tube , the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE in relation to increasing the vitamin D reflection .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mir@@ rors were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) .
the company also placed data prior to which the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE contained Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ ats ( muscle , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system , spec@@ ulators ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ al ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , chi@@ pped abdom@@ en ( born stomach ) as well as su@@ ction to rep@@ el .
in patients with et@@ orph@@ ous hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at , vitamin D@@ 3 or one of the other components may not be applied AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
it must not be applied in disease cases , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who are not able to stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or inser@@ tion of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and Vit@@ amine additional supplements ) for the day .
following references are precisely to follow to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE shall be swal@@ lowed after the standing of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not cr@@ ush the tablet or tablet in the mouth . • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are only given under special care ( see section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ ches , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partial , these severe and required a hosp@@ it@@ ative instruction ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all the signs and symptoms that may point out to possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , and the patients should be pointed out , in the appearance of symptoms of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , pain in the swal@@ lowing or retro@@ mortal pain or new or lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ cks burn the medicine to pick and consult medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of heavy mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the drug properly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that may point to a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all faculty instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
during large clinical trials with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no higher risk has been determined , rarely ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some serious and with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose from the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose regim@@ en contains predominantly intraven@@ ously , Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to give the indications of whether the de@@ mining of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ ids of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the patients should be instructed to take them during om@@ is@@ able taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE to take the tablet next morning after they have noticed its failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the week@@ day .
other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE .
aler@@ ting foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicine can interfere with the Res@@ or@@ ption from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific Inter@@ action studies were not conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without a clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ ANCE is only intended for use at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ als women and is therefore neither during pregnancy nor by nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of directly harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose from the jaw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis .

ins@@ cription referred to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average or@@ ale Bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting and two hours before starting a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability accepted according to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
in Oste@@ opor@@ t@@ estu@@ di@@ ums Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drinking of the day .
in healthy issues , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( increase in the area of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies to rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate is distributed according to intraven@@ ous gift of 1 mg / kg temporarily into soften@@ er , but then quickly re@@ distributed in the bones or eliminated with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at have been eliminated about 50 % of radio@@ active substance in 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the subjects .
after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg , the renal clearing of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance rose not 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not eliminated by rats or bas@@ ic transport system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that people affected the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

characteristic in patients of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at who is not depos@@ ited in the bone , quickly via urine .
although no clinical data is available above , it is nonetheless expected that the renal elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as in the animal try to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function to expect a slightly increased grief from Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at in the bone ( see Section 4.2 ) .

Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is administered to adult patients having a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent an out@@ pouring of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .

due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transp@@ onder or an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub @-@ or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sion .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or the regime should only be done under the tigh@@ tening control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
in consequence of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of contrac@@ tion and toler@@ ability in single case and on blood levels . ( see &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations &quot; Recommen@@ d@@ ations

metic@@ ulous and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure to the immediate re@@ traction phase .

further dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations can be later necessary since the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation prophy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ ant treatment should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily routine in the morning .
dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f must be revers@@ ed a transp@@ osing of twice daily dosage of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f so this shift has in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose .

patients with reduced kidney function Da renal function has no effect on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serv@@ at@@ in@@ levels ) is recommended , a calculation of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ( and a monitoring of the ureth@@ ane ) .

recommendations for the valley mirror in full bl@@ ut Die dose should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under the aid of full @-@ bl@@ ut tac@@ t@@ li@@ mus test controls .
it is recommended to perform common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .

since Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the valley levels in the blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m lie in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and when used - and sal@@ ted patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent revival therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts have generally been used in blood concentr@@ ations in the area of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events , including transp@@ l@@ asses , or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modifications of the formulation or the regime should only be done under the tigh@@ tening control of an experienced physician ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .

at the prophy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ onder at adult heart transplan@@ ts and transp@@ onder@@ s at child age , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
because of possible interactions formed to a lowering of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other plant healing during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f to avoid ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscles concentr@@ ates on blood as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , one described as a cardi@@ om@@ yo@@ path@@ ia chamber or Sep@@ tum@@ our hyper@@ trop@@ ic , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clin@@ ically distur@@ ban@@ ces are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid pollution and estrogen .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be reduced due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection by means of a high protection factor .
if patients who occupy Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for pris@@ als such as head@@ ache , changed state of consciousness , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ muscles - blood levels at equivalent amount of substances , which can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain equal concentr@@ ations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .

pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the elevated oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the im@@ itation of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal metabolism , results .
high @-@ do@@ si@@ fied Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ prec@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on as it is used in acute action @-@ actions can increase or reduce the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m in the blood .

factors such as low tick @-@ value and low prot@@ ein@@ ous concentr@@ ations leading to an increase in the un@@ found fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a result of treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids bring about the metabolic enhancement of the metabolic diseases intended to be responsible for the transp@@ l@@ ant monitoring of the higher clearing rates .

Adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII related , inn@@ ate blood @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of application will address whether Adv@@ ate is applied to treat bleeding or to the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles , or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but based on a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) , which it conve@@ ys the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is a different approved drug approved in the European Union , but is otherwise manufactured , so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human and animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate Hä@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood @-@ sep@@ tum with &apos; excellent &apos; and &apos; good &apos; .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ ache , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components .
in March 2004 , the European Commission shared the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approval for approval in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitu@@ tions are directed after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the place and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following case , the factor VIII activity is expected to sink the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period of time ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute draw@@ backs are eliminated .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger to the patient is over .
during the treatment process , the dose of the injections of the injections and incidence of injections is to have an adequate provision of the factor VIII @-@ plastic .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis T@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be doses between 20 and 40 , i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activities will not be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a proper dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so others need therapeutic interventions to be weigh@@ ed .
the administration @-@ speed is to be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ sive activity of factor VIII framed Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure and an@@ am@@ nesty development , after conversion of a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ operation of ( low @-@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare appearance of the Hä@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding .
the number of patients in the number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which were all raised in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( from 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data may not be invaluable ) .

blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirror in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post @-@ operative day .

moreover , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate Hä@@ m@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( 0 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of a current clinical study formed 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE , patients infected inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ lifting as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise , however , occurred no signs or symptoms that have been shown to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ bites reported in several repeated product positions within the study .

based on the data available since the first appro@@ vals of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP needs to be reviewed as a positive , but considering that the security profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
hence the CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the Security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s all 6 months , decided that the applicant should apply another renewal procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mole@@ cular Limited awarded the Committee on Human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company will withdraw its application for approval for the in@@ er@@ ation of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft@@ ness ( tissue , the other structures in the body connects , surrounds and bases ) of it .
this is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically that it may carry out a gene in the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it has changed so that there is no copies of themselves and thus no infections in humans can trigger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is generated from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body of existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene , usually contributes to the restoration of corrupt DNA and to the killing of cells when the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , at which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene def@@ ective is , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company placed data from a study involving a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the realm of construction , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP tried the answers of the company on the questions asked questions , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial documents the CH@@ MP sent on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP opinion , the injection was not proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will take advantage of the patient .
the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company had not proven enough that Adv@@ ent can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company won &apos;t notice the CH@@ MP whether the return consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ um@@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled , that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other will start slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len caused by inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways in patients with nas@@ al sli@@ mming nose ) .
in adults and adolescents from 12 years old , the recommended dose of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be termin@@ ated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be rel@@ ayed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective per@@ sever@@ ance were the changes of the sever@@ ity of hypo@@ cris@@ y symptoms which were reported from the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
during the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported the aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient who accepted Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % to the patient who captured the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are tick @-@ dry , di@@ om@@ ot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( throat infection ) , anal disease , fatigue , fatigue , In@@ som@@ nie ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sle@@ ep@@ tive and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may possibly over@@ flow ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseudo @-@ ep@@ he@@ in or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gic agents or lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( another medicine for treating allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from an angle glau@@ coma ( increased eye pressure ) , coron@@ ary or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ roid ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ roid ( hyper@@ blood circulation ) , or have a risk for a sham@@ anic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission of the SP SP provided an approval for the in@@ traffic of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to dis@@ guise or che@@ wing ) .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be applied due to the lack of data to un@@ thin@@ kable and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not being applied to children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued .
it is recommended to limit the application duration for 10 days , since when long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in can take time off .
after the decline of the swelling of the mu@@ st@@ skins in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment may be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ conduc@@ tors , Per@@ go@@ lid , cab@@ al light , cab@@ al im@@ it@@ amin , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ lep@@ hr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ac@@ oline , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collectively and the data are not enough to pronoun@@ ce relevant recommendations on the dosage .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze have not been reviewed by patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to pronoun@@ ce relevant recommendations on the dosage .
patients need to be informed that treatment at the appearance of hyper@@ tension or ty@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ es or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a strengthening of headaches ) must be deduc@@ ted .
in the treatment of the following patients , patients get advised : • patients under digital rhythm • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , blis@@ ters , or bron@@ ch@@ pas@@ m in An@@ am@@ nesty .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying out a mat@@ ological test , as anti@@ hist@@ amine is otherwise able to prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin @-@ actions or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the results of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ory tests , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and those treated with placebo irrespective of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ mes has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the un@@ thin@@ kable of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences of a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency at the normal population .
since Re@@ production studies on animals do not always be transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ cal properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in should Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated that in very rare cases , it may come to a ben@@ om@@ arity , which can lead to impairment or ability to operate machines .
symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , coma , cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( ins@@ om@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ als .
headaches , anxiety , scar@@ ed micro@@ tion , muscle weakness , arousal , arousal , arousal , arousal , aspir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , ar@@ di@@ mental pain , t@@ innitus , axi@@ om , se@@ ar@@ tery and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children as well as A@@ w@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ ths , pe@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigi@@ dity and - D@@ il@@ at@@ ation , Hau@@ tr@@ ö@@ ment , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ found@@ ational cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expres@@ sion@@ ist smo@@ ker @-@ sel@@ ector on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks connected to flying .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg , no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness was found in comparison to placebo .
the or@@ ale application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in in the recommended dosage can produce more person@@ om@@ im@@ e@@ tic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal .
it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nas@@ al rotation swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in on the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect , determined by the nose @-@ skin swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin groups .
as part of a single dose study for the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical study of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is detec@@ table within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ alen application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with healthy inter@@ ban@@ den over 14 days the fly @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ als reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ disciplinary study , which has been carried out with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects , has been determined that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in poorly poll@@ uted .
a component interaction study reveals that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ it was equivalent to exposure to gift of a Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ on@@ cology , at the toxicity of repeti@@ tive gift , for Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and to re@@ producing sto@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine however does not recognize any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in .
in repe@@ al x@@ ic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ in was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ genic .

A@@ ster@@ us was conducted in total eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ chin@@ ess , number and size of the p@@ addle , impairment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment .
there were further studies submitted to em@@ ulate that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melt @-@ up in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ ster@@ us led to an average withdrawal of the symptom ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patient which received a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of a symptom is based on six @-@ week treatment with A@@ ster@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % with placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine or any of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission of the SP @-@ Europe appointed a licence for the in@@ traffic of A@@ ster@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ving the symptoms at allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness in applying des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine to young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ acting allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease process and may be termin@@ ated after the end of the symptoms and res@@ umed its re@@ occur .
in the pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms in 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during everyday life @-@ time treatment .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the effective effect of alcohol was not reinforced during the current intake of A@@ ster@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated that it can occur in very rare cases , which can lead to impairment or ability to operate machines .
for clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ster@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently asked side @-@ effects reported on which reported more frequently than in placebo were fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0,@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical trial conducted with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side @-@ effect head@@ ache , this occurred at 5.5 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and treated with 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ found@@ ational cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the im@@ itation of the expression of the adhesive mode @-@ sel@@ ectiv@@ tin on endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
within the framework of a clinical study involving multi @-@ expert in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dosage of 45 mg every day ( the ne@@ un@@ easy of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .
with an individual dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening of subjective pun@@ ctu@@ ality or the tasks connected to flying .
in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ ster@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ chin@@ ess of the nose , it@@ chin@@ ess , cad@@ ence and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ chin@@ ess on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into dependence on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and pers@@ isting allergic rhin@@ itis .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as in the total number of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ ti@@ tis was shown , dimin@@ ished A@@ ster@@ us effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was advoc@@ ating for further forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ological path@@ ology irrespective of the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be processed easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since the hist@@ amine is a significant factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also caused by other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ ster@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ addle at the end of the first dose @-@ inter@@ v@@ alls .

an improvement in the qui@@ ver around more than 50 % was observed by 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated to placebo .
the treatment with A@@ ster@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and growth , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to assess these variables .
in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ Pop@@ ulation , in 4 % of patients had reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
however , the enzyme responsible for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzy@@ mes has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines will not be excluded completely .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of P @-@ Gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) does not apply to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the clinical studies performed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , with a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxic@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ on@@ cology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and to re@@ producing sto@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has no special threats to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relie@@ ving the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis are caused by infection in children under 2 years ( see under Section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available to support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ al@@ ies , in the diagnosis the An@@ am@@ n@@ ics , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metaboli@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine limited and learn a higher sub@@ strate ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ ster@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which restri@@ cts restricted , is identical to those in children who metabol@@ ise normal .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions have not been observed in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , at the same intake of A@@ ster@@ us tablets and alcohol , the high @-@ performance effect of alcohol is not reinforced ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ ster@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ ster@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ disciplinary study of adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) were given , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .

because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ an@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine can be ap@@ oli@@ ed in adults to the children &apos;s population extr@@ ap@@ oli@@ tic .
within the framework of a clinical study involving multi @-@ specialist in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of up to 20 mg every day , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects were described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in a dosage of 45 mg every day ( the ne@@ h of clinical dose ) has been applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c intervals .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s Vacc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. on the Committee on Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed that the company adop@@ ts its application for approval for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to adults and older people to protect flu that is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine being caused in front of a strain of influenza that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new tribe of influenza occurs , which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the immune system contained in the vaccine as a &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
by doing so , the immune system is later able to form in a contact with a prevention of influenza this pedi@@ gree .
then the membrane @-@ envelope of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body is dis@@ missed as body alien ) , pur@@ ified and used as a component of the vaccine .
one inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the E@@ MEA &apos;s guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines .
if you need to participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor doctor .
for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ idal anti @-@ virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired Immun@@ e De@@ fic@@ iency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , acts as a solution to deposit , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti @-@ viral medicines has been taken before , and the likelihood is judged that the virus will appeal to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which will be taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS cannot cure , however , may delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti @-@ viral medicines , however without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously had not been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ia .
this with low do@@ osing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken from protein eas@@ ed , with other protein eas@@ es .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no detec@@ table concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( virus last ) or the change of viral infections after the treatment .
in studies with patients who previously had no protein eas@@ ed , had no more patients under A@@ generative more patients under 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children decreased A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ al last , however , with the children who had previously been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ia , were only very few on the treatment languages .
in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ia , that was treated with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the Vir@@ al last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other protein eas@@ ed :
in the patient with HIV , which was resistant to four other protein eas@@ ed , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ al last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protein eas@@ ed :
the most common side effects of A@@ generic ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blowing ) , vom@@ iting ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients who are cur@@ rants ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are as common as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentr@@ ations in blood health harmful .
as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ generic ystro@@ phy ( change in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ tic ( re@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection that are caused by the rest@@ ling immune system ) .
the Committee on Human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to over@@ weigh HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r but the committee determined that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no protein eas@@ ed , is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , there was limited information only .
in October 2000 , the European Commission adopted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Limited with an approval for the transport of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ab@@ mer ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
for usual A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ths of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance and the treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than in am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying add @-@ on of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ erung ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily intake of 2400 mg am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other protein eas@@ es have not been studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to un@@ thin@@ kable and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to take care of patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also include sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , may not be applied due to the risk reduction of plasma @-@ concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination .
usually A@@ generic capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk to severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of these medicines .
patients with existing limited liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids that switches over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ res@@ sion of ad@@ renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ er Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin depends heavily on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ clic antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the substance concentration .
for patients who take these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plas@@ cos@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there is also even low doses administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high pro@@ bio@@ tic drug content of the A@@ generic solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set for duration 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including protein eas@@ ab@@ mer , has been reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ams of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , to whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in case of m@@ oph@@ ile patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with Prot@@ eas@@ es , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ ters and ha@@ mar@@ thro@@ es .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective therapy , at the time of the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual infections develop which leads to severe clinical states or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immune @-@ size index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose , in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) reports .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also include sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ mas@@ gel with he@@ avier and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a balance development .
in trying to compens@@ ate the harv@@ ested plastic mask by a dose increase of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often unwanted effects on liver have been observed .
Johann@@ is@@ wee@@ ds ( Hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) The service level of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r can be degra@@ ded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rants ( hyper@@ icum per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient has already adop@@ ts tor@@ ch , the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror is and , if possible to check the Vir@@ al last and dis@@ miss the cur@@ rants .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when clo@@ se@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max on it by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
in clinical trials , doses were applied twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily and k@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % humili@@ ating when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) can be reached approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered .
a dos@@ ages recommended for simultaneous administration of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring because the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ ess of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Did@@ an@@ os@@ in combination , but is recommended due to the anta@@ sia component of Did@@ an@@ os@@ in , that the income of Did@@ an@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , at the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z , in combination with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein eas@@ iness would be degra@@ ding .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ iness and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in may lowers ser@@ um concentration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased / possibly sub@@ therapeutic masculine .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is commanded ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous gift of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin um 193 % and thus to an increase in with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin connected side effects .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , along with A@@ gener@@ ase to ad@@ minister , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half the recommended dose , though no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted , however , the plas@@ mas@@ gel of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma on 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 points ) to $ 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day with no simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other protein eas@@ iness , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase because it can come to resi@@ due disorder .
the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va , known as en@@ cyclo@@ duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium can@@ als , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by amp@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can enhance their plasma @-@ centr@@ ations and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significant , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended together with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ants such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the increases of plas@@ mas@@ ons are expected to be expected while receiving A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plastic increases this H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to m@@ yo@@ path@@ ia including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r .
it will be recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , as the plasma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by con@@ glomer@@ ation of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
data on simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other protein eas@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plas@@ mas@@ ons of Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ iat@@ ric symptoms , especially if there is also even low doses administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the per se small reliability of historical comparisons , there is currently no recommendation to be given as the spec@@ kled dose is to suit when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ on .
with current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not pres@@ et@@ able , therefore as well as alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ clic antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful abor@@ tion of possible usage for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk @-@ activated rats , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , however , it is not known whether am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r is over@@ flowing with humans into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ production study of rep@@ ain@@ ly rats , which was administered from the inti@@ mid@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breastfeeding period of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the after@@ no@@ bility .
the further development of the descendants including fer@@ til@@ ability and reproductive capacity was not affected by the submission of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r to the mother tier .
the un@@ thin@@ ess of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the associated side @-@ effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ related side effects were slightly to moderate , occurred early and resulted in a rare treatment regim@@ en .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or other medicines applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the listed side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ eas@@ ed patients received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were developed by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study medication and were performed with more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are performed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy has been associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) with HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and fa@@ un@@ al fat tissues , increased intra@@ operative and vis@@ cer@@ al fatty tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ y fat collection ( embro@@ ider@@ ies ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ , not pre @-@ treated individuals who were treated with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine on a medium duration of 36 weeks was only observed ( breastfeeding ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients under am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) with 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is for a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin balances were usually slightly slightly shaped , er@@ y@@ them@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ly nature , with or without it@@ chin@@ ess and occurred usually during the second treatment week , and disappeared spontane@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r .
cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose has been reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune def@@ ective therapy , at the time of the introduction of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual infections develop ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ing concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts 0,@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the im@@ itation of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ ulative patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ do@@ ings were - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ ed treatment schem@@ as with protein eas@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ than treated patients , the 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study of 100@@ 7@@ 32 appeared , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure to be tested up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates were otyp@@ ically examined .
a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure did not exist within the 59 , with prot@@ eas@@ ed cases did not occurred , showed resistance patterns , which were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ically reported about 96 weeks , the following Prot@@ eas@@ ed mut@@ ations on :
at the otyp@@ ic resistance @-@ based analyses of man@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be applied to the assessment of the activity of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ab@@ mer res@@ istent isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / F / C / C / C / C / V , I@@ 6@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 4@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , I@@ 4@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a decreased probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical contact ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
at Phen@@ otyp@@ ical Res@@ tis@@ ation based analyses Clinical phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ab@@ mer res@@ istent isol@@ ates .
companies , the diagnostic entry tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ Phen@@ otyp@@ ic Cut @-@ offs ( separ@@ ators ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a balance tests .
each of these four with a decreased sensi@@ tiveness against am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but generally preserved .
there are currently data for cru@@ res@@ sion between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other protein eas@@ es for all 4 Fos@@ spec@@ kled resistance , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tro@@ scopy ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ viol@@ avi@@ r / k@@ z@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 4 out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ est@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ed @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early release of an overwhelming therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment properly .
the test@@ ament of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cle@@ osi@@ dan@@ a ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ d@@ osing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; received .
one hundred and sixty @-@ six ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A by PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ under@@ mine of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group with regard to the time period ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ al last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ lower threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ generative resolution has been evaluated three times a day , 20 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby most of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ re Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r simultaneously ; the majority of those treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Basi@@ cs of this data should be considered in the treatment optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children who will be considered to be expected to be expected by &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum service concentration of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 @-@ 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max against 30 % reduced , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the administration of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction in AU@@ C , but has no effect on concentration of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained in@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influenced the scale and rate of Res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation in the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in plasma , with the amount of un@@ matched am@@ ag@@ ion , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ matched am@@ est@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active ingredients during the do@@ zation inter@@ v@@ alls in dependence on the overall medication @-@ centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines to indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or make inhibit@@ ing or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generative ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily ag@@ ion avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
spec@@ kled is less bio@@ compatible from the solution of 14 % than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ generic capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams .
it is also neg@@ li@@ gible for the renal clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , therefore the impact of a renal function is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ plastic , comparable to those that are achieved at healthy pro@@ ban@@ den after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on can@@ cer@@ y with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in males &apos;s en@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ o@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome at doses , which spoke to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to the people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ est@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ative ome atoms and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genius tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel @-@ test of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes contained , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
these liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
up to now , clinical studies have not been observed yet any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of the treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both the control and the spec@@ kled animals treated with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals .
in a systemic plasma exposure , which was significant under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure to human subjects , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which point to a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying add @-@ on of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ st@@ erung ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily intake of 2400 mg am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with relap@@ se or mild liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ clic antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set out at duration 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk for a le@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in has caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a balance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max on it by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg L@@ opin@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) can be reached approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered .
a dos@@ ages recommended for simultaneous administration of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra cannot be given , however , it is recommended to be a eng@@ masch@@ ige monitoring because the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ ess of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both protein eas@@ iness would be degra@@ ding .
if these medicines are applied together , caution is commanded ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin , along with A@@ gener@@ ase to ad@@ minister , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half the recommended dose 31 at least , though no clinical data is available .
the ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium can@@ als , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r , which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ prop@@ ion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den have been significant , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with current gift of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,@@ 0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % in charge .
during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used after careful abor@@ tion of possible usage for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ production study of rep@@ ain@@ ly rats , which was administered from the inti@@ mid@@ ation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breastfeeding period of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the breastfeeding period .
the un@@ thin@@ ess of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient is based on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , the necessary support measures are needed .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as also peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ ing concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts 0,@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ est@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ed @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data should be considered in the treatment optimization with PI pre @-@ treated children who are considered to be expected to be expected by &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ matched am@@ est@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active ingredients during the do@@ zation inter@@ v@@ alls in dependence on the overall medication @-@ centr@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State over the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines to indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or make inhibit@@ ing or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ generative ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
it is also neg@@ li@@ gible for the renal clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ; therefore the impact of a renal function is likely to be low on the elimination of am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ cer@@ y with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in males &apos;s en@@ ig@@ ne he@@ pat@@ o@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome at doses , which spoke to the 2.0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily rout@@ ing of 1200 mg am@@ est@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ oc@@ ele aden@@ atoms and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ genius tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations test ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse ly@@ mph@@ atic test of human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ iny nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed both the control and the spec@@ kled animals treated with am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals .
these findings suggest that in juven@@ iles the met@@ aboli@@ c paths are not yet fully mature , so am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ generic solution for inser@@ tion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ab@@ mer ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
the benefits of with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion has not been treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor by PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r as a solution to inser@@ tion is 14 % lower than in am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the patients should as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to deposit ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase resolution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily intake of 2@@ 800 mg am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
additionally , there must be no dosage recommendations for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for in@@ gestion and low do@@ osing Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided by these patients .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ ag@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for mandatory , is an application of A@@ generic solution to involve patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of an toxic response as a result of high prop@@ y@@ ance levels , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is to take for small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a compens@@ ative im@@ itation of the metabolic isation of these medicines and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ clic antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Standards @-@ rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the substance concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk for a le@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 independent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .

the application forms and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dara depends on the treating disease : • In case of co@@ war@@ ps in the genital area , the cream is open for six weeks to a maximum of 16 weeks . • In acute ker@@ at@@ osis it is available during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly .
the cream is before bed@@ time thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected skin surfaces so that they remain enough for a long time ( about 8 hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area at 16 weeks .
the main inde@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients treated with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small basic cell cell cancer in two studies where patients were treated six weeks or transferred to placebo or placebo every day or five times a week .
main indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara has also been tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area the complete healing rate was combined with placebo @-@ treated patients , but only 3 % up to 18 % in patients treated with Al@@ dara patients treated with Al@@ dara patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

a break in the above treatment course should be weigh@@ ed when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or if a infection is observed in the treatment area .
if follow up @-@ up study 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the actual les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
when a dose was left , the patient should wear the cream once he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapeutic plan .

the available data about the ak@@ e@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose to the under@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application form , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin @-@ reactions appear frequently , but these reactions usually take over the course of therapy in intensity or go back after consuming the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local skin @-@ reactions to the patient can cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for several days .
from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 actors take a lesser complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .

in the study the safety of the drug was examined , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( in case of its effect on reducing gene concentr@@ ations in urine and with respect to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children reported a normal major liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , ar@@ thro@@ path@@ ia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side @-@ effects in patients under five years of increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen deficiency ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ es ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and bulk soli@@ ds .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients that may possibly be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not applied .
the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) , every year , all new information that may possibly be known , examine and update this summary required .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is obtained patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
June 2003 , the European Commission adopted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for approval for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ ster ) .
aler@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative to the long @-@ term enzy@@ mes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ots I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the condition ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps up on a max@@ im dose of 43 E / kg / h increases .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no faculty scheme can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined and for these patients no faculty scheme can be recommended .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any associated side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion . ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be tigh@@ tly supervised and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only take place in a reasonable clinical environment , in which res@@ in@@ vigor@@ ating institutions are immediately available for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies form Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the commen@@ cement of treatment .
patients , the antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , must be treated with caution by using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding the res@@ ump@@ tion of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity to be carefully anticipated after the treatment of treatment .
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to treat the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be weigh@@ ed with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms associated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to consider .
in@@ fusion can be absorbed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred to be res@@ umed .
3 will be ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ika and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the aforementioned reaction occurred .
aler@@ ts should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of larv@@ ae .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase across the mother &apos;s milk , is advised , while treating with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me does not satisfy .
the side @-@ effects in clinical trials were identified mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years of treatment ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the period of 5 years or older at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years , are frequently listed in the following table ( 1 / 10 / 10 ) ; frequent ( 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bronze pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial har@@ ness ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children un@@ wish drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , who were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under the age of 5 , with mainly heavy poison@@ ing form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby the patients aged under the age of 5 came to a Ser@@ ge trial ( on an average of 26 days compared to 45 days with patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until a premature retirement from the study ) , in 13 / 45 patients there were no proven antibodies to , including 3 patients , in which it has never come to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of o@@ cular mirror resulted in a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibodies , a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n was as@@ certain@@ ed .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase @-@ 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal until low neutral effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ - activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to not affect clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be linked to the incidence of unwanted drug interactions , even if the appearance of undes@@ irable drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzy@@ mes .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ osis @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recep@@ tors .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients from Middle phen@@ otype and only a patient showed the serious phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ator volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extensions study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients over the placebo group an improvement of the lung function and the sal@@ vi@@ ability that is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining these effects of up to 208 weeks in der@@ al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as seen from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage percentage is clin@@ ically significant over this period is not significant and the absolute lung volumes increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
the 26 patients with a he@@ he@@ atom@@ ization before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) has been fixed , which remained constant until the degree of study .
with regard to the hetero@@ genic disease outbreak , the clin@@ ically significant changes have been taken into account , the clin@@ ically significant changes in order for five efficacy studies , movement range of shoulder @-@ joints AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
it became a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined by 20 patients who were at the time of their shot in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy combustion form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
for several patients a scale growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) determined after the Z @-@ score for these age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with middle @-@ term form established a normal mental development speed , whereas in older patients with severe form of use only limited or even no progress in cognitive development were as@@ certain@@ ed .
in a phase @-@ 4 @-@ study studies have been conducted for pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ zation schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 e / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the me@@ tering scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulties with weekly input versions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ zation schem@@ ata is equal .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available each year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less affected patients .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ on@@ cology , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity and fabri@@ cation sto@@ ic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular dangers to humans .
as no case studies were performed , this medicine should not be mixed with other medicines , except with the listed below 6.@@ 6 .

A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( other medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not spread any chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) or is likely to easily reach other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer that does not attacks the record label .
A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients , which previously had not been treated , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients , previously previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ ens , as only some therapy .
to reduce adverse effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition to an &quot; Anti@@ eme@@ tic &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( for a liquid lack ) .
in case of patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects may occur , the treatment should be re@@ marked , deduc@@ ted or reduce the dose .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ acted in its active shape goes easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of the drug and for longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received any chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta also compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine against cancer ) , and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived on average 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously had previously received an chemotherapy was the average survival @-@ time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared with 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies however , patients , in which cancer did not hold the record label , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer over@@ life times as with the compar@@ ational medicine .
September 2004 , the European Commission issued the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union .
each flow bottle has to be raised with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium in@@ chlor@@ id trig@@ gering ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the required do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from diar@@ rhe@@ a and 0.@@ 9 % sodium in@@ chlor@@ id injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml more dil@@ uted ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ car@@ cin@@ oma , except for over@@ ly plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ wer@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ cin@@ oma except for on@@ ion @-@ based plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body @-@ floor ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - In@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ ch@@ car@@ cin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment - cycle @-@ cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin @-@ transactions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 cans fo@@ lic acid and the intake should be continued during the entire treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose .
patients must also receive a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) within the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third terms of action .
in patients who received the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created before every gift a complete blood @-@ image - the , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thread of cy@@ linders .
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ G@@ OT ) and alan@@ ine @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ ing of the Nadi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riter@@ ia ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) of CT@@ C degrees 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be interrupted , until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken down when in patients after 2 dosage reduction , a hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 of age or in comparison to patients aged under 65 years of age , an increased sales risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not sufficient data to un@@ thin@@ kable and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of 4@@ 45 ml / min , no dosage adjustment necessary to go beyond the dosage adap@@ tations for all patients recommended dosage adjustment .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients with liver function control of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - threshold and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ values of &gt; 3.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( with the presence of liver metastatic ha@@ vens ) , not specifically in studies .
patients need to be monitored with regard to the button of the button and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed may not be administered to patients before their absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ates return a value of between 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ roid number once again reaches a value of 7@@ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ ahl , Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te and maxim@@ ally non @-@ ugly toxicity , such as it has been observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of de@@ mat@@ ological toxicity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was be@@ amed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients need to be reli@@ ant with p@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous in@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , intended for treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is required , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s have to be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occur , they had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid - accumulation in trans@@ cellular space is a dra@@ inage of the result in front of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment will be weigh@@ ed .
5 serious cardiovascular abnorm@@ alities , including m@@ yo@@ genes , and cereb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ dant life @-@ di@@ mp@@ ed ( except yellow fever , this vaccination is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irrever@@ sible sk@@ inn@@ ation of the reproductive capacity is carried out by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment - g@@ profit to obtain advice on the sperm count .
in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance OF 80 ml / min ) , high doses can lead non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ istic@@ ic ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses ( from 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ ly appearance of side effects .
therefore caution is advisable when in patients with normal renal function ( Kre@@ at@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , 80 ml / min ) high doses could be applied by N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in high doses .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ es@@ - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since no data is available in terms of interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half time like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ om@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - fixed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ ally rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient - ducks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ bre ol@@ ites are expected to be an application in pregnancy with severe birth @-@ def@@ ective .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary - demanding and after careful abor@@ tion of usage for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since the possibility of irrever@@ sible damage of reproductive capacity is carried out by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment commen@@ cement , advice on the sperm count .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk comes over and unwanted effects in the distill@@ ate inf@@ ant cannot be excluded .

AL@@ IM@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic medication that performs its effect by att@@ oo@@ ed fol@@ ly @-@ dependent metabolic processes , which are necessary for the cell rep@@ lication .
in vit@@ ro studies revealed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ frac@@ ase acts with several targets by blocking the thy@@ ro@@ dy@@ lat@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ o@@ cular reduction ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ at@@ dependent key@@ note of the de Nov@@ o Bios@@ yn@@ thesis by Th@@ y@@ mid@@ - and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ blind , random@@ ized , simply @-@ blind Phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin for patients with mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om showed that with AL@@ IM@@ TA and Cis@@ pl@@ atin patients treated a clin@@ ically significant advantage of such patients with AL@@ IM@@ TA and Cis@@ pl@@ atin patients treated a clin@@ ically significant advantage of such patients suffering only with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was made in the population of all patients which were received in the treatment poor ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om has been shown in the application of the Lun@@ ch@@ ild@@ hood symptom@@ sk@@ ala in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a- arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment were caused by an improvement of the lung function in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and a distor@@ tion of the lung function in the course of time in the controversy .
a multi@@ centric , random@@ ized , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in Pati@@ ents with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy followed a medi@@ an over@@ life time of 8,@@ 3 months with AL@@ IM@@ TA @-@ treated patients ( influenza to Tre@@ at Pop@@ ulation n = 2@@ 83 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months to treated with doc@@ et@@ axel patients ( IT@@ T n = 2@@ 88 ) .

it is applied to overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) from 8@@ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie poor , fatty food .
patients who take care of All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
these enzy@@ mes are in@@ hibited , they can not build some fats in the food , thus causing a quarter of the associated fats bl@@ amed with the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared with 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of more than 28 kg / m2 , patients had received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg at the intake of placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no loss of weight loss could be observed .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are ö@@ y stain@@ s at after , Fl@@ atus ( Win@@ de ) with Stu@@ h@@ lab@@ s , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rons , fet@@ al / edy chair , flat@@ ness ( wind ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( Win@@ de ) and soft chairs .
it may not be applied to patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the Organ@@ izations of transplan@@ tation ) or using medicines such as War@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be applied in patients suffering from a long term mal@@ absorption of syndrome ( in case not enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited with a permit to launch of Or@@ list@@ at G@@ SK in the entire European Union .
alli is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ( 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical , fet@@ ched diet .
alli should not be applied by children and young people under 18 , because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal resor@@ ted , is necessary with aging and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adaptation of the dosage is necessary .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ ol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likelihood of appearance gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase when alli is taken along with a o@@ aks of sol@@ o@@ y or o@@ fer@@ ous diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with an improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients , the alli and medicine against hyper@@ tension or increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ists whether the dosage of these medicines must be adjusted .
it is recommended to make additional fluctu@@ ating measures to bend in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases , with the simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in has been observed an ann@@ u@@ ary of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ plastic .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal , rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
most patients treated with Or@@ list@@ at for up to 4 full years , the concentr@@ ations of the vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the standard area .
however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement assume to ensure adequate vit@@ amine intake ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
after the gift of a mal@@ dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers , who at the same time observed Or@@ list@@ at , a minor withdrawal from the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side @-@ effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects have been determined from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally lightweight and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data does not be invaluable ) .
the incidence of well @-@ known side effects which have been established after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ question@@ able size .
† There is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli may lead to sti@@ kle@@ mm@@ ungen with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual doses of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multi@@ plying up to 400 mg three times daily have been administered over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after market launch reported cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , either no side @-@ effects or similar side effects as reported in the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals can be assumed by a quick back @-@ formation system , which can be attributed to the li@@ pass@@ able characteristics of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine through the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and Panam@@ anian Li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical studies was derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food @-@ fet@@ ts .
two double @-@ flas@@ hes , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I , 28 kg / m2 reflect the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ ched diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight versus the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as part of those studies who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value : 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2,8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in the L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols was 3.5 % ( output value 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) .
plasma concentr@@ ations of non metabolic or@@ list@@ at were not measurable for 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , in therapeutic doses could not be spor@@ a@@ dically in the plasma only spor@@ a@@ dically and at extremely low concentr@@ ations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without evidence of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients , whom the minimal system@@ ically resor@@ ted dose were administered , could be identified two major metabolic disorders , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ lys@@ si@@ fied Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of N @-@ format@@ ting leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , which presented approxim@@ ate 42 % of the total plastic concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety sp@@ on@@ cology , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ cer@@ ous potential and reprodu@@ ci@@ bility , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any special danger to humans .

Alo@@ xi is used for chemotherapy and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy , which are excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ eme@@ tic ) .
the application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group does not exist enough information .
this means that the active ingredient is the attachment of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recep@@ tors in the intest@@ ines .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy regim@@ ens who are strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , the excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
for a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values include 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 by 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission shared the Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the acquisition of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : to the prevention of acu@@ ated nausea and vom@@ iting with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy due to cancer disease and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting that is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids due to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be supervised with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ liter@@ al or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable at the current gift of Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron using medicines that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ - interval prolon@@ gs or which are inc@@ lined to such an extension .
in the days of chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is to be used neither for prevention nor treatment for treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron is not the targeted activity of the five subjects of chemotherapy ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a ste@@ aling @-@ - concentration or@@ alen Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , one of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors .
in a population based pharmac@@ ological analysis , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , ne@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron .
experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies do not lie before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observing side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least stood with Alo@@ xi in connection , headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of surplus @-@ sensitive actions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest doses showed similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events such as in the other me@@ tering groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to observe .
there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for alo@@ xi@@ fication .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 , cyclo@@ phosph@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 m@@ c@@ eg@@ tron ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given to day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind experiment , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with over 60 mg / m2@@ cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron that were given to 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of the studies with ocr@@ atic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron was comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron possesses the ability to block the I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als and re@@ polar@@ ization of the I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als and extend the duration of the potential .
the objective of the study carried out by 221 healthy participants in the study was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron in single pants from 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a initial elimination of the plasma @-@ centr@@ ations a slow elimination of the body with an average termin@@ al half time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentr@@ ations of the time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average mean ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ otic ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic sim@@ ulations indicate that once a daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron was comparable with that after unique intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the entry of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % will be eliminated by the kidneys , and about another 50 % will be converted into two primary Met@@ abol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on the metabolic isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the iso@@ phic C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous sub@@ dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron have found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron as un@@ altered active ingredients made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a unique intraven@@ ous sp@@ ection with healthy was the total @-@ body @-@ tot@@ alling 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ otic fluid increases , a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which can be considered sufficient about the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to clinical use .
10 From prehistoric studies revealed evidence that Pal@@ on@@ o@@ tron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and re@@ polar@@ ization and can extend the potential for action .
high doses Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron ( each dose uncovered in about the 30@@ le of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ acks , pancre@@ as , tri@@ p@@ en@@ mark , and skin tum@@ ours by rats , but not on mice .
underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high do@@ ings and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C is recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C ( 6 million IE / ml injection ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ phe@@ on a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A must be resem@@ ble an effective element that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Re@@ ference practices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
al@@ phe@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one through a virus infection infection ) .
in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination the liver tissue damage indicates , moreover , the values of the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic alan@@ neur@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced , which bin@@ ds these to the formation of the substance .
the manufacturer of al@@ phe@@ on laid data against the comparison of al@@ phe@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness at Hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C the effectiveness of al@@ phe@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of the reference practice to 4@@ 55 patients .
in the study was measured how many patients were reported to 12 out of 48 therapy weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int htt@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is . what were the greatest concerns which have prompted the CH@@ MP to the recommendation to fail approval for the in@@ traffic ?
furthermore , concerns have been expressed concern that the data for the stability of the substance and the pharmaceutical drug has not suff@@ ice .
the number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment with Al@@ phe@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ phe@@ on fl@@ amm@@ ing the disease with more patients back on than with the reference pharmac@@ eu@@ tics ; moreover , Al@@ phe@@ on had more side effects .
aside from that , in the study , the test has been investig@@ ating the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently valid@@ ated .
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ peti@@ go ( a combination of cr@@ atic skin infection ) and small infected in@@ gen@@ ces ( risk or car@@ eless ) , de@@ ple@@ ted and gen@@ dered wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ gen@@ o@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not address the patient after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial giant cells ( the parts of the bacterial cell that proteins be produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was delayed by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo pre@@ tend to treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ unden , Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ ine showed similar contact : if the results of both studies were taken together in Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment .
however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused by the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( failed hollow in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation of the order .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections over the risks are ou@@ tw@@ eigh@@ ed : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ gen@@ ces , de@@ ple@@ dges or gen@@ dered wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the in@@ traffic of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with which no improvement within two or three days are likely to be investigated once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation through the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ in@@ tment , the treatment is broken down , the o@@ be carefully deduc@@ ted and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or is believed ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in secondary open wounds , the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was caused by patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ day treatment , no improvement or a deterioration of the infected position occurs .
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sh@@ opped skin or infected superficial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant im@@ itation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After current gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not necessary for necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a re@@ producing sto@@ ic@@ ity after oral intake and are inadequate regarding a statement regarding the birth and f@@ ateful / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to pre@@ ach the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
when deciding whether the breastfeeding has continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / finished , is between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical studies at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most commonly reported side @-@ effect irritation during the administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
there is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a particular ties of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ ological Ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ mitt@@ ent anti@@ bacterial fabrics .
data point out that the bonds of Bosnian Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bind@@ ings and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ing centre .
due to the bond of this bond of inhibit@@ ing Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block some P @-@ bond interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub @-@ units .
if the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should be applied to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection @-@ forms , a consultation should be pursued by experts .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine has been placed daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on a sli@@ pping skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ine twice daily for 5 days on the topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma were obtained .
the sampling took place on days 3 or 4 with the adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic admission to the people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
metabolic met@@ aphor@@ ism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver disease was primarily conve@@ yed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxicity to rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid .
in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ review on pleasures and / or chromos@@ om@@ ale effects in the mouse @-@ Ly@@ mph@@ oma test or in cultures human peripher@@ y blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for the In @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ investigation chromos@@ ome effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure was reached as the highest valued exposure to the people ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ opped skin ) :

Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not yet im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied as part of two doses existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason Ambi@@ rix can only be used when the immun@@ ization consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccine can be led out of two doses .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix can be given Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , &quot; as it can defend against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccination Twin@@ rix vaccine since 1997 and the vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of one out of three doses existing vaccines .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as proof of the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody ti@@ ally one month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month gap between the injections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection , redness , mat@@ ernity ( fatigue ) as well as irritation .
Ambi@@ rix may respond to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company Gla@@ xo@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals s.@@ a. for a permit to the in@@ traffic of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme for the Grun@@ di@@ m@@ mun@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is presented on the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ hed chim@@ age is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines or with a combination .
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ Hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies lie in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vaccines .
it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have addressed on a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , a refres@@ hed chim@@ ist as protection might be protected as they are also in no longer detec@@ table antibodies possibly protected by immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all injections , in the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction , the corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately .
if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ mp@@ ing scheme is recommended with the combination @-@ simple , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ antes hepatitis B surface .
in Po@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis patient and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , under certain circumstances , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies are not reached , so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required .
since an intra@@ oral injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication , these injections should be avoided .
at Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ top@@ ie or blood @-@ sensi@@ cal disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected into sub@@ cut@@ aneous problems , as it can come to bleeding in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .
when Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ - , te@@ ell@@ ular be@@ zz@@ anine and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined Mas@@ ern@@ ut vaccine vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was adequate ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it has to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 vaccines of this wording in adults was the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ atives .
in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ernity in a comp@@ utation rate per vaccine , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the promot@@ ers observed , compared with 3@@ 9,@@ 1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
after the entire vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the promot@@ ers , the Ambi@@ rix had received , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % with the subjects that had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - combin@@ ant .
however , the frequency of Mat@@ ernity was comparable to a pro@@ ps ( i.e. over the entire vaccine with 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ ers , which were Ambi@@ rix compared with 3@@ 6,@@ 2 % in the promot@@ ers , which received the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant ) .
the frequency weigh@@ ted pain and mat@@ ernity was small and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combin@@ ant vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - until 11 @-@ year vaccine was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ able with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated carbon @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - J@@ olds , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent appearance of pain ( at the injection ) per dose , not per promot@@ er , reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations which reported on heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination @-@ simple with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface exc@@ uses , was statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials , which were conducted at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions were for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ convert rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , for month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses received Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combin@@ ant with three doses .
for the 2@@ 89 persons , whose immun@@ o@@ chemistry was pri@@ ver@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ e@@ duction rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ dosage substance is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response that were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after completion of the full vaccine ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vaccination were either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination @-@ simple using 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
persons , who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ m@@ mun@@ ization between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immun@@ og@@ ation campaign against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which was established after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simple , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ an A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine .
when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix starts at the same time with a refres@@ hed di@@ ph@@ ther@@ mic , te@@ ar@@ ism , az@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ us , in@@ activated poli@@ tic vaccines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ umps of the vaccine vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ e@@ ders and ser@@ o@@ converting rates as for the earlier formulation .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other roads , such as bathing in de@@ hydr@@ ated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ unt face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines the Ambi@@ rix can protect not completely from an infection with hepatitis or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines or hepatitis B / or hepatitis C ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick ) , a vaccination may not prevent a vaccine .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver or cause symptoms which are similar to those in a Hepatitis or Hepatitis B infection cannot be conve@@ yed .
• If your child already has an allergic reaction to ambient or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express through ju@@ ck@@ ling rash , respiratory not or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B once you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• if you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually planned administration of the second vaccination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your Child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased salary of effective ingredients per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated carbon @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine against termination of the vaccine .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from persons who suffer from severe blood@@ stream disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle tissue . • if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body resistance , or if you / your child undergo a tick @-@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons to vaccination may not be sufficient , so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction is on vaccination .
21 Sa@@ gen you to your doctor if you / your child will take further medicines , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated without prescription , or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated , / or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been administered / or has planned this in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs .
if Ambi@@ rix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix Swan or breastfeeding women will not be administered unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) with you / your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
it is very common ( more than 1 case per 10 co@@ ded doses ) : • sor@@ eness or complaints at the inhal@@ ing or redness • Mat@@ ernity • In@@ cre@@ ability • headaches • loss of appetite
which is common ( up to 1 case per 10 t@@ im@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection center • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ om@@ men@@ arity • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms
further side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with compar@@ atively combination or individual drugs for hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 prescribed doses ) have been reported :
these include col@@ on limited or expan@@ sive sp@@ ans , the so@@ cks can be or blows @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye @-@ part and the face , scar@@ ing breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure and awareness .

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has become known since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ traffic process , the CH@@ MP appeared that the value @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix has only been launched in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
NSC 631570 can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ completed enzyme def@@ ective or with hyp@@ am@@ mon@@ ical encephal@@ opathy ( brain ) as a result of high am@@ mon@@ y concentration .
art@@ aps - split into several individual pants to meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food mixed or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ iera ( through the stomach in the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study , there cannot be compared to any other treatment or with placebo ( a head@@ quarter , that is , without a substance ) .
skin may also lead to loss loss , an abnormal acid in the blood , depression , friction , hydr@@ ation , fluid loss , taste or taste , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , sti@@ p@@ ation , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain .
the Committee on Human therapeutic agents ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ orph@@ an in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be effectively prevented from the ur@@ inary cycle .
am@@ ic@@ aps has been approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency have already manifested in the new@@ bor@@ age bracket ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ fac@@ tual form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which manifes@@ ts after the first months of life ) then there is an indication for use when in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ical encephal@@ ographic En@@ cephal@@ opathy .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with eggs , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and in growing and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ app@@ ucc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0,@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered with eggs , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ sop@@ ran@@ ul@@ cer@@ a exists when the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium y@@ yl@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as with Nat@@ ri@@ re@@ tention , and oil @-@ shu@@ ffle patients only with caution .
da Met@@ abol@@ ishing and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MONA@@ PS should be used only with liver or kidney failure , only with extreme care .
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of the ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated by humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients stood at least an undes@@ irable event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( 1 / 10 / 10 ) , common ( 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old anor@@ tic patient which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ kal@@ ine , cor@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ y neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of an over@@ dose entered a 5 month old baby @-@ child with a cute single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limit administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active connection that ranks through acet@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is eliminated by the kidneys .
Stö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally saw phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram bi@@ ased nat@@ uro@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen are produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is provided early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival prospects and the clinical result .
the prognosis of the earliest mani@@ ac form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ lic@@ ist , and the disease carried itself with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogues within the first year of life .
through Ha@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative paths of nit@@ rogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ated K@@ ost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to diagnose the survival @-@ rate of newborn with post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first months of life ) diagnosed in 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rates were treated before the initial appearance of a hyper@@ met@@ am@@ mon@@ tic encephal@@ opathy , but even in these patients there was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form of the condition ( including feminine patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otes form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ tic encephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet was the survival rate 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition .
it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created .
the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his metabol@@ ites were obtained in so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of sodium and phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a or@@ onal single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary im@@ balances or hem@@ os@@ glo@@ be@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ ally fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is detec@@ table in plasma .
in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which have repeatedly been treated with sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single pants ) , the medium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate con@@ cent@@ red on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ical product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no en@@ cla@@ genic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who have not swal@@ low tablets or patients with eggs ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l or a no@@ stri@@ de .
after previous clinical experience the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in growing and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat f@@ ters were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de .
a likely toxic response to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year old anor@@ tic patient which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ kal@@ ine , cor@@ y@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ y neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
Stö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally saw phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess of surplus value .
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram bi@@ ased nat@@ uro@@ yl@@ but@@ yl@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen are produced .
already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition .
after a or@@ onal single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
with this procedure , the small measuring spoon was 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to obtain the medication over a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver disease are missing , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cking waste products that can accum@@ ulate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if at you are conducted laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
in@@ gesting AM@@ MONA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you take other medicines or have recently been taken , even if it is not prescription drug .
during the lac@@ tation period , you are allowed to take AM@@ MONA@@ PS because the drug could move into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , headaches , flav@@ our@@ ing , im@@ itation of o@@ bedi@@ ence , dis@@ satisfaction , memory disorders and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ log@@ istic states were observed .
if you find one of these symptoms , sit down immediately with your doctor or with the emergency medical clinic for the purpose of appropriate treatment .
if you forgot the intake of AM@@ MONA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

angi@@ ox is applied to the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ tin@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar ) , for example at inst@@ ab@@ iler Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ cr@@ ard@@ ently ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ measuring instrument at the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or E@@ KG ) .
if angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who administered to an PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients attended the trial study on the treatment of ACS machines , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all of G@@ abe or in conjunction with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ IA inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I compared .
while PCI has often been a St@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the Arctic , to prevent a lock ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in case of preventing new events ( deaths , seiz@@ ures or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ ization ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients suffering from an PCI , angi@@ ox was just as effective as yeast in relation to all indicators , except in severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients that may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other mil@@ u@@ dine or one of the other components .
it must also not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or infection @-@ infection .
the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that angi@@ ox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a re@@ movable replacement for he@@ par@@ in .
in September 2004 , the European Commission adopted The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd approval for the in@@ traffic of angi@@ ox throughout the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides attack ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) for an emergency attack , or if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ ald@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous type of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if patient is conducted in further form a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after PCI according to clinical requirements the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h are taken for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately before the procedure should be administered by 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with an PCI consists of a initi@@ als intraven@@ ous type of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a result of immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt @-@ gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second type of bolt should be carried out of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed before use and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis quickly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to an PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din against ACS or not ) , should be used to lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h .
lies the ACT @-@ value below 225 seconds , is a second stu@@ d@@ dose of 0.3 mg / kg to ad@@ minister and the ACT 5 minutes after the second stu@@ d@@ dose is again examined .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in the approval was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dosage adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox @-@ contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ frac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours following the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of lower molecular entities .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredients or other components or against Hir@@ u@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood disorder due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of h@@ emo@@ st@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or irrever@@ sible endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • heavy renal damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment of symptoms and signs of a bleeding particularly when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even when using PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most bleeding may occur to arter@@ ial pun@@ ctu@@ ation , in patients who occur on a per@@ kut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding .
in patients who are war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , should be considered to be monitoring the IN@@ R advertising ( International Norm@@ ally rati@@ o ) , to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will be reached again prior to the treatment existing level .
starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sion@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these agents increase the blood danger .
in combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din with thy@@ mus aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ ania or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological skins parameters are regularly scrut@@ in@@ ized in each case .
the animal studies are inadequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below Section 5.3 ) .

Ap@@ id@@ ra will be used to treat adults , young people and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the th@@ igh@@ s or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a continuous fusion with an ins@@ ulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient ins@@ ulin to regulating the glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or may not process the ins@@ ulin .
Insul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very slightly from Human@@ ins@@ ulin and the change means that it affects faster and a shorter period of time has a short @-@ effective Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
Ap@@ id@@ ra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between 4 and 17 years .
in type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin cannot be effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ ulated hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adult @-@ 1 diabetes was determined after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in ins@@ ulin per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human@@ em normal ulin .
Ap@@ pro@@ ra may not be applied to patients who may possibly have hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ins@@ ulin , or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for approval for the in@@ traffic of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdom@@ inal ceiling , the th@@ igh , or the del@@ im@@ cle to use sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion or sub@@ cut@@ aneous in@@ fusion in the area of pancre@@ as .
due to the decreased glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin need of ins@@ ulin in patients with a restriction of liver function .
any change of the effectiveness , the brand ( Her@@ - ) , of ins@@ ulin ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ulin ) and / or the production method can undergo a change in ins@@ ulin delivery .
3 A inadequate dosage or the demo@@ li@@ tion of treatment , particularly in patients with an ins@@ ulin @-@ duty diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic converter ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the substance profile of the ins@@ ulin and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment schem@@ as .
among the substances that can increase the blood@@ shed activity and reinforce the inclin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in converter , fibro@@ us , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , Flu@@ o@@ amin @-@ Ox@@ id@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ x@@ yp@@ hen , Sal@@ iz@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tic , such as bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter @-@ regulation be weak@@ ened or missing .
animal experimental studies for re@@ producing sto@@ ic@@ ity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in relation to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether the ins@@ ulin enters into the human body &apos;s milk , but generally ins@@ ulin does not enter into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ ted to oral applications .
in the following , those of clinical trials are well @-@ known , group@@ ed according to system organs and ordered by decreasing the frequency of their appearance ( very common : 1 / 10 ; 1 : 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare ( frequency based on the availability data is not invaluable ) .

le@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy Wir@@ d failed to change the injection of injection within the injection range , can occur in the result of a li@@ pod@@ olog@@ ph@@ ie at the injection .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic with consci@@ ous@@ y can be treated by a in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by a physician , or treated by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
after a glucose infection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the pri@@ ze@@ - cause for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
ins@@ ulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous food of ins@@ ulin delivery occurs faster and the active time is shorter than at hu@@ g@@ man@@ em normal ins@@ ulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus ins@@ ulin is a dose @-@ proportionate therapy capacity , and with 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase of glucose impact , just like human@@ ins@@ ulin .
ins@@ ulin has twice as fast as normal human@@ ins@@ ulin and achie@@ ves the complete glucose level of approximately 2 hours earlier as Human@@ ins@@ ulin .
from the data was apparent that at an application of ins@@ ulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ cal gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human@@ em normal ulin , which is given 30 minutes before meal .
was ins@@ ulin in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control was reached as with human@@ em normal ulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
ins@@ ulin ins@@ ulin is implemented in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal - a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as with human@@ em normal ulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ten in front of the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery in G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given earlier ( figure 1@@ A ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) and compared to human@@ em normal ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
ins@@ ulin delivery in G@@ abe 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after the beginning of the meal compared to human@@ em Nor@@ - mal@@ ins@@ ulin , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
