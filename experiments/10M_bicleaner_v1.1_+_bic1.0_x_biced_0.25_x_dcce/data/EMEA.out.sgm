<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Appeal report (EPAR), which explains what the studies carried out on Human Rights Committee (CHMP), in order to get recommendations on the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your disease or their treatment, please refer to the EPAR (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of melting tablets, as a solution to insertion (1 mg / ml) and as injection resolution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Humres thinking and Speak, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and insanity; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disorder, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of the abnormal brightness) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe maneuver episodes and prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection resolution is applied to the quick control of gestant anxiety or behavioral disorders, if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to one or the melt-up in patients that the swallowing of tablets difficulties are being prepared.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines that are built just like Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal transmission between brain cells through "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances, which enable the communication of nerve cells among each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably works mainly as "partial agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazol such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in less dimensions than the neurotransmitters works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, creating psychotic or manic symptoms and prevent their reoccur.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify, the re-emergence of symptoms, was examined in three studies over to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection resolution has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were stacked out over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In a further study Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperative idol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that were to occur to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have been stabilized with atbilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection resolution has been observed in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from peacomepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the variation of symptoms of patients with a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients suffering from treatment languages were examined.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies through to investigate how the body cover the melting and the solution to tear (up).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injection solution, patients showed Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased unrest than the patients received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify in four of the five short-term studies have been more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of effective than placebo the re-occur manager in previously-treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of afflicted unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for insertion (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are exathic interference (incontrollability), somnial (pervility), saliva-hypersecretion (increased storage production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnie (sleeping disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate-heavy episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes of the treatment with Aripiprazol pretend to overoutweighs the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection-solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable to outweighs the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">As of June 2004, the European Commission issued the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to heavy manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole languages (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily irrespective of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">A increased effectiveness at metering during a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients of 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdosis should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 induction is deducted from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicide is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and in some cases reported after the beginning or the change of an anti-psychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased suicide risk associated with Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiac disease (myogenes, excessive disorders), cerebrovascular diseases (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure-pressure drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that occurred a year or less, there were occasional reports on during treatment with Aripiprazol inflating Dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If at a ABILIFY patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyskinities, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient signs signs and symptoms developed on a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medicines must be abused, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be applied to patients with crampfanatics in the Anamnese or at states that are associated with caution, with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol, an elevated mortality risk compared to the placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and the speak for unwanted cerebrovascular events with Aripiprazol treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with Ketoazioutlet or hyperosmolarem coma or death, has been reported in patients with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related events with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drug-treated patients who allow for direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, Polyurie, polyphagie and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">A weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania, the application of antipsychotics, where weight gain is observed as a side-effect and could lead to severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazol is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines that is taken overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2-Antagonis Famotidin, an gastric blocker, reduces the residue rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not relevant as clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy probanden, a high-effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinoin) decreased the AUC of Aripiprazol by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosisreductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">With CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") Metabolisers can result in the common application with high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plastic levels of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common gift of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should overoutweighs the potential risks to the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-protein, should have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosisreductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After lowering the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY on the dose-height before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with ABILIFY can be administered together with a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies showed doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl per day no significant effect on the metabolites of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-Methoxymorphinan (Ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the inadequate data base for the safety of people and due to the resulting concerns in animal studies, this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits are clearly justifying the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, in other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned before, dangerous machines, including vehicles, to operate until they are sure that Aripiprazol has no negative impact on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects appear more common (1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant adverse reactions (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients treated with Aripiprazol, a total lower incidence (25.8%) by EPS including parinsonism, Acathic, Dystonie and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperative idol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazl-treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazl, and 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes at bipolar-I disorder - In a controlled trial of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under Haloperative idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term development phase over 26 weeks at a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazolamed treatment and 15,7% for patients treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups among Aripiprazol and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters occurred, revealed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases of the CPK (creatine-phosphate), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazol treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side-effects caused in connection with an anti-psychotic therapy, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and increased mortality rate, adverse events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, incidental or intentional overdoings were observed with Aripiprazol alone in adult patients with cherished doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis during the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; however, it is unlikely that Haealysis is in the treatment of an overdose of benefits, since Aripiprazol shows a high plastic carrier.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the effectiveness of Aripiprazole at schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder over the combination of a participle agonist effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and for serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor and an excessive affinity to the dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergen and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In gift of Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks in healthy subjects, the Positetops-Tomographie showed a dose-dependent reduction in the bond of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the Nucleus caudatus and the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a Haloperative idol-controlled trial, 52 per cent of the responds of patients who included a response to the study medication, in both groups similar (Aripiprazol 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values of measurement range, which were defined as secondary studies, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- anti-scale scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of relapses, which lay at 34% in the Aripiprazol Group and in 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanka controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients involved and in which the primary study group 'weight gain' was significantly less patient a weight gain from at least 7% compared to the output value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazol a compared placebo superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar-I disorder showed Aripiprazol compared to placebo no superior effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo- and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazol showed a comparison of placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a steady effect, which was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazol also pointed out a comparative share of patients with symptomatic remission of mania, such as lithium or semiidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partially over 2 weeks do not respond to Lithium or Valproat Monotherapy for therapeutical efficiency in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who reached a remission with Aripiprazol compared to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar approach, predominantly in preventing a return to mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 for the stretching and hydroxyction of Aripiprazol is responsible, the N-Dealkymodelling is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The middle elimination age is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole at extensive Metabolisers over CYP2D6 and in approximately 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism about CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">With Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacoinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as well as the pharmacoinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A haven-specific evaluation of the pharmacoinetics revealed no indication of clinically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacoinetic of Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic properties of Aripiprazl and dehydro-Aripiprazol were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy proportions.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study at Probanden with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on pharmacobezol and dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety sponcology, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, icotoxicity, and the canogenic potential, the preclinical data provided no special dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxic effects were only observed in doses or expositions that have significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects split a dose-dependent side-dependent on rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (corresponds to the 3- to 10times of the middle Steady-State-exposure (AUC) at female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10s of the middle Steady-State-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maxim dose (AUC) at the recommended maxaldosis in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis has been determined by Aripiprazol in the Galle of Monpiprazol in the Galle of monkey (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maxaldosis in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations in human Galle during the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of sulphate conjugate of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol were not found more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and lie far below the threshold (6%) of vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits these effects were observed according to dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11ses of the middle Steady-State AUC in the recommended clinical maxaldosis.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikri-active ingredient that promotes the depot of micro-rotors from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting its deformulations.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an imitation of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubular network, which is essential for the vitational Interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumum conveys the Transcytosis of Plasmaze components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies have been proven that the presence of Albumine enhances the transport of Paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelitional transport through the gp-60-Albuminrezeptor is conveyed and due to the Albanuminator Proteins SPARC (convented protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumors.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of abrasion for metastatic Mammakarcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-defined studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised phase III equivalent study.</seg>

<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher according to xane-Gabe higher (43%) than after a solvent-sized Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher in xane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature about in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue densities, the paclitaxel was primarily metabolized to 6α-hydroxypaclitaxel and two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α-3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute increinfusion of 260 mg / m2. xane in patients with metastatic mammakarcinoma was the mid-value for cumulative effect of the unaltered active ingredient 6α-Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renale Clearance.</seg>

<seg id="749">Summary of the EPAR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Appeal report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee on Human Rights Committee (CHMP) investigates the studies carried out on recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is applied to the treatment of type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in which Metformin (a diabetesmeditate) can be applied together with another Diabetesmedial System (Dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It may additionally be applied to Metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sultry-fuel or insulin, the previous dose of the sultry and insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should be reduced the dose of sulphylchlorine and insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's body can be better utilisable and the blood sugar level is declining, whereby type 2-2 diabetes can be set.</seg>
<seg id="754">For more than 1 400 patients, the effectiveness of Actos were examined in tripletherapy; thereby patients received a combination of metformin with a sultry fuel, in addition they received up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemmoglobin, HbA1c) measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which makes the blood sugar lowered by using the doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study the effect of the additional gift of accounts for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylharniller in lowering of the HbA1c-values by 0.94%, while the additional fee of placebo resulted in lowering of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patient which took Actos in addition to insulin, compared to 0.14% in the patient which took place additionally.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side-effects associated with Actos were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory (colds), weight gain and hypothesia (diminished sensitivity to irritate).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos must neither be applied to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) to Pioglitazon or one of the other components, still in patients with liver problems, cardiac insufficiency or diabetic Ketoazioutlet (high ketone mirror - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin patients where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission shared the European Commission Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited requires permission to negotiate accounts in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white until white, round, merging and wear on one side the mark "15" and on the other hand the "ACTOS" page.</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazon is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is disinfected with insulin and in which Metforming are inappropriate due to contraindications or incompatibility. (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of Pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dose-wise dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of insufficiency, weighting or estrogen, particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of insufficiency, weighting and oils, when Pioglitazon is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with Pioglitazon in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced microvascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports of cardiac insufficiency, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased risk of liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazon can not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT-Spiegel are raised up to 3-times the upper limit of the standard area, liver enzymous values are as soon as possible to control.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient symptoms developed that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torso, fatigue, loss and / or darker harn, are the liver enzymous values to review.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient continues with Pioglitazon, it should be run by the laboratory parameters of the clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon has been proven a dose-dependent weight gain, which can stir up fatty deposits, and in some cases involving fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a heredilution, under the therapy with Pioglitazon a minor reduction in the middle hmogloom values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative studies with Pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin um 3-4%) and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobins by 1-2% and the hematokrits by 1-2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity to patients, the Pioglitazon as oral or triple combination therapy with a sultry therapy or as a branch-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market, under the treatment with Thiazolidindions, including Pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of a diabetic broodems reported with a reduction of visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pioglitazon and the appearance of maculaödems if patients report on disruption of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic statement should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events concerning bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients treated with Pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated faccture incidence was 1.9 factions per 100 patient-years with the Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 factions per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular abnormalities, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Frations per 100 patient-years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient-years) were treated with patients with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy, and if a patient desires or occurs, treatment (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Diganoin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformities.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. orale contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium blocker and HMGCoA reductasformer are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazon around the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the case of treatment with Pioglitazon which diminishes in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance to the womb and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for flowly growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; 1 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single incidents: unknown (from this data not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the boards of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazon, ALT-attacks above the Triple of the standard range also frequently occurs under placebo, but more rarely than in comparative-groups under metformin or sulfonylharnum.</seg>
<seg id="793">In a Outcome study with patients with existing advanced miastcular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was under Pioglitazon by 1.6% higher than under placebo if Pioglitazon or w.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has been reported rarely through Heroglitazon under Pioglitazon, however, when Pioglitazon was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in Anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events related to bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazon treated groups and over 7,400 patients in patients treated with comparatively drug-treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">During a period of 3.5 years of ongoing proactive study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients who were treated with a comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="797">In taking the top dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day above seven days occurred no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to work on an activation of specific nuclear recipes (PPAR-g)), which leads in the animal model to an increased insulin-sensitivity of liver, fat, and skeletal cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazon reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued for two years to investigate the time until the retrofitting of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c, 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control could be maintained (defined as HbA1c (8.0%) by Pioglitazon at 69% of the patients treated (compared to 50% of the patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebocontrolled trial of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was discontinued despite three-month optimisation phase with insulin, to Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazon, the average HbA1c is reduced by 0.45%, compared to the patients who continued to only insulin; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with Pioglitazon's group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant withdrawal of the Albumine / Kreatine quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18 weeks written by type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials compared to placebo a reduction of the overall plasma triglyceride and the free fatty acids and an increase in the HDL- cholesterol levels as well as low, but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide, the total plastic-matrix glyceride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, under Pioglitazon, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol levels, while under metformin and Gliclacide have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride levels, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this covers an effect on the triglycerid absorption and the hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiac outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced microvascular disease in groups randomized which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral applications, Pioglitazon is quickly resorted, whereby the top concentrations can be reached to unchanging Pioglitazon in the plasma generally 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">Based on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pioglitazon, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="813">In InteraktionsStudies could be proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Diganoin, Warfarin, phenprocoumon, and metformities.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazon with Gemfibrozil (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 induction) or lowers the Plasmakonzentration of Pioglitazon (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactive marked Pioglitazon in humans the marker was mainly found in feces (55%) and to a lower scale in the harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The middle-elimination elimination time of unaltered Pioglitazone is about 5-6 hours, and the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The Plasmakonzentrations of Pioglitazon and its Metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy proportions, whereby the rates of the oral Clearance of the parent substance is similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies performed on mice, rats, dogs and monkeys-tuning after repeated administration with hamodifying, anaemia and reversible eccentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazon, which diminishes in the form of hyperinsulin anemia and increased insulin resistance to the parent and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for flowly growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), during the rat increased incidences of hyperplasia (with male and female rats) and tumours (with male rats) of the ureter epithelium induces.</seg>
<seg id="821">In a animal model of the family adenomous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions led to an increased frequency of colonists.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the address "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated faccture incidence was 1.9 factions per 100 patient-years with the Pioglitazon treated women and 1.1 factions per 100 patient-years in women who were treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular abnormalities, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Frations per 100 patient-years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient-years) were treated with patients with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin is examined by Pioglitazon or Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical studies over 1 year, under Pioglitazon showed a statistically significant withdrawal of the Albumine / Kreatine quotient compared to the output values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks Pioglitazon not only the sober triglyceride levels, but improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, this has an effect on the tryglycerid absorption and also on the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was missing the target with regard to their primary goal, a combination of the total mortalion, non-killing corvascularization and revascularization of the leg arterial arteries, place the results close that with the intake of Pioglitazon are not associated with cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white until white, round, flat and wear on one side the marking "45" and on the other hand the address "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events concerning bone broods from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.100 patients who received with Pioglitazon and received about 7,400 patients, the comparator medication showed itself a increased incidence of bone broods in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular abnormalities, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 Frations per 100 patient-years), compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 questionnaires per 100 patient-years) were treated with patients with a comparatively medication.</seg>

<seg id="1170">The drug is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transplant as it was not examined for these groups.</seg>
<seg id="1171">In the first study, at the 1 072 patients participating, the effectiveness of several adenuric-doses (once daily 80, 120 and 240 mg) was compared to that of a placebo (hypomeditate) and from Allopurinol (another medicine for the treatment of hyperuranemia).</seg>
<seg id="1172">In the second study, two doses were compared to Adenuric (once daily 80 and 120 mg) a year for 762 patients each with Allopurinol.</seg>
<seg id="1173">In both studies Allopurinol was applied at a dose of once daily 300 mg; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day.</seg>
<seg id="1174">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose urinary tract can be seen in the blood within the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1175">In the first study, 48% (126 of 262) of the patient, the adenuric recorded at a dose of once daily 80 mg, and 65% (175 of 269) of the patient, which once daily earned 120 mg in the last three measurements a urinary tract in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1176">Compared to this, this was in 22% (60 of 268) of patients under Allopurinol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenuric (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, diarrhoea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver values.</seg>
<seg id="1178">Especially in patients with cardiac cardiac disease may also be a heightened risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that Adenuric was more effective in the lowering of the urinary tract in the blood as Allopurinol, but also a higher risk of side-effects associated with the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperopaemia in diseases that have already led to urine deposits (including one from the medical history known or currently present script and / or a gichtarle).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum-packs for 2-4 weeks is still under &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l), can be considered a dosage increase at ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney functions, the effectiveness and security were not completely investigated (Kreatinventive Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see Section 5.2).</seg>

<seg id="1188">Liver disease During the clinical studies of phase 3 were observed slight refreshes of liver functioning with Febuxostat treated patients (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to carry out a liver functioning before the beginning of Febualty treatment and in the further course depending on clinically finding a liver function (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylin Zones were not carried out any alterations to Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibitor can lead to a rise in the ophylline of theophylline (a inhibitor of the pituitary gland was also reported to other XO-Hemmer).</seg>
<seg id="1191">At Probanden was the simultaneous gift of Febuxostat and Naproxen 250 mg 2 x daily with a rise in Febuxostato (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and T1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials the application of Naproxes or other NSAR / Cox-2-shirts were not related to a clinically significant increase in undesirable events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be applied together with Colchicin or Indometacin without having a dosage adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily a mean 22% increase in AUC by Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antazipper, the magnesium-hydroxid and aluminum hydroxid (about 1 hour) is delayed and a drop in the Cmax to 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data over a very limited number of exponential pregnancies cannot be taken on side effects of Febuxostat to the pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborns.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect impact on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle, use of machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they may be quite sure that ADENURIC does not affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of the auditors reported cartooncular events was observed in the total febuxosystem in the Piotal study of phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection could be found with Febuxostat.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors associated with these patients were an arterial erotic disorder and / or a myostard attack or a decomputed cardiac insufficiency in the medical history.</seg>

<seg id="1204">The treatment studies reported during the long-term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of phase 3 (see table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events have been reported in all Febuaries stat- treatment groups altogether more than once and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in longtime extensions studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to them occasionally on.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events have been reported in the Piotal studies of phase 3 for these doses either at all or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypanaesthesia, obliteral insufficiency, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in potassium concentration in the blood, increase of TSH concentration in the blood, decline of lymphocytic amounts, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>

<seg id="1216">The reduction of the serum sails at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed in week 2 and maintained permanently across the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum cancer &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney dysfunctions The APEX-study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1219">An ADENURIC was the primary efficacy approval at 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There was no clinically significant differences in the percentage of serumharnacid concentration in subjects, irrespective of their renal function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum perventric concentrations were taken about 10 mg / dl about 40% of patients (APEXE and fact-study) had a Serumharnacid concentration of about 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years during the phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum bricks amounted to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l), so that less than 3% of patients needed in the months 16-24 treatment against a gloss treatment (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gloss).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction of the shift hub, which at 54% of patients had a complete disappearance of the periods up to month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received a long term treatment with Febuxostat (5,0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long term extension studies (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy issues the maximum plasma-concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma-centric time (AUC) from Febuxostat to administration is easier and multitually doses from 10 mg to 120 mg dosisproportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Febuxostat a rise in AUC, which is greater than the dose-proportionate increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking a simple or multi-pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the Cmax is about 2,8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change has been observed in the percentage drop in serumharnacid concentration, provided that this was checked (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or insertion of other medicines (including Antazida, calcium and Vitamine complementary).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of food-tube, the patient may not take up until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union, the company placed data from earlier studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to detect the effectiveness of ADROVANCE in relation to increasing the vitamin D reflection.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors were treated with ADROVANCE (11%) than those who took exclusively alendronat (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also placed data prior to which the ADROVANCE contained Alendronat dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal heats (muscle, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system, speculators (ulcera), ulceral (ulcera), chipped abdomen (born stomach) as well as suction to repel.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with etorphous hypersensitivity (allergy) against Alendronat, vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It must not be applied in disease cases, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who are not able to stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">Following references are precisely to follow to reduce the risk of ösophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE shall be swallowed after the standing of the day with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml). • The patients should not crush the tablet or tablet in the mouth. • The patients should not take place before the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic Ulkus, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplasty, are only given under special care (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Ösophageal reactions, such as Ösophagitis, ösophageal ulcera and ösophageal erosions, rarely followed by ösophageal striches, were reported in patients under the intake of alendronat (partial, these severe and required a hospitative instruction).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all the signs and symptoms that may point out to possible malophageal irritation, and the patients should be pointed out, in the appearance of symptoms of malophageal irritation, pain in the swallowing or retromortal pain or new or limmering socks burn the medicine to pick and consult medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of heavy malophageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the drug properly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that may point to a malophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all faculty instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">During large clinical trials with Alendronat no higher risk has been determined, rarely (after market launch) gastric and duodenalulcera, including some serious and with complications, reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrose from the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose regimen contains predominantly intravenously, Bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to give the indications of whether the demining of a bisphosphonattherapy in patients who need a kieffer surgical procedure, reduces the risk of osteoneclipids of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the doctor is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">The patients should be instructed to take them during omisable taking a dose ADROVANCE to take the tablet next morning after they have noticed its failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets on the same day but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the weekday.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases that affect the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism), should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alerting foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplement, antazida and some orale medicine can interfere with the Resorption from Alendronat if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore patients must wait after taking Alendronat at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific Interaction studies were not conducted, Alendronat was taken jointly with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines, without a clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use at postmenopausals women and is therefore neither during pregnancy nor by nursing women.</seg>

<seg id="1438">During the subsequent revival therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplants have generally been used in blood concentrations in the area of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to severe undesirable events, including transplasses, or other side effects, which can occur in a sequence of Tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>

<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of application will address whether Advate is applied to treat bleeding or to the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles, or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma but based on a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene (DNA), which it conveys the formation of the human scent factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is a different approved drug approved in the European Union, but is otherwise manufactured, so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human and animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate Hämophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was investigated for prevention of bleeding as well as surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of Advate was evaluated in 86% of 510 new blood-septum with 'excellent' and 'good'.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, Pyrexie (fever) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied to patients who may possibly be sensitive (allergic) against the human scent factor VIII, mouse or Hamsterprotein or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission shared the Baxter AG approval for approval in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitutions are directed after the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, according to the place and extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following case, the factor VIII activity is expected to sink the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period of time (in% of the standard or in i.e. / dl).</seg>

<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger to the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, the dose of the injections of the injections and incidence of injections is to have an adequate provision of the factor VIII-plastic.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, different in vivo recovery and have different half-times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis Tur long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be doses between 20 and 40, i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII-plasma activities will not be reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with a proper dose, a test must be carried out to prove a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so others need therapeutic interventions to be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration-speed is to be directed after finding the patient, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulsive activity of factor VIII framed IgG immunoglobulins which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk, inhibitors to develop, correlated with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure stage is the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure and anamnesty development, after conversion of a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the re-operation of (low-titrigen) inhibitors observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare appearance of the Hämophilia A in women there are no experiences regarding the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The number of patients in the number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), which were all raised in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (each 3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (from 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare (1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on the available data may not be invaluable).</seg>

<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, caused by an allergy to pollen caused by inflammation of the nasal pathways in patients with nasal slimming nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents from 12 years old, the recommended dose of aeronaze is twice daily, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and will be terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be relayed to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective perseverance were the changes of the severity of hypocrisy symptoms which were reported from the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">During the constipation of the nose, except the constipation of the nose, the patients reported the aerosaze, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patient who accepted Pseudoephein alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients showed a alleviation of symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26,7% to the patient who captured the desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tick-dry, diomotor hyperactivity (throat infection), anal disease, fatigue, fatigue, Insomnie (sleeplessness), somnolenz (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleeplessness), sleeptive and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosaze may be used in patients who may possibly overflow (allergic) against disloratadine, pseudo-ephein or one of the other components, against adrenergic agents or loratadine (another medicine for treating allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosaze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from an angle glaucoma (increased eye pressure), coronary or vascular disease (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hypertension), hyperthyroid (hyperblood circulation), or have a risk for a shamanic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission of the SP SP provided an approval for the intraffic of aerosaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however, is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without them to disguise or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerosaze should not be applied due to the lack of data to unthinkable and effectiveness (see section 5.1) not being applied to children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration for 10 days, since when long-term application the activity of pseudoephein can take time off.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the decline of the swelling of the mustskins in the upper airways, the treatment may be continued with disloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze contains pseudoephein, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after the end of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combination use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconductors, Pergolid, cabal light, cabal imitamin, phenylpropanamine, phenylephrine, ephedracoline, Oxymetazolin, Naphazolin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collectively and the data are not enough to pronounce relevant recommendations on the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerosaze have not been reviewed by patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to pronounce relevant recommendations on the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that treatment at the appearance of hypertension or tyachykares or of palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headache or a strengthening of headaches) must be deducted.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patients, patients get advised: • patients under digital rhythm • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension • patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, blisters, or bronchpasm in Anamnesty.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is at least 48 hours before carrying out a matological test, as antihistamine is otherwise able to prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin-actions or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadine, where erythromycin or Ketoconazole were additionally administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the Plasmakonzentration of Desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of psychomotory tests, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with desloratadine and those treated with placebo irrespective of whether desloratadine was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the Metabolism of Desloratadin responsible enzymes has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo CYP3A4 not, and in-vitro studies have shown that the medicine CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of P-Glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The unthinkable of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences of a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency at the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproduction studies on animals do not always be transmitted to humans and due to vasoconstrical properties of pseudoephein should Aerinaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be elucidated that in very rare cases, it may come to a benomarity, which can lead to impairment or ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a ZNS depression (sedation, apnea, coma, cardiovascular abnormalities) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterals.</seg>

<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of profoundational cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / Basophiles as well as the imitation of the expressionist smoker-selector on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes, including the strengthening of subjective punctuality or the tasks connected to flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg, no increased frequency of sleepiness was found in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The orale application of pseudoephein in the recommended dosage can produce more personomimetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachykarst or manifestations of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">It took 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, whereby 414 patients received Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the total cores for symptoms (except nasal rotation swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephein on the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerosaze tablets with regard to the decreasing effect, determined by the nose-skin swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin groups.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study for the pharmaceutical pharmaceutical study of Aerinaze, Desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroralen application of Aerinaze with healthy interbanden over 14 days the fly-weight of Desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and Pseudoepheals reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacoinetic multi-disciplinary study, which has been carried out with the formulation of a tablet to healthy adult subjects, has been determined that four subjects of desloratadin poorly polluted.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study reveals that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephein after the sole gift of pseudoepheit was equivalent to exposure to gift of a Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on safety sponcology, at the toxicity of repetitive gift, for Genotoxicity and to reproducing stoicity, the preclinical data with desloratadine however does not recognize any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephein.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In repeal xicological studies the combination of Loratadine / pseudoephein was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and on rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogenic.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application has been established and works, before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamika contribute to relieving the allergic symptoms in preventing it that histamine, a body's physical substance, its effect can unfold.</seg>

<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itchiness, number and size of the paddle, impairment of sleep and performance on day) before and after six-week treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were further studies submitted to emulate that the body uses the syrup, the solution for taking and the melt-up in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Asterus led to an average withdrawal of the symptom (symptom score) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patient which received a placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. on the Committee on Human Rights Committee (CHMP) officially distributed that the company adopts its application for approval for the transport of Aflunov to the prevention of aviary H5N1-influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be applied to adults and older people to protect flu that is caused by the tribe (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine being caused in front of a strain of influenza that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Influenza pandemic breaks out when a new tribe of influenza occurs, which can easily spread from man to man because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the immune system contained in the vaccine as a "body-foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">By doing so, the immune system is later able to form in a contact with a prevention of influenza this pedigree.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Then the membrane-envelope of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body is dismissed as body alien), purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">One inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to fulfill the requirements of the EMEA's guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you need to participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment, please contact your doctor doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is applied in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immunoidal anti-virus type 1 (HIV-1) which causes the acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, acts as a solution to deposit, but this cannot be taken along with Ritonavir because the security of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti-viral medicines has been taken before, and the likelihood is judged that the virus will appeal to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which will be taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase is aimed at body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS cannot cure, however, may delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other anti-viral medicines, however without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which previously had not been treated with Proteasia.</seg>
<seg id="1912">This with low doosing Ritonavir increased medicine Agenerase was compared with 206 adults, which had previously taken from protein eased, with other protein eases.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no detectable concentrations of HIV in the blood (virus last) or the change of viral infections after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who previously had no protein eased, had no more patients under Agenerative more patients under 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children decreased Agenerase also the Viral last, however, with the children who had previously been treated with Proteasia, were only very few on the treatment languages.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, who had previously been treated with Proteasia, that was treated with Ritonavir increased medicine Agenerase the Viral last after 16-week treatment as effective as other protein eased:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patient with HIV, which was resistant to four other protein eased, it came under Agenerase along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of the Viral last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protein eased:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Ageneric (observed with more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (blowing), vomiting (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients that may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amagavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase must also not be used in patients who are currants (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are as common as Agenerase and are harmful in high concentrations in blood health harmful.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the Ageneric ystrophy (change in the distribution of body fat), a osteonecliptic (redie of bone tissue) or an immunoactivation syndroms (symptoms of infection that are caused by the restling immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee on Human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat with other antiretroviral medicines to overweigh HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacoinetic amplifier Ritonavir but the committee determined that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who have previously taken no protein eased, is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Agenerase was originally approved under "exceptional circumstances," as at the time of approval for scientific reasons, there was limited information only.</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission adopted the Glaxo Group Limited Limited with an approval for the transport of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is shown in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1- infected, Proteasabmer (PI )-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usual Agenerase capsules should be administered for pharmacoinetic booths of amagavir along with low doses of chionavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amspecavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance and the treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of ameliavir as a solution to insertion is 14% lower than in amagavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for insertion on a milligram per milligram base is not interchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg ameliavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying add-on of Ritonavir (Boosterung), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg ameliavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily intake of 2400 mg amagavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacoinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses from Ritonavir or other protein eases have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years due to the lack of data to unthinkable and effectiveness (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacoinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunctions to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to take care of patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also include substrates of the Cytochrom P450-isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the currants (hypericum perforatum) contain, may not be applied due to the risk reduction of plasma-concentration and a diminished therapeutic effect of amagavir during the intake of amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with asgenerase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Ageneric capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses from Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral combination therapy, have increased risk to severe liver interactions with potentially fatal course.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of these medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with existing limited liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticone or other glucoortikoids that switches over CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of treatment the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of HMG CoA reducer Lovastatin and Simvastatin depends heavily on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathia including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Standards-ratio), are available methods for determining the substance concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">For patients who take these medicines at the same time, Agenerase may be less effective because of reduced plascosavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amagavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills can be altered, however, the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadon is given simultaneously with ameliavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatric symptoms, especially if there is also even low doses administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high probiotic drug content of the Ageneric solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under a age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set for duration 5 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including protein easabmer, has been reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exams of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases, to whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In case of mophile patients (type A and B), which were treated with Proteases, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutters and hamarthroes.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defective therapy, at the time of the introduction of an anti-retroviral therapy therapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual infections develop which leads to severe clinical states or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is accepted (including the application of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, heavy immune-size index), cases of Osteonekrose, in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) reports.</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given simultaneously with drugs which have a low therapeutic width and also include substrates of the Cytochrom P450-isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with Ritonavir must not be given along with medicines whose active ingredients are primarily associated with CYP2D6 and are connected to the increased plasmasgel with heavier and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin has caused a 82% reduction in AUC by amagavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a balance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to compensate the harvested plastic mask by a dose increase of other protein inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, very often unwanted effects on liver have been observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Johannisweeds (Hypericum perforatum) The service level of amagavir can be degraded by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient has already adopts torch, the Amspecavirmirror is and, if possible to check the Viral last and dismiss the currants.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when closeavir is administered together with amagavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, for Cmax on it by 30%, if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with amspecavir capsules (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses were applied twice daily and ritonavir twice daily and konavir 100 mg twice daily, which occupy the effectiveness and unobjectionable of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humiliating when Amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amagavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) can be reached approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosages recommended for simultaneous administration of amagavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to be a engmaschige monitoring because the effectiveness and unthiness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacoinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosin combination, but is recommended due to the antasia component of Didanosin, that the income of Didanosin and Agenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, at the gift of Efavirenz, in combination with ameliavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amagavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protein easiness would be degrading.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin to other proteasiness and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may lowers serum concentration of amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used simultaneously, caution is advisable because Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased / possibly subtherapeutic masculine.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are applied together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amagavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of ameliavir and rifabutin led to a rise in the Plasmakonzentration (AUC) of Rifabutin um 193% and thus to an increase in with rifabutin connected side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin, along with Agenerase to administer, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half the recommended dose, though no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacoinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin were not conducted, however, the plasmasgel of both drugs could be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosameliavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once a day led to an increase in Cmax of Ketoconazole in plasma on 25% and AUC (0 points) to $200 mg Ketoconazole once a day with no simultaneous application of Fosamspecavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, Hemmer or induction of CYP3A4, can if they are applied together with Agenerase, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with asgenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protein easiness, it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as Agenerase because it can come to residue disorder.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anti-convulsiva, known as encycloductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amagavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasmasavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium canals, such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by ampspecavir, which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous intake with Agenerase can enhance their plasma-centrations and reinforce with PDE5 inhibitors in connection related side effects including hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days at Probanden have been significant, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">"" "" "" "as a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase is not recommended together with these Glukokortikoids, unless the potential benefits of treatment is the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA reductants such as Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, the increases of plasmasons are expected to be expected while receiving Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plastic increases this HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathia including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of this medicine is not recommended with ameliavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be recommended a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilize the mirror, as the plasma-concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by conglomeration of amagavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase must not be applied together with oral biased midazolam (see section 4.3), while at the simultaneous application of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other protein easors point to a possible increase in the plasmasons of Midazolam around the 3- to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with ameliavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opiatric symptoms, especially if there is also even low doses administered by Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the per se small reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given as the speckled dose is to suit when Amspecavir is administered simultaneously with methadon.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With current gift of warfarin or other oralen anticoagulants, along with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Normally Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of depreciation or reinforcement of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not presetable, therefore as well as alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended in the simultaneous gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful abortion of possible usage for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk-activated rats, Amspecavir-related substances have been proven, however, it is not known whether amagavir is overflowing with humans into the mother's milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of repainly rats, which was administered from the intimidation in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period of amagavir, showed during the lactation a diminished increase in the 12 body weight in the afternobility.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the descendants including fertilability and reproductive capacity was not affected by the submission of amagavir to the mother tier.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The unthiness of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the associated side-effects associated with the Agenerase-related side effects were slightly to moderate, occurred early and resulted in a rare treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether in connection with the intake of Agenerase or other medicines applied to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the listed side effects are from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients treated with proteased patients received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4), which were developed by the investigator as in connection with the study medication and were performed with more than 1% of patients, as well as in the treatment laboratory changes (degrees 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral therapy therapy has been associated with redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) with HIV-patients, including a loss of peripheral and faunal fat tissues, increased intraoperative and visceral fatty tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsozery fat collection (embroideries).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretro, not pre-treated individuals who were treated with amspecavir in combination with Lamivudine / Zidovudine on a medium duration of 36 weeks was only observed (breastfeeding) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients under amspecavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) with 241 patients under Indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs for a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin balances were usually slightly slightly shaped, erythemous or makulopapully nature, with or without itchiness and occurred usually during the second treatment week, and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks, without the treatment with ameliavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of Osteonekrose has been reported especially in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defective therapy, at the time of the introduction of an anti-retroviral therapy therapy (ART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual infections develop (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretrospectroscopy (one of 25 isolates), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), inviolavir / kzavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), Saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / konavir (4 out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, amestavir reserves his activity against some other proteased-resistant isolates; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early release of an overwhelming therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations in boundaries which can affect the following treatment properly.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The testament of the effectiveness of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomised open study (600 mg twice daily) and Nucleosidana (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dosing Ritonavir. "received.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-six (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the sub-study A by PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis presented the non-undermine of APV / Ritonavir in comparison to the SOC-PI group with regard to the time period (AAUCMB) in the Viral last (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-lower threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The proof of the effectiveness of unbundled Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerative resolution has been evaluated three times a day, 20 mg / kg every day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby most of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosire Ritonavir simultaneously; the majority of those treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of the patients included a plasma-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Basics of this data should be considered in the treatment optimization with PI pre-treated children who will be considered to be expected to be expected by "unbundled" Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum service concentration of amagavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5-1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increases, for Cmax against 30% reduced, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) together with ameliavir (600 mg twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of ameliavir with a meal leads to a 25% reduction in AUC, but has no effect on concentration of ameliavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore the minimum concentration in the steady State (Cmin, ss) remained ininfluenced by the food intake, although the simultaneous food intake influenced the scale and rate of Resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be placed on a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of ameliavir from the blood circulation in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the drug in plasma, with the amount of unmatched amagion, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unmatched amestavir remains constant, fluctuates the percentage of free active ingredients during the dozation intervalls in dependence on the overall medication-centration in the Steady-State over the area of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines to induce the CYP3A4 or make inhibiting or a substrate of CYP3A4, with caution when they are given simultaneously with Agenerative (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily agion avir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Speckled is less biocompatible from the solution of 14% than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Ageneric capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrams.</seg>
<seg id="2053">It is also negligible for the renal clearing of Ritonavir, therefore the impact of a renal function is likely to be low on the elimination of amagavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemata lead to Amspecavir-plastic, comparable to those that are achieved at healthy probanden after a dose of 1200 mg amagavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on cancery with amagavir on mice and rats occurred in males's enigne hepatoellular adenome at doses, which spoke to the 2.0-times (mice) or 3.8- times (rat) of exposure to the people, after twice daily gift of 1200 mg amestavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hepatocative ome atoms and carcinoma has not yet been explained and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">From the present exposure data on people, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, however, there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro-genius tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel-test of human peripheral lymphocytes contained, Amspecavir was neither mutiny nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">These liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Up to now, clinical studies have not been observed yet any significant liver toxicity in patients, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies for toxicity in juveniles, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed both the control and the speckled animals treated with amagavir-treated animals.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In a systemic plasma exposure, which was significant under (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) as the expected exposure to human subjects, however, a number of minor changes including thymuselongation and minor skeletal changes were observed which point to a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying add-on of Ritonavir (Boosterung), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg ameliavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily intake of 2400 mg amagavir that should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be carried out in patients with relapse or mild liver dysfunction with caution, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring the International Standards-ratio), are available methods for determining the substance concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amagavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) can be reached approximately 40 to 50% lower than when Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosages recommended for simultaneous administration of amagavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended to be a engmaschige monitoring because the effectiveness and unthiness of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amagavir and Saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protein easiness would be degrading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are applied together, caution is commanded; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be made, as an exact prediction of the effect of the combination of amagavir and Ritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons, rifabutin, along with Agenerase to administer, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half the recommended dose 31 at least, though no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="2076">The serum concentrations of calcium canals, such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Nisoldipin and Verapamil can be increased by amagavir, which potentially increases the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical trial, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules two times daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4-times daily) over 7 days at Probanden have been significant, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidenzinterval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With current gift of warfarin or other oralen anticoagulants, along with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Normally Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of depreciation or reinforcement of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg Ethinylestradiol plus 1,0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin by Amspecavir by 22% in charge.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this medicine may only be used after careful abortion of possible usage for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of repainly rats, which was administered from the intimidation in the uterus until the end of the breastfeeding period of amagavir, showed a diminished increase in body weight during the breastfeeding period.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The unthiness of Agenerase has been studied in adults and children from 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In the case of an overdose, the patient is based on signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, the necessary support measures are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of amagavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both acute and chronic lymphotic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as also peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) of Amspecavir is located in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in acute cells and amounts 0,41 µm in chronic infected cells (1 µm = 0,50 µg / ml).</seg>

<seg id="2309">In most patients, it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a seroconversion, whereby the patients aged under the age of 5 came to a Serge trial (on an average of 26 days compared to 45 days with patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the Phase 3 study (or until a premature retirement from the study), in 13 / 45 patients there were no proven antibodies to, including 3 patients, in which it has never come to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of ocular mirror resulted in a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the harn, while in patients with high antibodies, a variable reduction of GAG in the Harn was ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase-2 study) showed a marginal until low neutral effect on enzymatic Laronidas- activity in vitro that seemed to not affect clinical effectiveness and / or reducing GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed to be linked to the incidence of unwanted drug interactions, even if the appearance of undesirable drug interactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into the lysosomes, most likely about Mannosis-6-phosphat- receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme were examined in a randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled phase-3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients from Middle phenotype and only a patient showed the serious phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forciated expirator volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FEV and the absolute walking distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extensions study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>

<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) of CTC degrees 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematological toxicity (except neurotoxicity), the therapy with ALIMTA has to be interrupted, until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be broken down when in patients after 2 dosage reduction, a hematological toxicity or non-hematological toxicity of 3 or 4 occurs or so- fort at the appearance of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients at the age of 65 of age or in comparison to patients aged under 65 years of age, an increased sales risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to not sufficient data to unthinkable and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials in patients with a creatine-Clearance of 445 ml / min, no dosage adjustment necessary to go beyond the dosage adaptations for all patients recommended dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatine-Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2391">A dose-reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute Neutrophilenzahl, Thrombozytente and maximally non-ugly toxicity, such as it has been observed in the previous treatment cycles - the (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of dematological toxicity such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenie was beamed when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients need to be reliant with petrexed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure for reduction treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used for chemotherapy and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapy, which are excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin or Carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by the additional gift of a corticosteroids (a drug which can be used as an antiemetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as to the effects in this age group does not exist enough information.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient is the attachment of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin) to the receptors in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies at 1 842 adults, the chemotherapy regimens who are strong or excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting are 59% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (132 from 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting are, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi, in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron treated patients (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">For a comparison with Dolasetron these values include 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 by 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission shared the Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. a permit for the acquisition of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicative: to the prevention of acuated nausea and vomiting with strongly emetoed chemotherapy due to cancer disease and to prevent nausea and vomiting with moderate chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for prevention of nausea and vomiting that is induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be reinforced by adding a corticosteroids due to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonotron can extend the Dickdarmpassage, patients should be supervised with anamnesty obliteral or signs of a subacute Ileus after the injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advisable at the current gift of Palonotron using medicines that prolongs the QT interval or in patients with which the Q- interval prolongs or which are inclined to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In the days of chemotherapy, Aloxi is to be used neither for prevention nor treatment for treatment of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonotron is not the targeted activity of the five subjects of chemotherapy (cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin, and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial, no significant pharmacoinetic interaction between a unique intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a stealing-- concentration oralen Metoclopramids, one of CYP2D6 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population based pharmacological analysis, Celecoxib, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, Cimetidin, neonavir, sertralin and terbinafin) had no significant impact on the Clearance of Palonotron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the use of Palonotron in human pregnancies do not lie before, therefore Palonotron should not be applied in pregnant women unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms of observing side effects (a total of 633 patients), which at least stood with Aloxi in connection, headaches (9%) and Obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of surplus-sensitive actions and reactions to the administration (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were given in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest doses showed similar frequencies of undesirable events such as in the other metering groups; there were no dose-active relationships to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">There were no dialysis studies carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably no effective therapy for aloxification.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients, which received a moderate emetogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2, cyclophosphorubicin and 250 mcegtron (half-time 4 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.3 hours), which was given to day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind experiment, a total of 667 patients, which received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with over 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1.500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazin, as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of Palonosetron, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron that were given to 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with ocratic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonotron was comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the QTc intervalls with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonotron possesses the ability to block the Ionencanals and repolarization of the Ionencanals and extend the duration of the potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out by 221 healthy participants in the study was the assessment of the EKG effects of i.V. administered Palonotron in single pants from 0.25, 0.75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous gift follows a initial elimination of the plasma-centrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrations of the time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous gift from Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average mean (± SD) increase in Palonotic (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron-Plasmakonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacoinetic simulations indicate that once a daily intravenous gift of 0.25 mg Palonotron was comparable with that after unique intravenous administration of 0.75 mg; however, the Cmax was higher after the entry of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% will be eliminated by the kidneys, and about another 50% will be converted into two primary Metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on the metabolic isation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, the isophic CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 has been involved in the Metabolism of Palonotron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous subdose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonotic tron have found approximately 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonotron as unaltered active ingredients made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a unique intravenous spection with healthy was the total-body-totalling 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver dysfunction the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to palonotic fluid increases, a reduction of the dose is therefore not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical trials, effects were observed only after expositions which can be considered sufficient about the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From prehistoric studies revealed evidence that Palonotron can only block in very high concentrations of Ionencanals, which are involved in ventricular De- and repolarization and can extend the potential for action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses Palonosetron (each dose uncovered in about the 30le of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumors, endocracks, pancreas, tripenmark, and skin tumours by rats, but not on mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doings and since Aloxi is intended for a unique application, the relevance of these results is assessed as low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed concern that the data for the stability of the substance and the pharmaceutical drug has not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C related to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon flamming the disease with more patients back on than with the reference pharmaceutics; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from that, in the study, the test has been investigating the question to what extent the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be applied to the treatment of impetigo (a combination of cratic skin infection) and small infected ingences (risk or careless), depleted and gendered wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by methicillingenoccus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this kind of infections may not affect.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under the age of 18 may not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not address the patient after two or three days, the doctor should investigate the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial giant cells (the parts of the bacterial cell that proteins be produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was delayed by the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo pretend to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hautwunden, Altargo and cefalexine showed similar contact: if the results of both studies were taken together in Hautwunden, about 90% of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">However, in these two studies, however, that Altargo was caused by the treatment of abscesses (failed hollow in the body tissue) or of infections that have been proven to be proven or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Altargo in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections over the risks are outweighed: • Impetigo, • infected small ingences, depledges or gendered wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission shared the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the intraffic of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with which no improvement within two or three days are likely to be investigated once more and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation through the use of Retapamulin Salintment, the treatment is broken down, the obe carefully deducted and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection began.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogens or is believed (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials in secondary open wounds, the effectiveness of retapamulin was caused by patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2-day treatment, no improvement or a deterioration of the infected position occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous application of retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been investigated and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low Plasmakonzentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on shopped skin or infected superficial wounds, is a clinically relevant imitation in vivo not to be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After current gift of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the middle retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax to topical application of 1% Retapamulin Salbe on the skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosisadaptations are not necessary for necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproducing stoicity after oral intake and are inadequate regarding a statement regarding the birth and fateful / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Reapamulin Salbe should only be applied during pregnancy when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicative and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to preach the gift of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>

<seg id="2698">There is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a particular ties of the 50s subunit of the bacteriological Ribosom, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal intermittent antibacterial fabrics.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the bonds of Bosnian Protein L3 is involved and in the region of the ribosomal P-bindings and the Peptidyltransfering centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Due to the bond of this bond of inhibiting Pleuromutiline the Peptidyltransfer, block some P-bond interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomaler sub-units.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If the application of reapamulin should be applied to the application of Retapamulin at least some infection-forms, a consultation should be pursued by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of failure to treatment at S.aureus, the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>

<seg id="2724">Ambirix will be applied as part of two doses existing vaccines, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason Ambirix can only be used when the immunization consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccine can be led out of two doses.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix can be given Ambirix or another Hepatitis A- or -B vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), "as it can defend against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens than "foreign" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the vaccination Twinrix vaccine since 1997 and the vaccine Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of one out of three doses existing vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also as proof of the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody tially one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>

<seg id="2740">If a refreshed chimage is desired for hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B, can be vaccinated with the corresponding monoval vaccines or with a combination.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-Hepatitis B and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-Hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies lie in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monoval vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured, whether immunocompetent individuals who have addressed on a Hepatitis A- vaccine, a refreshed chimist as protection might be protected as they are also in no longer detectable antibodies possibly protected by immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injections, in the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction, the corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a fast protection against hepatitis B is required, the Standardimping scheme is recommended with the combination-simple, the 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg recombinantes hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In Pomodialysis patient and persons with disturbances of the immune system, under certain circumstances, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies are not reached, so that in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intraoral injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal implication, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">At Thrombozytopie or blood-sensical disorders, Ambirix can be injected into subcutaneous problems, as it can come to bleeding in these cases after intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix was given in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphther-, teellular bezzanine and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with a combined Masernut vaccine vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was adequate (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients suffering from immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective, it has to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was conducted with 3 vaccines of this wording in adults was the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in the former Thiomersal- and preservatives.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical studies, 2029 vaccines were administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maternity in a computation rate per vaccine, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the Gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the promoters observed, compared with 39,1% in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the entire vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the promoters, the Ambirix had received, about pain, compared to 63.8% with the subjects that had been vaccinated with the 3-Dos- combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of Maternity was comparable to a props (i.e. over the entire vaccine with 39.6% of the promoters, which were Ambirix compared with 36,2% in the promoters, which received the 3-doses combinant).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency weighted pain and maternity was small and comparable to that was observed after administration of the combinant vaccine with the 3-doses vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study at 1- until 11-year vaccine was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3-doses combinable with 360 ELISA units formalinactivated carbon-A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11- Jolds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a frequent appearance of pain (at the injection) per dose, not per promoter, reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations which reported on heavy side effects during the 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination-simple with 360 ELISA- units formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis-B- surface excuses, was statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials, which were conducted at vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconversions were for anti-HAV 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconvert rates for anti-hbs were 74.3% a month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second, for month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- until including 15-year-old, 142 two doses received Ambirix and 147 the standard combinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">For the 289 persons, whose immunochemistry was priverable, the Seroproteduction rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3-dosage substance is significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response that were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1- to 11-year-old one month after completion of the full vaccine (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccination were either a 2-doses vaccine with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination-simple using 360 ELISA units formalinactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">Persons, who were at the time of the Grundimmunization between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after immunisation with Ambirix in the 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunogation campaign against both antigens was comparable to that which was established after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination simple, consisting of 360 ELISA units formalinactivated Hepatitisan A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- including 15-year-old could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies can be compared 24 months after immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">When the first dose of Ambirix starts at the same time with a refreshed diphthermic, tearism, azellular Pertussus, inactivated politic vaccines (DTPa-IPV / Hib) or with the first dose of a combined measles-mumps of the vaccine vaccine, the immune response was sufficient to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation of similar seroproteders and seroconverting rates as for the earlier formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is both before and after the resuspening per eye on any external particles and / or physical visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines the Ambirix can protect not completely from an infection with hepatitis or Hepatitis B virus, even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccines or hepatitis B / or hepatitis C (although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick), a vaccination may not prevent a vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content to effective components is usually administered one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine against termination of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will suffer from persons who suffer from severe bloodstream disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle tissue. • if you / your child is weakened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body resistance, or if you / your child undergo a tick-alysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these persons to vaccination may not be sufficient, so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction is on vaccination.</seg>

<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix should be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the response to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix Swan or breastfeeding women will not be administered unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has become known since issuance of the first approval for the intraffic process, the CHMP appeared that the value-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix has only been launched in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">NSC 631570 can also be used in patients aged over a month with incompleted enzyme defective or with hypammonical encephalopathy (brain) as a result of high ammony concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee on Human therapeutic agents (CHMP) reached the conclusion that amorphan in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be effectively prevented from the urinary cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Amicaps has been approved under "exceptional circumstances," because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients in which a complete enzyme deficiency have already manifested in the newborage bracket (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifactual form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests after the first months of life) then there is an indication for use when in the Anamnical encephalographic Encephalopathy.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with eggs, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="2817">After previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of Natriumphenylyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of 20 kg and in growing and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early maniac lack of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with a Argininosappuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0,4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered with eggs, as a risk for the emergence of Ösopranulcera exists when the tablets are not immediately coming into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium yylyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as with Natriretention, and oil-shuffle patients only with caution.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Da Metabolishing and excretion of sodium phenylyrat over the liver and the kidneys, AMMONAPS should be used only with liver or kidney failure, only with extreme care.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous gift of phenylacetate at young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of the neural multiplication and a increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is eliminated by humans into the mother's milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients stood at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of these undesirable events was assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (1 / 10 / 10), common (1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year old anortic patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactattoo, severe hypokaline, corytopia, periphery neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of an overdose entered a 5 month old baby-child with a cute single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limit administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose-limiting neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active connection that ranks through acetamine with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically saw phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram biased naturoylbutylyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is provided early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the survival prospects and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the earliest maniac form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inflicist, and the disease carried itself with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids, or with their sticking-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Through Hamodialysis, the exploitation of alternative paths of nitrogen excretion (sodium polyphenylacetate), proteinated Kost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to diagnose the survival-rate of newborn with postpartal (however within the first months of life) diagnosed in 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and the survival rates were treated before the initial appearance of a hypermetammontic encephalopathy, but even in these patients there was time with many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late maniac form of the condition (including feminine patients with the heterozygotes form of ornithintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperammontic encephalopathy and then permanently treated with sodium polyphenylyrat and a proteinreduced diet was the survival rate 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that Phenylbutyrat to phenylacetate is oxidized in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is created.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and his metabolites were obtained in sober healthy adult and in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle, and with liver cirrhosis, as well as repetitive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after intravenous gift of sodium and phenylacetate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After a oronal single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutylyrat in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic concentrations of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary imbalances or hemosglobeopathies (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) the next morning after nocturally fasting no phenylacetate is detectable in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which have repeatedly been treated with sodium polyphenylyrat (20 g / day oral in three single pants), the medium phenylacetate concentred on the third day were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conical product phenylacetylglutamine about the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of Micronucleus tests, Natriumphenylyrat with toxic and non-toxic doses had no enclagenic effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who have not swallow tablets or patients with eggs) or over a Gastrostomieschl or a nostride.</seg>

<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early maniac lack of carbamylphosphatsynthetase or ornithintranscarbamylase, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS Granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram Natriumphenylbutyrat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g Natriumphenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>

<seg id="2856">A likely toxic response to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year old anortic patient which developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactattoo, severe hypokaline, corytopia, periphery neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically saw phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the excretion of excess of surplus value.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disturbances of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram biased naturoylbutylyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine nitrogen are produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in treatment, and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of neurological condition.</seg>

<seg id="2883">While PCI has often been a Stent (a short tubes, which remains in the Arctic, to prevent a lock), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - in case of preventing new events (deaths, seizures or revascularization) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients suffering from an PCI, angiox was just as effective as yeast in relation to all indicators, except in severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients that may possibly be hypersensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudine, other miludine or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as with people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or infection-infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee on Human Rights (CHMP) reached the conclusion that angiox at the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a removable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission adopted The Medicines Company UK Ltd approval for the intraffic of angiox throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute Koronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / non - ST-Hebrides attack (IA / NSTEMI)) for an emergency attack, or if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended Initialdosis of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous type of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If patient is conducted in further form a PCI, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After PCI according to clinical requirements the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h are taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately before the procedure should be administered by 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with an PCI consists of a initials intravenous type of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a result of immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolt-gift of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to under 225 seconds, a second type of bolt should be carried out of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicines should be carefully mixed before use and the Bolusdosis quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, another monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1.75 mg / kg Infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to an PCI (whether with Bivalirudin against ACS or not), should be used to lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Lies the ACT-value below 225 seconds, is a second studdose of 0.3 mg / kg to administer and the ACT 5 minutes after the second studdose is again examined.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which resulted in phase III- PCI-study (Replace-2), which were included in the approval was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dosage adjustment at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients is angiox-contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intravenous gift of unfractional heparin or 8 hours following the subcutaneous gift of lower molecular entities.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active ingredients or other components or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased blood disorder due to a disturbance of hemostasesystems and / or irreversible endocarditis. • heavy renal damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment of symptoms and signs of a bleeding particularly when Bivalirudine is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even when using PCI-patients under Bivalirudine, most bleeding may occur to arterial punctuation, in patients who occur on a perkutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, should be considered to be monitoring the INR advertising (International Normally ratio), to ensure that the value of treatment with Bivalirudine will be reached again prior to the treatment existing level.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytika or Thrombozytensionshemmer) can be assumed that these agents increase the blood danger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of Bivalirudin with thymus aggregationshemania or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological skins parameters are regularly scrutinized in each case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal studies are inadequate with regard to the effects on pregnancy, the embryonic / fetal development, the delivery or postnatal development (see below Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomized to Bivalirudine alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitors and 4603 were randomized to either unquestionable yeast or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIA inhibitors.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleeding occurred under Bivalirudine alone significantly less frequently than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-inhibitors and Biuprodin plus GPIIb / IIIa- inhibitors (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding has been defined as one of the following events: intraoperative, retroperitoneal, intraoperative or surgical intervention required, hematoriental blood pressure, armination of the hglogloomy mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood lines, reoperation due to a blood pressure, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently watched blood localities that occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctuation, gastroitoneal, gastroses, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudin with 6000 patients who undergo a PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs ordered in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine will immediately break down and the patient is tightened with regard to the signs of a bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudin, a direct and specific trobiness inhibitor that binds both at the catalytic center as well as in the ionic bindings region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombine is tied in the liquid phase or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudine at Thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because Thrombine splits on the one hand the bond of Bivalirudine-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thereby causing the function of the active center of thyrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudin with serum of patients, in which it had come in the past to heparininduzated Thrombocytic syndrome (HIT / HITTS) to induce no Thromboytes-Aggregational reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy probanden and in patients Bivalirudine shows a dosis- and concentration-dependent anticoagulation effect which is supported by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI has been carried out below an PCI, an additional bolt from 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery to be increased to 1,7mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, unquestionated Heparin or Enoxapartheid was administered in accordance with relevant guidelines for the treatment of acuated coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / non-ST-Hebrides (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra will be used to treat adults, young people and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or as a continuous fusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce sufficient insulin to regulating the glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or may not process the insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulinglulisin differs very slightly from Humaninsulin and the change means that it affects faster and a shorter period of time has a short-effective Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between 4 and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type-2 diabetes, in which the body insulin cannot be effectively processed, Apidra was examined in a study with 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance glycosyulated hemmoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adult-1 diabetes was determined after six months a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin per.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes the reduction of the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with humanem normal ulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Approra may not be applied to patients who may possibly have hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin, or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for approval for the intraffic of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal ceiling, the thigh, or the delimcle to use subcutaneous infusion or subcutaneous infusion in the area of pancreas.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and the diminished insulin delivery, the insulin need of insulin in patients with a restriction of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the effectiveness, the brand (Her-), of insulin (normal, NPH, galvanizing, etc.), the type of insulin (animal ulin) and / or the production method can undergo a change in insulin delivery.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A inadequate dosage or the demolition of treatment, particularly in patients with an insulin-duty diabetes, may lead to a hyperglycaemia and a diabetic converter; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may make a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycaemia depends on the substance profile of the insulin and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that can increase the bloodshed activity and reinforce the inclination to hypoglycemic, angiotensin converter, fibrous, Fluoxetine, Fluoamin-Oxidase (MAO) -Hemmer, Pentoxifyllin, Propoxyphen, Salizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytic, such as betablockers, Clonidin, Guanethidine and reserpin the symptoms of adrenergen counter-regulation be weakened or missing.</seg>

<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemic with consciousy can be treated by a intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5 to 1 mg), which is given by a physician, or treated by intravenous gift of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a glucose infection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the prize- cause for the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscle and fat) as well as by the imitation of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous food of insulin delivery occurs faster and the active time is shorter than at hugmanem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type-1 diabetes melli- tus insulin is a dose-proportionate therapy capacity, and with 0,3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase of glucose impact, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin has twice as fast as normal humaninsulin and achieves the complete glucose level of approximately 2 hours earlier as Humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data was apparent that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable postprandical glycemic control is achieved as with humanem normal ulin, which is given 30 minutes before meal.</seg>
