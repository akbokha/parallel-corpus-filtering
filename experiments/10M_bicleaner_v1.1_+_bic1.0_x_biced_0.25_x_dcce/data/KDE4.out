the package &amp; package includes various modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available .
more information about using &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual too &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; invite settings to set up settings .... Open the box tool@@ kit and select the desired modules .
this is a list of default modules dating from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the package base , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; the crash , or the list of stor@@ ks , if available , delete .
the module &apos;s p@@ age@@ filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ changing filters . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; use the DO@@ M tree to display ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the ad starts with the root notes of the document , example : the element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root canal .
the module &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views to view the content of your local fil@@ esystem .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; consists of portra@@ yed folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is displayed by a rec@@ tan@@ gle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must own the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; the size of a folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected in the folder of the folder . accordingly , &amp; F@@ S@@ View can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you are considered .
in &amp; F@@ S@@ View ; is an entry in the podium representation a rec@@ tan@@ gle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and des@@ crip@@ tive settings .
the color of a rec@@ tan@@ gle that is switched on color mode can either be depth for the slight detection of the tigh@@ tening surface or the illustration of a different file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IME type .
a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can determine if enough space to display or whether the surface of sub@@ ordinate calculations is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rec@@ tan@@ gle .
at Dar@@ ing algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the item . at the podium in &amp; F@@ S@@ View , this goal is not always maintained to represent the tigh@@ ter of entries , and this frame may need space , which is then lost the sub@@ ordinate entries . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rec@@ tan@@ gle square is square .
as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for sub@@ ordinate entries remains the implementation shall be left . here it is for the ri@@ pping and avoiding plac@@ ements by frame always beneficial the surfaces such as square @-@ thickness , which are as square @-@ shaped . the best methods for this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second h@@ asti@@ ly .
you can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu view . instead , a smo@@ k@@ pattern is drawn into the area of the higher order entry to indicate that this area is actually being occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry .
originally , &amp; F@@ S@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ egr@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras : create ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you access the module picture , there will be a dialogue with which you can set the appearance of the gallery .
the option tracks of the page allows you to adjust in a text box the title of the picture gallery page .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a set box to adjust the number of thumb@@ nails each line in the gallery .
display the fil@@ en@@ ame of the picture shows whether the fil@@ en@@ ame will be displayed under the thumb@@ nail in the gallery .
display the file size of the picture by clicking on whether the file size is displayed among the thumb@@ nail in the gallery .
please indicate whether the size of the images is displayed among the thumb@@ nail in the gallery .
in the dialogue folder you place where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML @-@ file you enter where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the cross@@ box sub@@ folder you can switch to a sli@@ der or a set , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
with the tit@@ ular original pictures , please specify whether the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery .
in the commentary box , you can use a commentary file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the An@@ cruci@@ fied shades , you can specify a different color picture for the thumb@@ nails .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings offers you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ;
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

a simple to use camera point will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; Image . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported , supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools . you can use them to comment and correct your photos . the editing skills can be easily expanded with KDE image plug @-@ ins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ tised ; easy to use , it makes use of professional skills at your disposal . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit colour@@ ing and all available modules support the pipe conver@@ gence by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC Manager .
improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens , about which can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ tised ; an open source project . that means it &apos;s dependent on supporting the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; tries to make milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you use this short@@ list , your web browser opens a page in the fault system . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to send your account .
&amp; digi@@ came ; is a project that is supported by a community . i.e. , the user and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; digi@@ tised , then we would like to answer any other users of &amp; digi@@ tised . however , in this mailing list , however , you should be English speaking , you should be powerful this language therefore .
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit news about free versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ tised .
the best start to get involved &amp; digi@@ tized is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ came ; .
when you run &amp; digi@@ tised , for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . just enter a local , remote or remote folder , simply enter the folder name or click the folder symbol to select a folder .
in the second box you need to specify a local folder on your computer . this path is stored for all the image folders .
later you can add a lot of folder as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ came ; will you additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder , the images , as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ tised , each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . during the search of the folder you will get a progres@@ sively showing how to see them :
&amp; digi@@ tised ; dur@@ es recur@@ sively the libr@@ arian in its entire depth . you can not exp@@ el any sub@@ folders , unless it came in a st@@ em@@ med folder . this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
when you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ds have no photos as symbols . you can change the edit photo from the album and take it on the folder symbol . this will then be used as a symbol symbol . further details please find in the section albums .
once you configure the base sub@@ folder you can set up &amp; digi@@ tization . after that , you should learn how to use My albums and My key@@ note list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : in case you use the shell mode of your camera , so it may also handle . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help .
how you set up this and working with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ o@@ der@@ settings and ro@@ h operations .
a simple to use camera point will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; Image . more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader is supported , supported by your operating system , with &amp; digi@@ tised .
modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive . the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may take advantage of the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; use the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital cameras , which is an ever @-@ increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission across the serial port is slow , this connection is now ob@@ sole@@ te . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must be created with li@@ bex@@ if support is required to read the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ tization . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ ale 2 , you might not be able to think about anything or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; digi@@ came ; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I module : the KDE image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ tised ; to create the Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide modules with all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ tised ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ came ; even carry out .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + Shift + F .
the drag and drop of images works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the alp , above the horizontal separation line or another application window . the only restriction is that a picture does not appear in keywords , date list or searching .
- a fil@@ en@@ ary sel@@ ector allows you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that appear in the tool@@ view . thus , the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind the symbol symbol@@ ises . which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of alchem@@ ist .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ lis@@ te@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ box . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ tised , in which they were stored on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ properties or after the date when the album was first created , sorted by the album first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screen shot directly to an album . choose an album Im@@ ported scre@@ enshot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moving through moving or copying . simply select all pictures and move them onto the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection . to access the Alb@@ um@@ properties , you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit it in the context menu of Alb@@ um@@ properties .
Alb@@ um@@ - Collec@@ tions : are a method to highlight your albums so that you can choose from a common name for sorting out your photos , when you select from the tool@@ bar or select View Samples collection . if you add new collections or want to delete , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the Alb@@ um Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date .
the buttons , average , newest : these set the date on the one &apos;s oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . first , first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ tised , the first image is chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; my Al@@ ben@@ lis@@ te@@ quot ; selected . this will help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button , and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wasted .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area my key@@ word list left down in the main window . album collections have another effect . the collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the window window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo will display in a preview , you can watch the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe ball in the tool@@ bar .
if you open an album for the first time , you must wait short while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can re@@ generate the thumb@@ nails in the menu .
information on each picture is shown below the associated preview . what information these are , you can change about settings digi@@ tised ; setup here the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows , the ads . if you leave the mouse @-@ cursor a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot of the top in the section introduction into the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all about what it came at &amp; digi@@ tised . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach all the features that come with &amp; digi@@ tised . you can reach all the functions which are available with &amp; digi@@ tised . you can choose between watching the images , a di@@ asch@@ au or the editing of images .
you can open the image processing with a photo by calling either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or select the context menu of the picture with the right mouse button and Edit ... select a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view your photos and change them .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ tised ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo menu with the right mouse button , and how to adjust the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . to this , and how to adapt to your needs , if your program is not checked , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after the processing of other image processing programs , you should keep problems with the met@@ adata working in the picture . some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , bl@@ ending , etc .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select rotating . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ames of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . please note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you have a photo of &amp; digi@@ tised ; extingu@@ ish it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; if you prefer to del@@ eting , you can do it by using Shift ; withdraw@@ f .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ alog@@ lis@@ te@@ quot ; organizes your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ tised ; used either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
when you choose one month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks at the date sheet in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and catalogue . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this key@@ word or search again .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos , which were marked with this key@@ word .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . here , you can organize your keywords log@@ ically . you can also share parts of the building &amp; quot ; My key@@ word quot ; ) together , so that you can find the keywords which you &apos;re looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and weigh@@ ted key@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . besides , the keywords in case of loss of the database re @-@ imported , once &amp; digi@@ tised ; the images have noticed .
you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; my Stich@@ ting quot ; or to an existing key@@ word click . if you add a new key@@ word after you clicked on an existing folder , it becomes the word @-@ word of this key@@ word .
you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the key@@ word is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keywords by drag it to the desired position in the tree and take a menu that gives you the possibility of moving the key@@ word . a key@@ word can only be in a tree at a time .
you can change the characteristics of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button , and in the context menu , you can edit the name of the keywords , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; my Stich@@ ting quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right button of the mouse button in the context menu . in addition , you can put the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to get out &amp; digi@@ tised ; this functionality provided with keywords , you must first take up your photos with keywords , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; my Stich@@ ting quot ; drag and drop there . alternatively , you can also click with the right button of the mouse click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu button .
you can choose a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords it is available for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event , where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open the right click menu of the photos and select from the keywords menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time depending on the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be postponed via this h@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower calculations of the selection framework , which gives the time unit . thereby , all the associated images are displayed in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and store your selection . then , in the list below .
include all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamp and in the future even more .
Neb@@ end he search box is a small lamp the green becomes if the search results found . if you click here , the fil@@ tering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has nothing found then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ esc@@ ope . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as those described above . you can save this search here but as a live search that &apos;s always fil@@ tered what you &apos;ve typ@@ ed as a search criter@@ ion . after you were saved , he became filters in the list .
when you are satisfied with your choice , press the head OK and the search is carried out . the results are shown in view my search list in the main window . if you want to change your choice after searching once again , you just need to select the appropriate entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form for entering the search again appears with the previous search information . if you choose advanced search , the dialog appears for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for searching for . more information can be found in the section The tool for Exten@@ ded Search .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search .
the extended search provides an expan@@ sive search form with many search parameters available to which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tised ; s database can be found .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are deleted or deleted by operators . any option can be added to others about the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or Mind@@ n ... link . moreover , you can create the type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; character@@ izes every picture by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two image sig@@ natures , the more the match it . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image to find a similar one . by means of a spon@@ ges the result can be enlarged or shr@@ inks . if you push a picture of somewhere over the icon of the un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then you will open up and you can drop it there .
sketch : free and @-@ color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ tised ; find the appropriate pictures . also here a s@@ ell@@ ar can be set .
this rider provides an intuitive dealer @-@ looking tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature order . you can press the mouse button or move it out and move it while you are fil@@ tered out and displayed in this coordinates . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your images of ge@@ o data contained .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ came ; provides a lumin@@ ous in a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image formats , also raw files , together .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em flas@@ tically added from the context menu . the choice will be added to the light table and open the window . if you are back in &amp; Image : main window , you can open the ligh@@ tically quickly with L ex@@ tras .
from the thumb@@ nail you can compare the images you want to compare , in the left or right area of the window . if you preview preview sync out of the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or reloc@@ ations to one of the images then they will also compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited to order quickly from a picture series . if you use pairs of pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically displayed in the ranges at the same time . use the right to be displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal sol@@ dering means also work directly from the light table , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes for example simply visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each range you will find a built @-@ in bowl function , which you can detect on the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you must click this and the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed . in the mode Preview will display both pictures in the same image .
the Zo@@ omen works as well as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom Reg@@ ulators under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zo@@ oming in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures when you are pre@@ viewing in the mode .
what is a digital inventory - away from the mo@@ de@@ word ? digital invent@@ ories , each part of the process follows after the image was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes up , scans or digital photos takes a form of digital inventory . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , we use and use photos again . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , remove , backup , evaluate , stream@@ lined , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archi@@ ved , archiving , and export files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale Enterprise Management takes on , inde@@ xed , categor@@ ized , seeks , transforming , conf@@ ection@@ ated , and exports content that have a monetary or cultural value .
met@@ adata are defined as data on data . met@@ adata are provided in accordance with your definition of data , which will provide information about or manage the documentation provided by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will certainly not use &amp; digi@@ tised . . the approach to store the met@@ adata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast seeking and secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and know before doing something in your system is building up information structure in contrast to data structure . you have to decide whether other access to your photos may want to save on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . notice that you will eventually need to switch to a larger drive .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location . if you were able to use enough pictures , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . then export is a folder for images you want to print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as locking the photos , archiving , working courses , constant intake of images on different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years 95 % Archive and 5 % working files will not be able to organise your structure for this content .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acking processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work@@ files makes a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option to store Met@@ adata in the settings of the met@@ adata in &amp; digi@@ tised . this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change what &apos;s going to change ? then a met@@ adata editor will provide them for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now select any photo keywords , des@@ crip@@ tions and an evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then put the value then . you start with the rating or the ranking . this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now let us know the keywords , keywords as you are frequently called on other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then a problem and can simply insert the tree in the right place . the change of hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are being updated by &amp; digi@@ tised , while the sub@@ trees are persec@@ uted .
the graphics show like different met@@ adata , cut off . this is a very rough representation , as every block of met@@ adata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates properties of all pictures .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to lab@@ eling or comments , the third important tool to catalogue your met@@ adata .
you just want to see most of your photos just plain , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are certainly interested in keeping your photos .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this der Lan@@ de@@ platz of Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the sign@@ ment has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others who look at your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember that the key is the importance to the viewer to help Him over the motif you have moved to understand what you understand .
it is ok if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to act with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tised , you can use as much text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling , you can even export a sp@@ ell@@ chec@@ ker . if you export your pictures into web galleries , then these sign@@ ments will be exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web gal@@ actic system . so you have to tell the story for the opening session .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed .
the possibilities that the ge@@ ol@@ ocation can take advantage are already countless and will be able to open in the future with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ tised , then you can also export c@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to Galler@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Copy@@ left is a word play with copyright and refers to the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the layout page of &amp; digi@@ came ; as information should be depos@@ ited :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . for example , the name of a company or organization can be used , for example , the name of a company or organization can be used . once again , this field does not support com@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author@@ is@@ title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s header ) : associated with the author . examples may be title such as : An@@ ders photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s author , this field must be filled just as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who has to offer the photo . if the photographer is working for a message agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a stock photo , then the group / Agency will offer the image here .
it is important to fill the author and copyright paragrap@@ hs . each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers may delete or change . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ tised ; will provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
topics : record errors , disk breakdown , EC@@ C , transmission defect , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this kind of loss are the same which can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TR@@ ACK , the biggest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , you need to be treated more careful and you may not last longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also store CDs and DVDs into archives . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe this is in your im@@ measurable room .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk in which you are using good discs and good recording equipment . the best DVD shooting devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it turns the right choice .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to fault , even if you have just written it . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the format@@ ting and the control environment . despite this massive protection they require by chemical aging , Ultra@@ chro@@ o@@ let@@ tes light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called iso@@ bu@@ ster which apparently causes wonder at CDs and DVDs . it works under Windows and &amp; Linux ; it is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks , hard drives , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to save the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs , of course also for Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording of high quality media in a not propri@@ ated format . read then the data again with a description , date &amp; author passwords and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and above animals protected place . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media .
disco@@ the@@ ters retain your statistics for itself . your manufacturer &apos;s circular cover a new disk , but not the data . Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives : flo@@ ppy study
shortly : Dis@@ ks keep on the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ament of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . electronic parts of Contro@@ llers are increasing the most common error . some of SM@@ ART errors announce the immediate exp@@ ir@@ ation . these are especially readers and publishers . the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is just the complete loss of loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electricity failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can normally restore without big problems .
while most electrical devices don &apos;t account much , that can take heavy damage when devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause severe damage . on your computer these anom@@ al@@ ies can cause per@@ tin@@ ted key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware replacement , destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the in@@ avo@@ ids that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against electricity tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absorbed a part of energy @-@ heat and the rest is f@@ lown . it is usually available in the form of a stand @-@ bar . but remember that not every Ste@@ cker@@ bar contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning bolt and thus protects the properly connected devices .
as an over@@ voltage each cable can use to your computer , you should be sure that also all peripher@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and wire mo@@ de@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage ment@@ ee that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television card .
if you have an emergency , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore contain very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for the road .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system will protect your system before smaller fluctu@@ ations in the electricity lines , it will help you with a complete failure . even an exp@@ iry of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in investing free power supply .
apart from the protection against over@@ tension , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a black@@ out occurs . some models allow them to even continue to work until the stream is running . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are filled the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting .
concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security in electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can you get up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference when you consider it &apos;s just a small price difference when you consider it &apos;s just a small price difference . to conclude , you should always think all the cables to separate before you go to the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that you can store any amounts of data .
they are in comparison with the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ atively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . the professional version provides you more , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get un@@ restricted memory , which should be checked only in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically added thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies it is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs face at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely .
the worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission defect has occurred until you open a photo to one day and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems to have thought of it in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within data streams . in normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ F@@ S from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two Candi@@ dates available on a low level and can be scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs system system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the core .
under@@ estimate this not ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % in workplace @-@ operating systems . for not@@ ebooks , the percentage of the theft of 50 % is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the most people think . it leads to a lower damage than theft or new install@@ ations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no longer has been sighted .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , N@@ TF@@ S is minimal better than EX@@ T@@ 3 , rout@@ ing , J@@ F@@ S and X@@ F@@ S to name the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corro@@ bor@@ ated data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this advancement . sensitivity and smoking characteristic for all kinds of lighting sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality op@@ tics are the Optim@@ um for compact cameras . even D@@ SLR cameras have their border with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
so you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro . so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , you can find your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates , or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment .
a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft gap : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they normally affect an entire room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ires does not always mean a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the staircase , into the neighboring building , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite safeguarding the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy of a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the full backup and the last differenti@@ als .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . produces several times . you can restore the original status at any time to which a backup was made . this backup comes up to a version@@ ing system next with the exception that it is only sealed and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmission files copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security about ssh .
secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or another op@@ tic medium .
this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time you come up for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work@@ files . in the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , affiliated X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ adata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet .
to make valuable images the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in helping you remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed :
since the future due to your nature is un@@ predictable , you need to look at everything today . unfortunately , there is no other option to be compatible with caution . all 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards . the less variants you have used in the past , the more easily it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the professional pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means to enlarge .
let &apos;s assume that you plan the scal@@ ability with plans and the area they want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them one .
s / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and re@@ movable &amp; Dollar ; res@@ ize@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ movable if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier by year to year .
gif is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard developed by G@@ IF . however , it is possible to save X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and slow compression . this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression salt ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata . a handful of camera controllers is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nik@@ on will also use it at some time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology ; a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored by the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to be a original shot of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP adds up to problems when linking between the met@@ at@@ end@@ ate@@ i and the image file , and as it can be noted above , you should think if you use DN@@ G as containers and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organisation supporting for fully compatible online met@@ adata management , working in a wide range of applications and modelling , discussions and joint work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI labour groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tened efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the c@@ ame@@ dium , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; digi@@ tised , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these have circumstances be cut off from the other programs .
use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to Web@@ g@@ aler@@ ien , co@@ ded in MPEG , use in contact blades , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ tised . in the section we add photos to an album you can add a description , you can add to your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ tized ; connect them with the computer , turn the camera onto the display mode , and turn it up . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ el indicator at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails will be displayed on the camera . some cameras do not show thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file files displayed for each file , photos , movies , music etc . on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information about each entry . with the margins properties and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an item or met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photographic information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras are not available for all information .
the rider Met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturing , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata side@@ bar on the main window of &amp; digi@@ tised ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata are not available with some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ tised . when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired setting methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download un@@ chosen . the chosen button download is long as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . these images have not yet been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ tised . in this case , the new pictures with a star in the thumb@@ nail marks . if you choose this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
when you can download or download the buttons , a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed in which the photos are stored . the list of the existing albums will be displayed , such as regular folder , you can read in the section My albums . then select the target album out of the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ tised ; invites the photos of the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once by using the button Dele@@ te All delete . if you only want to delete a few , you must select this first and then delete er@@ asing .
note that there is no possibility to restore photos from the camera to restore . so , the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; if you want to completely delete them from the camera ; if you want to completely delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera store , because this is much faster .
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly expres@@ sive name . this can result in double fil@@ en@@ ames in case you load photos of different steps in the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirror @-@ based sub @-@ based sub @-@ color . if you use this last option , automatically a folder per day is created .
the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options which are done before the photos on the record are stored . the first two concern the data on the author in the section standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish to use another date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % % H : % M : % S : % S : % S . place the option date &amp; time out . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters . or in major case if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tised ; for a photo is used , the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; may use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time of recording , to carry out an automatic rot@@ ate during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in section side@@ bar met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera did not supply this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch off the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the Autom@@ atic rotation in the bottom of the window .
when your camera records information about the date on which the photo was made available , the photo can be loaded onto the image album . all images with the same date will be loaded onto the same sub @-@ album . all images with the same date will be placed in the same sub @-@ album . you can read all the cameras with the same date . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in this case stores &amp; digi@@ tised ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this , you have to turn this option . use the button Exp@@ and@@ ed at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos of their computer to your camera is the button download . then select a upload . the file op@@ tionally dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files which are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods select .
once the selection has been completed , asks &amp; digi@@ tised , you where the images are loaded highly . select a folder dialog dialog for the camera . select the desired folder and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general concept in this document . it is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude , which can be displayed on a map . identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system .
not only for professional photo@@ grap@@ her , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to carto@@ graphy an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plan@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and property agents can use this ability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was made , you can access a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ tised ; users want to send the location of photographs , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the posi@@ tional data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as the direction , Satt@@ el@@ ites and card@@ boards are supported . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ editing of GPS data and images files using the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and last via manual input of well @-@ known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera , which has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS recipients . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on D@@ SLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract data from images and from GPS . on the following page you can set the same under &amp; Linux ; add : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ like coordinates that are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ google.com is not showing European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; D came ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows . there are many settings to change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised . to set up these settings , you have to set up in the menu settings digi@@ tised . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
this action can be displayed on embedded preview or start editing editing . so that you set the standard behavior of &amp; digi@@ tised , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected for downloading from the camera point . also in database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author@@ is@@ title is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations like e.g. An@@ ders photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this field must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not need to be the author , if this is available for a message agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be the image provided here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the respective IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ s. it is achieved that the met@@ adata permanently contain in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ tised ; these met@@ adata are also available for other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ tised ; imported without lost .
images contained in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you can add to your photos with the images embedded in the pictures . attention : in pictures that already contain s@@ wir@@ es , these are over@@ written by the formation of &amp; digi@@ tised .
the page settings contains all options for the information that appear if the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ tised ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; software came ; indicate which file types of file add and remove . each file in a &amp; photo came ; Alb@@ um@@ folder , which has no of these enh@@ ancements , ignored by &amp; digi@@ tised .
the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button Re@@ fresh to the right of each category .
the settings of the lighthouse of &amp; digi@@ tised ; however , if you then open the light table . however , some images do not open different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the entire picture size lad@@ le quot ; if you have one , then you can get better opinions .
by default , the image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can choose them here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and sub@@ ordinate areas of an image can be marked with darker or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors will be defined here . in picture editing , this observation mode can be installed with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the immediate explanation .
with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , as P@@ NG used a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the images required more time for training and packing . if you have a quick computer , you can set this value to high compression . thereby means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate sal@@ g@@ ums for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality since the De@@ fl@@ ate algorithm is loss of loss @-@ free .
with the setting of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save losses off . even if you choose the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata were not yet supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ tised , the image processing was just an imaging rate for photos . currently , it quickly developed into a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing .
the default output is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixel of the C@@ CD sensor is responding as the pixels with odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option draws the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
when this option is set , the white sli@@ pping from the camera will be used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white is un@@ matched . standard is it a fixed color balance sheet , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that sub@@ ordinate images in four steps get more details in the sh@@ utter . for other cameras , this option will be ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ utter , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the sh@@ utter . use the setting up in different ro@@ ckets . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ utter .
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red proportions of the yet saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a matter how much colour or wh@@ ites you want .
when you choose the option re@@ construct the option you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ate value to your taste . you probably have to put it higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also later be done in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ pack . in order to keep the time for the demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed more conserv@@ atively .
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to extract a complete image from the sub@@ fil@@ tered image , which provides many cameras and which is known as a matrix colour pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour design .
&amp; digi@@ came ; and D@@ cra@@ w represent you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ gene@@ ity ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it also produces colour@@ ing at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue @-@ correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since you will be converted during the use .
a profile transl@@ ates the color formations and gives instructions how these are to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tised ; information like the color formations of a colour space to translate into the other are the colors as accurate as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behaviour issues , if an image is opened in image processing / colour management module with raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
color Profile Set@@ ts here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / / color / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ tised ; analyze this folder then during the start .
settings of ICC profiles you have the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the pipe file .
the colour@@ ing view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are colored not the whole screen .
the input profiles should custom@@ ize you . not all profiles are created for the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color mapping or gam@@ ma correct . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not have to do for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to perform the colour@@ ing mapping yourself .
there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate as your image would be given back to a device . this is very useful before you print the image as your camera and some colors therefore have very saturated . this could manually correct you instead of leaving on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ officially :
the Canon camera expansion leaves the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images and image processing . by providing this interface can &amp; digi@@ tised ; many modules support that were written to cooperate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I module , you can see a list of available modules . select the one you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ tised . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the curtains .
short @-@ command for tasks which can be done by modules , can set in the menu under settings short instructions .
for more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I module you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ ip@@ i @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the hand@@ books of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the Di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ators put the time between the picture crossing , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other cross@@ ings turn the met@@ adata a resp@@ ite from which at the bottom end of the images are l@@ ending during the ad .
the camera features appear on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is connected correctly and in the imaging mode . currently , the platforms are connected , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the bottom end you can put the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / re@@ generate , on which you attach your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; Image , you must connect the camera to your computer , put them into the display mode .
try out if &amp; digi@@ tised ; the camera automatically dete@@ cts . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this will display in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
with the option of confirmation dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ tised ; by del@@ eting a photo in one album . in the sections of del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting a album you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; digi@@ tised ; if you use the option to apply changes to the right side bar without any deduc@@ tions . otherwise , you need to apply the changes with the button changes .
you can also adjust the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tised ; at the starting point , this can be accelerated under the start @-@ up process of &amp; digi@@ tised .
setting up new pictures for new photos , forcing and digi@@ tised to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the starting time from &amp; digi@@ tised . if something from the base sub@@ folder was deleted , asks &amp; digi@@ tised ; you know if it should delete them from the base .
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings allows you to select under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; Image , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or through the context menu of the preview and selection of item ads / editing .
the image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tised . so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in the section picture processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magnific@@ ation factor and the current size picture shows .
a menu bar at the top of the edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , the original photo will change the original photo before you used file saving or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you should make sure to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can save you with file save .
as long as you don &apos;t have stored the photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ oration button or use the button re@@ producing the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last store .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting editing s@@ way or restored by selecting editing reset from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should remember the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the back@@ way and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ envelope @-@ Z to re @-@ establish .
if you choose the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the back @-@ up or re @-@ making button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer press , get a text menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also revers@@ ed or recovered .
once you have started editing editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation button in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have any changes in the current photo you are asked if you want to store them .
you can start in the photo and out of zo@@ oming in which you are using C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : magnific@@ ation factor automatically select
view full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . they come into the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can change this in the setting dialog of &amp; digi@@ tised . you can change this from the &amp; Image window . see this section for setting up the image processing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the menu file and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or entire sentences . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album Ex@@ por@@ tion@@ ers . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions available for the selected images . the same page bar is available , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders are clicked on :
multiple clicking on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
in the des@@ crip@@ tional view , you can input holes with unlimited size or insert . please note the text below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means all special characters are permitted in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to allow you to be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and are shaped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC marking field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented , you can either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the sign@@ ments will then be saved .
besides the App@@ endi@@ x button , there is a button More . with this you can write more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the met@@ adata in the files . however , this will always be performed if you have chosen a met@@ adata adjustment which is always written in the pictures .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting line . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate several images simultaneously , select this out and use the context menu .
the review is written in the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
the keywords review shows a search box for fil@@ tering the keywords , the keywords , and a selection box with the previously shown in this &amp; ... session .
the keywords will be dynam@@ ically adjusted to the search word . you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords may also be set by flag@@ ging of the relevant proportions in the tree . all the keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC @-@ field Key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view , and you will select a key@@ word in the keywords , this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the side@@ bar key@@ note filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , key@@ word and search views . if in addition , one or more keywords will be used on the right , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all sub@@ merged keywords are available .
you can also draw and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected multiple images to provide you with keywords . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and place a dialog , which you asks if you want to put the key@@ word .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keywords will be reduced to three pictures . they were drawn up with C@@ tr@@ l + a and then a key@@ word was drawn from the right t@@ wor@@ e tree to the choice and asks you . a dialog asks whether this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes will take place at every start of the program . it can also be switched on under settings Miscellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that there is one or be , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and control .
( 1 ) : the entry , after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify a detailed search of all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need the cross@@ road at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then see how follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed there ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I used it mainly on &amp; digi@@ tised ; s are concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why one is using a colored workflow , this is the colours used by your camera or scanner to have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographic and scann@@ ed colors . with a colored workflow , you can achieve that the colors can be printed on your monitor from your camera or scanner and that the colours you want to print or publish in the web , publish of your digital dar@@ k@@ room .
when the topic is coming to colour management , everyone wants to know which buttons , he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you can inform you sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you will find links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your image meets all of the criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you will be working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB @-@ colour space . ( further information can be found below )
your only other image documents are via email or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard is standard .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and making life for all so easy , why should one then use another color @-@ space and therefore have thoughts about colour@@ ing managers ?
a visual example of Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB of colour space , tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimension@@ als representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms , so visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om excell@@ ente site and click on info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cold my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ms ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB bul@@ ls or not , you must escal@@ ate your monitor now , because s@@ R@@ GB exceeds your monitor . the cal@@ li@@ bri@@ ation of your monitor has so close the circle . if you work as in the colour space of s@@ R@@ GB , you must use either your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore use it before you try a further manual mach@@ ining .
the functions norm@@ alize the same , automatic deduc@@ tions and contrast expand from the menu cor@@ rigi@@ dity automatic correction automatically try to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method escal@@ ates the lumin@@ osity values over the whole image , so the dar@@ k@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible will change without its color sha@@ ding . this function is often a mag@@ ic correction for images that are dark or washed .
same : this method j@@ us@@ hed the lumin@@ osity factor of the colours of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the Inten@@ sity Canal is as shallow as possible . this makes the same very good results in improving the contrac@@ tion of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful surgery that causes either wonders in one image or destroyed it .
automatic shut@@ down : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green@@ - and blue channel . they determines the dark and bright fron@@ tier and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green@@ - and blue channels on the entire H@@ isto@@ grams .
contrast expand : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible area and a re@@ bo@@ iling of all values in between . this is only visible when watching images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; digi@@ came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ like of a photo .
the white @-@ like correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you are able to perform too far from the original image in the raw mode , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction are better off .
this tool is based on a white @-@ like sal@@ inity that is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it over the menu entry colors white like the image processing .
the thumb@@ nail can be adjusted in size . on the left are both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamic as the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white comparison , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ ers . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel under this mar@@ ker is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
right above will be shown a H@@ isto@@ gram so as soon as you change a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful as soon as you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram has been very helpful even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ aire . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , sati@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shade will be able to enhance the shadow details of your photos or play off .
An@@ stat with the above controls are playing , you should use the color temperature pip@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ load indi@@ k@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel . you will get the combined result in the white point . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as well as loading exactly this . every adjustment of the white balance sheet you can put in a text file and then load them again .
the button pres@@ ets sets all fil@@ tering values again on its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image is changed .
you can set the code samples per color channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ction is the widely used JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ coding is better for high quality images . this coding needs also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ window for the use of colour profiles . a detailed guide to the use of colour profiles can be taken to the section color administration .
another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound correction . this tool allows you to use your settings at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistakes and you therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for the sound correction you will find further information .
a very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you will find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool lab@@ eling effects provides you with four colour effects , a solar system effects , a vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ten@@ filter available .
in times of chemical processing was solar , also Sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of emerged when you were partially developed a short flash light and then merged the development of the image . the result was a partial neg@@ atively negative of the picture . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fin@@ ely .
the intensity controls the solar stabili@@ zation . at about 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase eventually creates a neg@@ ativity that is not based on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that edited ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation that he has a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it easy , he em@@ bell@@ ished many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light bl@@ amed color movie produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ movie . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color but also some photos , especially those that are hardly landscapes ab@@ stain@@ ed too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ st@@ ants . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sh@@ iel@@ ding repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not uncommon to correct the colour counter@@ ast and the lumin@@ osity of the photos . you can try to experiment the different farms of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adju@@ sting you can preview in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
when you get a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem : one too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool Ton@@ worth@@ less to improve the exposure . even if the dialog appears to be very complicated for this tool , you need only the range of sli@@ der . concrete the three sliding below the h@@ isto@@ grams .
the window contains a graphs of intention values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sliding into the clicked , and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture . the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the controller and take care of how the image changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the setting of the image , updated . on the left hand side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the h@@ isto@@ gram is displayed with a linear image or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear display of a single column is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is useful .
three Reg@@ ulators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright notes , and the lowest for middle tones , often called gam@@ ma values .
the three colours pin@@ pet@@ rol can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the entrances , middle and bright notes automatically . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
out@@ puts : the pay@@ outs permit the selection of manual values for each area . here , two regul@@ ators can be used to change the out@@ flow rate , for example , the compression of the exhau@@ st can be used for example . the compression of the pay@@ outs can be used for example to create a slight picture as a background while doing something else in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the images are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the specified values in the file system can be saved and later loaded . it will use the Gimp levels format .
if you use this mode and the three color mou@@ ths , the input will automatically be re@@ generated for all the shade , means and Sundays . activate the paint spra@@ yer you want to use and click the preview of the original image of the h@@ isto@@ grams for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ ator channels .
the over@@ load detec@@ tors controls all shades to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result .
below you can see an example of the alignment of the entrances applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the pay@@ outs are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original is displayed as and the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the options are available :
modifications Channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel which is changed by the module :
besides this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been absorbed with a digital camera is most of the linear mode the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help .
if you move e.g. a cur@@ vent@@ eil to the right , for example the bright notes , then you can see that these bright notes with darker out@@ puts , and which are the associated image pixels darker .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see . if you want to change this markings on the range you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is down to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that you can create is stored in the fil@@ esystem and will be loaded later . the file format is the Gimp tourist format .
if you are using this method and the three shades of paint buttons , you automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and solar disk . activate the paint pip@@ ette that you want to use and click the original image to set the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ ous curve .
the option over@@ load detec@@ tors controls all shades to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ator canal . shadow - and Sundays was set with the paint pip@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of &amp; digi@@ came ; imaging is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colours channel mix@@ er of image processing .
with the Kan@@ al@@ op@@ tionally , you can select the color for the H@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the original area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ ers . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram to display you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are right down : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you can activate L@@ umin@@ ance , as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ mium , the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise which occurs from the color channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ mium conversion in which you reduce the farms first .
the storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender approach allows you to save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the over@@ load detec@@ tors controls all shades to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect at the final result .
below you can see a photo in which blue channel is newly j@@ us@@ hed . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is activated . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step , as color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ er@@ profiles .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good , with all the scenery pictures and fits very well to portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ filmed : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a bar Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
red filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter . this creates a dramatic sky @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ light for daily time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium tones , while he adds a bit col@@ dness in the loop of a pressure and re @-@ development in a sep@@ tum . this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color @-@ image or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture can be used for this .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the image .
a paper text effect is applied to the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool frame can add a decorative setting to be added to an image .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative setting . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ ak eye . under picture frames can add the module from image processing .
type : with this parameter you set the desired fr@@ ment@@ type for your image . passing the picture with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce embr@@ aced it with a thin line and a broad frame ( ideal for black @-@ and white images ) , cooling down it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of ideal for a high @-@ dimensional effect and decorative adds an ornam@@ ental frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited by 1 % to 50 % .
this will be larger than the original , but the original aspect ratio is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool After side @-@ rati@@ os before .
with this practical tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this also goes to several places where you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the color size and the character set . the larger the picture , the larger the character must be . at the end , simply choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished .
each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &apos; OK &apos; . once the image was saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; Image tool ; tool Sch@@ sten@@ one can use a template on an image .
the menu image template used in image processing can be used to put a template on a picture .
for the sten@@ cil , there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation . if you want to add the P@@ NG file format and you should want to add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to remove the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add your sten@@ cil template , send an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; digi@@ tised ; mailing list promptly came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you must put your switching folders with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the Sch@@ ab@@ ov@@ end@@ ales . these settings will be noticed for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree @-@ view , which reflects the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ ner . selecting a folder is updated the thumb@@ nail of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnific@@ ation factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this kno@@ b increases the underlying picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ub : this kno@@ b down@@ sides the underlying picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to change the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired location .
use OK if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; digi@@ came ; three different tools offer to the edge of the edge . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool to raise . it is very fast and easy , but produces , particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ined images .
un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ed mask works at the contrast of edges to look an image shar@@ per . indeed , it works rather a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric dun@@ geon and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require correction of sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be a little blur@@ ring . the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more in@@ toler@@ ating than normal cameras for private users .
in JP@@ EG images , a camera has often been applied to an internal scale . images in the raw format , however , must always be de@@ ported during processing .
some scanner turn a focal filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable them , you get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the edge @-@ up technique . you can access it with the menu entry .
they should hereby deal with this , however , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also reinforced the noise . in general , the usable technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image is the tool re@@ focus . at re@@ focus , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to raise .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is to cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than it too shar@@ pen@@ ing . use the tool for soft sign with the menu item sof@@ tening and experiment some with settings . the pre @-@ open@@ er on the right side of dialogue will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter is blur@@ red - a very good tool to remove ve@@ ils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the pre @-@ cursor shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first try out . an increase in the radius or the amount enhance the effect . if you create the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask too strong , noise and impression of caves near sharp edges will produce .
the radius is how many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter are affected . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ os . you should therefore raise images of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original one . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness .
the swelling value is a break from the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . it is thus possible to define a minimum difference in order to be applied for a channel of filters . in this way areas with a soft change between the kill@@ ers are exemp@@ t from shar@@ pen@@ ed from shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauty @-@ surfaces avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a spon@@ ger = 0.@@ 0 .
this &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus on an image by improving the edge . it used the copyright @-@ protected filter algorithm used by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to re@@ vert a picture ; in which there is a better approach than just try to raise the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for raising images is the use of a shar@@ pen@@ ed mask . re@@ focus mostly reaches better results than un@@ sharp . you can start it out of the menu by calling colors Re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice the circular f@@ elling works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads far from the original qu@@ ell@@ pixels . the F@@ IR Vienna in@@ verse the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ schen F@@ altung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . it causes unwanted results .
circular edge : this is the radius of the circular line . it is the main parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should result in 1 good results . you can put a higher value , if your image is very blur@@ red but should be careful on hal@@ low .
cor@@ relation : an increase in cor@@ relation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the cor@@ relation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0,@@ 99 . a high value for cor@@ relation reduces the sharp@@ ly effect of the module .
smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 is rarely helpful . if the filter quality is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a high value will be further contaminated the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ge &apos;s ac@@ ut@@ eness . this is most often caused by a previously un@@ sharp@@ ness gau@@ ge . in most cases , you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid de@@ ton@@ ous arti@@ facts . if you have a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the cor@@ relation and / tubes .
Mat@@ ri@@ cher size : this value determines the size of transform@@ ational measurements . however , an increase in the size of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose great value for the circular ut@@ eness or the gau@@ ge &apos;s ac@@ ut@@ eness . please note , however , that the module will be very slow if you choose great value for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
saving as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter which you set is set is saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all grants , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible but left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read images and compressed , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally produced un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharp@@ ness .
theoretically , it needs to create blur@@ red mas@@ ons . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur@@ redness . for the Vien@@ nese filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Vienna fil@@ ters always at least as good as the har@@ dy mask . the F@@ IR Vienna Filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small un@@ focused image , see :
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made using an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information about the methods of raising the digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the regul@@ ator de@@ tte puts the dis@@ sharp@@ ness of the zone of the cool@@ ed out , in order to generate a natural wh@@ om@@ ile .
the color @-@ tin@@ te allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool in order to remove no desired ar@@ te@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the invention algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pre @-@ settings are listed below :
if you want to use the filter preferences , you can use the rider smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to a moderate pol@@ l over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no edge is necessary to be in@@ toler@@ able . please note that the details of the details are always sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
judge dependency Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes even@@ ly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ining or C@@ CD Rau@@ e will produce a high value wav@@ eable pattern . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best placed in a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum glasses factor above al@@ es. then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . put this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves greater structures . the higher the value is set , the more becomes smoo@@ thes , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effects , he must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually , there is 1 or 2 .
angle @-@ reaching as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha was chosen small , it should also be chosen small . pay attention to that small angle to produce a long run . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral loop &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step in pixel . you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel dra@@ in and never exceed 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low . but it doubles its duration . we therefore recommend it to leave it .
the buttons Save as well as charging can make exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and will be loaded later .
picture errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load to move in . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break .
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected using a little arti@@ facts . the module is made in a photo that caused in Guatemala city with an analog camera . as you see there is a peculiar dun while the journey was created under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to l@@ apping sc@@ ru@@ ffles . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides selected image filters available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts that are used by dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor plu@@ gs from the camera or mo@@ des ; -@@ effects of ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot shows a typical scene which has been made using a digital camera and a high standard of ISO sensi@@ tivities . it shows a gra@@ ded noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain in default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for filters . large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can blur@@ ring the image . the space specified by the radius is moved by the image and the color in it becomes smoo@@ thes and thus minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . this value determines the pixel . this value continues to change the filter changes . if it is increased , smokers should change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer get and smoke or decor@@ ating it again .
edges : control the edge @-@ precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the fil@@ ters . if he is too strong can not remove the entire noise or smoke @-@ tips can occur . put it on a value close to maxim@@ izing if you want to remove a watch@@ ful noise or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the illumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which typically are ampli@@ fied , to increase . it also poll@@ uted the shadow areas .
shock absorption : controls the alignment of the adap@@ tive fil@@ tering radius . this value is defined as fast the adap@@ tive filter radius to occur when he is too high can occur , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter can occur at the edges . he can remove spac@@ ing tips and is the recommended method for it .
storing and store : these buttons are used exactly for it . all parameters for smoking reduction you have set , can be stored into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the smoke @-@ reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is fortunately much easier than a picture to raise . use this tool for soft sign with the menu item sof@@ tening and experiment with the smoo@@ ther side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; photo Restau@@ ration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photo@@ ar@@ te@@ amm@@ te .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted ar@@ te@@ facts of your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s movies , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sible , and local errors that arise in digital , original or later digi@@ tised images . the smoo@@ thing takes place along the con@@ tours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and text composition . the text condition is performed with another tool , the image error , conducted . the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ appe and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from being removed . as a loss of discomfort &amp; quot ; ar@@ te@@ facts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as well as loading exactly this . every adjustment of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and will be loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load to move in . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce how a photo with equ@@ idal noise will be restored .. The module is applied to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film gra@@ ins on the faces . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example for the photo restoration . this time , textures was reduced to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner device . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts created by the scanner lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows you to remove pictures from a C@@ CD camera , eight were to remove . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixel are especially high @-@ quality raw , photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression over a built @-@ in oppression for hot pixel .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ view method to remove . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button dar@@ ing . the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important to record the dark picture directly in connection with new hot or bright pixels with C@@ CD defect .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the correc@@ tive image . an automatic processing of the dark image becomes the bad pixel . note that the wiz@@ ard feels the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next session .
the picture area and the thumb@@ nail will help you correct the outcome . the pre @-@ showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are taken out in all of the most varied areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing this pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ating : it becomes an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting color is assigned to all def@@ ective pixels on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block , are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels in block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance from 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels in block .
Kub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixel in block .
below you can view the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ tization ; vig@@ net@@ ting correctly is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. sub@@ ordinate corners , an image to correct .
fores@@ ees objective , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that means the sensor there . tele@@ lenses show under circumstances also of this behavior .
however , it also has cons . many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the bl@@ ending filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . ven@@ erable objective should , even with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise loss @-@ effects arise by movement .
with the big expos@@ ures of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ and and grey scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equi@@ val@@ ente transformation to a raw material that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correctly turns the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is copy@@ righ@@ ted by John Walker .
with three re@@ gl@@ ers you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correctly and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light soli@@ dity absorption at the point of the largest density the fil@@ ters . the standard density is 2.@@ 0 , what a optical filter with a bl@@ ending setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 , dischar@@ ging . enhance the density to compens@@ ate a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ing correc@@ tive reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you must re@@ vert the exposure of the target image with these options . the controller provide you with only positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a subtle re@@ forming the exposure of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ came ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of vig@@ net@@ ing correction to one image applied . the original image ( 1 ) indicates the corrected picture . a lumin@@ aire and contrac@@ tu@@ tion was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etrical distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ des treats the general geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ exe form of the picture .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fl@@ acht but at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool .
the co@@ efficient Gra@@ des corrected the remote corners opposite the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , any geom@@ etrical distor@@ tion is almost eliminated .
generally , this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values ver@@ rot@@ or distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the Gra@@ des . this value works more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses the &apos; corners parameters has the reverse pre@@ mark of the parameter .
z@@ oom : this value scal@@ ates the size of the image and thus leads to a correction first Gra@@ des through . negative values increases while positive the image is reduced .
bright : this value j@@ us@@ hed the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correct . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the ton@@ s@@ - or ho@@ ver@@ ical correction should be carried out before all grants or size changes . best to cut this correction as all of the first . if you make a picture anew , and then perform a ton@@ ical correction would be the effect apparent .
to help you find the best correction is available to you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the edge of the side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ing / ho@@ ver@@ ical distor@@ tion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ ical distor@@ tion , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove this with the allowance tool in transform@@ ers from the image processing or over the z@@ oom regul@@ ator of this dialogue .
for most images the ton@@ ical correction is made . the next logical step for some motives like e.g. shots from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for sim@@ ulating inf@@ rar@@ ed film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ o.@@ c website which is accessible via this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ movie , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangular with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
beneath the preview , you can adjust two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensi@@ tivities ( ISO ) . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter slot channels to reproduce by inf@@ rar@@ ed film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color formations are missing .
this is an example of inf@@ rar@@ ed fil@@ thy effect applied to a landscap@@ ing of New Zealand . the original image is placed under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
the &amp; D came ; filter screens is a simple to use tool to reproduce movies on your pictures . this is from classic high @-@ speed films like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of movies the manufacturer great silver gra@@ ins of the photo@@ em@@ ul@@ sion .
the film@@ maker &apos;s effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere solved by daily life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ zing sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ b photos , so you must use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to the control of intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the bodies . the default value is , although frequently higher values need to be needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you still need more Kör@@ ner , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film body &apos;s effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ tised ; filter oil painting is created the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pie@@ ter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; quot ; filter oil painting , gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect .
there are two shelves to influence this effect . the top choose the brush size between one and five . thicker brus@@ hes are better for big images . glasses are controlled by the glasses or , from the other side , seen the uniqueness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and this is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size picture is 1 and Tro@@ sette 17 .
the &amp; D came ; filter coal lab@@ yrinth uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a stolen frame in the drawing . images of their gra@@ dient are slowly changing and therefore are not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sc@@ ure you . these would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper controller el@@ ects the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ( glasses ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ence filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adaptation of the Inten@@ sive value .
the &amp; quot ; filter engra@@ ving is shaped your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was temp@@ ting in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pie@@ ter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; quot ; filter engra@@ ving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in terms of content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity in order to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using a distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pie@@ ter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
Wellen@@ blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave blocks 1 will be distor@@ ted the image here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal picture in a work of artwork using in@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pie@@ ter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
z@@ oom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image along the star @-@ shaped lines that go out of a centre . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al nonsense : wi@@ red the picture by turning the pixels to a center . this sim@@ ulates the har@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal : blur@@ ring the image around the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
movement sharp@@ ness : caught the picture by horizontal movements of pixels . this sim@@ ulates the blur@@ redness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph , camera .
soften@@ ers : blur@@ ring the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle light .
bulk soli@@ ds : caught the picture by random shift of pixel and sim@@ ulates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary mo@@ ve@@ able camera .
intelligent in@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the colour@@ ing in the picture and blur@@ ring it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice little tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . thereby it gives natural your images a n@@ igh@@ ting appearance . it uses one of Pie@@ ter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright @-@ protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the trop@@ es . as the dro@@ plet size does not automatically increase with the size of the image . number changes the number and the density of drops . fishing changes the optical effect of drops in the image .
you can keep an area free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a vision , which should remain free . if you start the filter shelf , the area will remain free of reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the shelf filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
when the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or turning into the right orientation . the tools for this can be found in the transform@@ ers of turning or trans@@ its mir@@ rors .
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture to shr@@ ern is simple . the big question is , how can you re@@ ap an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good work . try him and you will see it yourself .
when a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below to see .
the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try to infl@@ ate the tool .
many imaging programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , i.e. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ tised ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable has been developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
aspect rati@@ os : when this setting is activated , the input of the new size is maintained with the original image of the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter involves greater structures . the higher the value is set , the more becomes smoo@@ thes , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effects , he must be set higher than 3 .
the buttons Save as well as charging will be used exactly for this . every entry for photo can enlarge as text file and will be loaded later .
photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load for yourself . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ atable by using a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of linear default aug@@ mentation .
the loss of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a often underestimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rec@@ tan@@ gle , then you will see this rec@@ tan@@ gle then while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photographs will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo is to cut down . you can change the size of the calcul@@ ator . you can create a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by clicking it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button Rec@@ order button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or storing in the menu file to save the newly created photo .
in the thumb@@ area you can change the size of the rectangular by post@@ p@@ one the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue will remain intact .
depending on page rati@@ os , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross format is assigned to width .
the tool After side rati@@ os uses a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always the same , regardless of whether you can use cen@@ tim@@ etres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons exist for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
down in dialogue , you can sit with the Max . ratio of the area to grant to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation , set .
the tool After aspect ratio , saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ontal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the write @-@ up tool the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the configuration settings allow to help you to put your pictures better , so that you can get your pictures better . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particle are based on the principle of similarity . as the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility of sharing a rec@@ tan@@ gle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles at the di@@ agon@@ als .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that appears on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sea or the sp@@ üt@@ lets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the ir@@ rational figure 1,@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks who thus used your temples and pyram@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number runs from Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where every figure is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is followed by this rule is regarded as visually harmonious .
the golden middle represents liquid relief lines if you put an image below . these help will be considered below :
the Golden spiral , you will bring your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ re@@ gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etrical visual flow .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ ces of the golden spiral , also called golden rectangular . it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition . that can be a line or different objects . this may simply be there without the eye to guide it becomes its task .
the Golden triangles also lead from the above discussed golden spiral . its ver@@ tices are the middle points of the sides of the golden triangles . please note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not syn@@ onymous triangles . Di@@ agon@@ ale to put on these lines can be a static object of dynam@@ ical .
if you are using golden triangles to break up your frame generate an effect of professional photo@@ grap@@ her dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise .
the options horizontal and flip @-@ flip can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic sub@@ missions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture of any angle .
if you make a photo then it doesn &apos;t happen that you &apos;re watching the camera just ver@@ tically or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things came around a corner . you can repair this with the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing and tool @-@ free rotation . choose to comp@@ ose free rotation and j@@ us@@ ze the destination angle .
rot@@ ate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the default values are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the top right above .
for your help , the module is free Rot@@ ation a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you set it on an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ze the angle as described in previous sections .
once you turned into an image you will find unwanted holes in the corners . an opportunity to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is automatic subsidies . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the rotation . but take note of the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transformations are carried out by a fix@@ ion of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red quad@@ ran@@ ces to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of dialogue , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixels .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the trans@@ acted area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the trans@@ acted area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ acted area .
angle right bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ acted area .
according to the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes somewhat poll@@ uted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ pleasantly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . an opportunity to see this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
the loop is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal resolution , i.e. the image becomes distor@@ ted . with other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle becomes transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via transformation .
move your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can switch horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press on pres@@ ets , the angle will appear on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail .
to your help will be a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to a crucial point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the she@@ aring , the image becomes a bit ti@@ pped . for a single she@@ aring this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two flo@@ cks generated twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after she@@ aring the image has a beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries comp@@ ili@@ zed . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tised .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all files available on your system . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and T@@ IF@@ F among them .
&amp; digi@@ tised ; displays only files in formats that knows . this happens with the extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list . you can change this list of file exten@@ ders that &amp; digi@@ tization . in the section configuration you will find further information about this .
virtually all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to select the format used . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . however , redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data on a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general , there is better , smooth results as JP@@ EG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save losses if this is stated in the settings .
if you want to know more about the shell format , you can read raw materials in English , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw materials images in JP@@ EG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ on@@ verter of &amp; digi@@ tised ; convert . in the section configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tised .
&amp; digi@@ came ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which came into &amp; digi@@ tised . all supported cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats that come from &amp; digi@@ tised :
many digital cameras support the recording of short movies . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG @-@ format . however , this formats will be able to show or edit images for the movies . however , if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ tised ; the &amp; che@@ de ; settings to play movies to start playing the program for play@@ back .

many tools that you need the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ tised ; your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as raising , sof@@ tening , smoke @-@ suppres@@ sing , re@@ focus , blur@@ red , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialogue type before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture ordinary quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current image . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison of the fores@@ ight . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected range .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower indicates the filter applied to the range below the selected range .
ver@@ tically share . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper range shows the original and lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : displays the thumb@@ nail if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ area and otherwise the original .

( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse within the picture and take on the part of the picture you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the left @-@ hand corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ tions from the last use of the module are marked .
the side bar features indicates the essential information on the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed into the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photo . these data come from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive dealer @-@ looking tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature order . you can press the mouse button or move it out and move it while you are fil@@ tered out and displayed in this coordinates . all images within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course this requires your images of ge@@ o data contained .
&amp; col@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ alle@@ ts files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and naming colors .
the p@@ alle@@ ts files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be used either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ alle@@ ts , or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is shown in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to there . afterwards , move the mouse with pressing left mouse button .
if the An@@ cruci@@ fied Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or under the button color is enabled , the color will either be inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode will be re@@ writing . this mode you can set by using the an@@ cruci@@ fix@@ ion re@@ writing under Bei@@ m C@@ urs@@ or .
a selection that has been created as in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; col@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each colour three values for the share of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a row of color , if a further color can be found in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ string .
the colours in the palette and the output of color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then you find it in the color selection on the left side .
&amp; Graph@@ ics ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , particularly in the inform@@ atics , so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are ob@@ sole@@ te according to the program author posted &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; Graph@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; Graph@@ ics ; is a KDE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; Graph@@ ics ; graphics are free layout programs . &amp; Graph@@ ics ; displays graphics with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; an example has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; graph@@ ene newly saved and in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or the graphs in &amp; graphic viewer ; in a &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
loading of large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to present more than this no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; graphic viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required .
the main window displays the open@@ ers graphics , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; graph@@ ically ; without a argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file open and the ( empty ) list contains missing files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot ; files are selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview of the corner will be displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without any special , left and right at impressive &amp; old ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; graphic viewer was modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is supposed to be loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; graphical viewer will also remember that later as well . should you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings ; set up ... use , see also .
when you open a graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer , &amp; eg ; in the file &apos;s browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; graphical inter@@ viewer , or want to present the lo@@ oming graphs in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at the start start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later change .
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graphs that are to be attached to one page , this page will be ignored . if you retain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the parts of graphs .
page preview with one on several pages shared graphs without head@@ line and with another font
the page again gives the ability to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the page opening is the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer ; you can specify a standard behavior for this case ( graphs in a new window , or set in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the site administration gives the possibility to set the start @-@ behavior of &amp; graphic viewers . you can specify a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if required for each start .
the context menu , usually at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up other options :
here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ ou@@ tal@@ g@@ ills . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for framed graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or curved designs of ger@@ min@@ tive graphs . the algorithm puts edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few can@@ o@@ vers@@ ations .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ ed graphs . it produces depic@@ tions according to the spring@@ board model . thereby the Cam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistics @-@ dimension@@ ally sc@@ aling sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm is created for ung@@ o@@ ded graphs a jumping stage model -@@ layout . it uses the Fru@@ it @-@ Rein@@ gold sl@@ ur@@ ism , and includes a multi @-@ iron sa@@ vi@@ on for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm uses the node circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cy@@ c@@ lical structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should include graph@@ end@@ ate@@ i as parameters , and the calculated layout of the graph@@ ene after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a lay@@ out@@ command you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms special options may change , or also change the graphs with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graphs ( directed or invali@@ d ) and uses the default algorithms for each type of ( dot ; for ger@@ ent , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ coated graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed , unless it is necessary . otherwise it will not display and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
showing the What is the mouse @-@ mouse button . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further help on this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the source folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it requires the following package :
a special setting is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphical viewers . in the menu settings you can find more options .
the main window of the icon Edi@@ tors is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ colour palette and the grid @-@ net in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog , in which you can choose whether the symbol should be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew .
makes the last revers@@ ed step again . if you don &apos;t have a step back@@ hand , this function is disabled .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can produce colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the icon palette of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
changed not the symbol , but sets the current string color on the color of the point , click on which you click .
the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current sign , the magnific@@ ation factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; establish a dialog with the three sides templates for symbols , background and tool@@ ra@@ ils .
with the buttons , add ... , Edit ... and Dele@@ te you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel insert or lin@@ e@@ ale display and arrange a chess@@ board as Transpar@@ ency display . you can also select for the chess@@ board the size : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Groß , as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read tools to read new images and to save them .
this module can be used to read and save new pictures of external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures of a scanner that supports the SA@@ NE Project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
when you open the menu item images you will open a dialog , which you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will replace your own image to select your image accordingly . check the preview and adjust the range your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
be sure that the window is displayed completely , as some settings may not be shown otherwise .
once you have pushed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan completed and the window to the fixing the options of the target image appears . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image stored by the image .
screen photos can be created after you have selected in the menu of Im@@ por@@ tier@@ - &gt; scre@@ enshot . a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
when all own program windows are selected , the retri@@ ev@@ ing program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read .
the delay determines how long the scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you have to switch to other working surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot was created , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .

the K@@ IP@@ I module doubles images are currently not looking for documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. for : the participants in this list speak English .
Flickr is an online photo line in the Internet . with Flickr , it is possible to show his photos to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , show the photos of your c@@ ah@@ and@@ y and show your photos safe and private your friends and family around the world .
the export @-@ animals module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be using the process of generating a line . this is thus easy to use your authentic@@ ation . it is therefore virtually your identification to Flickr . a browser is started so that you can register with Flickr .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . you will be presenting the following page after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . once you have pressed on Yes you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module can start ex@@ porting to Flickr for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which provides the current access to the module , welcomes you . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be pressed once again after you have set all other options . with this button you can choose the photos you want to upload . if you press on the O@@ k button , the up@@ loading of the photos to Flickr server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with one by comm@@ a separated list of words . these will be added to the image as tags during the wedding .
with the options Public , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can adjust the access to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as Private .
if you choose the option of changing the size of the photos before the up@@ loading , the photos are changed in front of the up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from that at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed as the aspect ratio is constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de Imaging Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. for : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ adata of an image and edit the geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ Stich@@ ting of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a card in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation puts tools available for images geograph@@ ically in sp@@ her@@ ical coordination system , used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itude and latitude are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alisation Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can create a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . to load up a possible cor@@ relation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera .
if the file loaded a automatic cor@@ relation , the coordinates are recorded in red @-@ times . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the c@@ ac@@ eit must be re@@ counted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone .
the adjustment for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and c@@ ac@@ eit . lies the devi@@ ation below are the data assembled . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential can be used when you don &apos;t have appropriate data . if you know that in reality , a loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relation to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing press .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog re@@ marked the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo .
location can also be found with the attached map and enlarge . select this time and enlarge . get this again and again through until you have reached a considerable accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the map can be switched between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is co@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alisation .
the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . you need to select all albums that will be exported to HTML . the albums are not displayed in a hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the field below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appear in the head of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s image defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will open in the image . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default imaging , &amp; eg ; f@@ ateful , displayed
the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ OS Export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information will also be stored in the new pictures .
with other color deep , you can change the standard colored deep . the size of course also affects the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider thumb@@ nails allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album riders for the thumb@@ nails , these are small images to be displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module created the pages , the window will not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program@@ ing reports to determine if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start in order to preview the preview of the gallery . press shots around the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging rate is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging rate allows Ih@@ n@@ ene to look at a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as screen@@ ings , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be using short @-@ missing and quick access to its functions .
after the start , an image is displayed by default in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss is a tool to change images without compromising quality without any quality .
this module allows you to store images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is it increases the file size , since no compression of the colour information is taking place . this can be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ Kli@@ ent is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. for : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module met@@ adata @-@ Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list of e @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the met@@ adata module you can copy data from one image to another . then select the import function in the main program and then call on the import function , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied afterwards to the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a di@@ asch@@ au .
the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ zer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick . between the individual images you can add a base frame . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV .
all images are automatically scal@@ able to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally you can select a background color for the Di@@ asch@@ au . with this module , it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start using the ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also modify sorting the images or the content of the list .
once you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . video format can be chosen from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan the file on a TV , you have to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that will indicate the image below . a low value creates very sudden , high on the opposite picture change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave it black . the name and the path of the generated file you can specify under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep it as possible as the extension mp@@ g .
if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file , then you will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your preferences . depending on the speed of your machine you can now get a cup of coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au when you are back again .
if an indication appears that co@@ den@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the button settings right down .
the printer assistant allows multiple images to be printed on a piece of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance you or to print with the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your images into one of three formats JP@@ EG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command lines d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original version of Him is : do you expect the same results as the software from your comrades . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears in mode for a single image . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings in the picture .
you can now re@@ use the values new to optimize the converting process . the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white . the essential parameters such as Gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be used . if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colors R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected for you to use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a loss @-@ hairy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , retains all the information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free LZ@@ W compres@@ sing .
in case you plan to edit your pictures frequently or to use later otherwise , you should not choose the JP@@ EG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you select JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ adata are stored in the RA@@ W file in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break the process again , you can use it off .
the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing at a single picture , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility of downloading the file automatically . this is helpful if you have been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available . a preview is not available . however , the progress has progres@@ sed as far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ score and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can change the image smaller or enlarge . these include four types of images available :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : scale change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed during this option .
print preparation : preparing the picture for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the phot@@ op@@ iers . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the coming pictures before . additional pictures can be drawn to the list of images to be downloaded and disc@@ ard it there .
after you started the module you will see the pictures window with the images selected by you . you can add additional pictures with a file op@@ tionally dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right side .
you can also drag images to the picture list and take a look at the list of images to be downloaded .
with the button pictures , the selected images are removed from the list of recent images .
once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . you have already attached the addresses below .
do not pay attention to many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the emails . it may possibly be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every@@ time used until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must install the GM@@ ail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the posting of comments in a fixed file , the comments on the images are put together into a text file and address the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality cannot be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format .
if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original extru@@ sion data are added to the larger images .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages , in search of errors , can be viewed . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button shot you can loop this window ? en .
after starting the module &apos;s Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you would like to show your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions displayed in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant cap@@ tions via OpenGL . however , you need to possess a corresponding graph card , since otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
this option will display fil@@ en@@ ame that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images can be displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are shown in a random order . so it will not be the order of the images used in the album .
taking delay between the pictures can be set the time gap between individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds comply with 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen effect . so you should au@@ st@@ est before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . by chance , at any transition between the images you choose another effect .
during Di@@ asch@@ au you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on .
with this tool@@ bar you can keep the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Sli@@ deshow .
on the left side of the screen you can see the current date , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ tate currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. for : the participants in this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the surface .
this module currently uses selected images , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your KDE work@@ space .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments , you can watch with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . by this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , therefore in person , places and in group keywords are available .
in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have typ@@ ed information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to view to EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described above .
if you press with the mouse to the entry persons , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible . by this selection , you can restrict the number of images from a few thousand pictures to a few single images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name . you can save with &amp; photo@@ album . however , for each person you can save its own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords , and other categories that you have defined themselves . see the picture .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button which is located right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate images ) .
you must also specify which image for each individual person is to display . to display this , you need to display the image asset window ( in detail ) , and in the context menu you will see the image for the appropriate person . in the select window you can adjust the magn@@ i@@ fying factor according to your requirements and thereby selecting which part of the image is to be displayed and cut down .
when you call in the main window , you will see a dialog , which is very similar to the dialogue for fixing the picture properties very similar . this dialog can be seen at the picture once again .
if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description , the sign@@ ments or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want you can also be a date of the total dat@@ ums , i.e. for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are pic@@ tured .
this is the manual for &amp; k@@ ft@@ album . . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather would like to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the quick entry , the screen photos and the TV videos .
start &amp; dress album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ ash album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry box . you will be loaded some sample pictures and you can test the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ olo@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you see the tim@@ eline . an image of this bar is shown here : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the name suggests , this bar shows you fil@@ um statistics about the images in your database . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tim@@ eline can display you several different time units . each Le@@ iste then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline allows you to interact in the following ways : you can change the displayed comments preview of the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date in the preview appears ) and besides , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the currently shown images when you look in the preview view .
you can also select an area of tim@@ eline by keeping the mouse button depres@@ sed and use the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ est@@ amps are drawn . if you select an area , you will only click pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; D@@ ress album ; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images . one is included in &amp; col@@ der album . the following part of the user guide will be described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . integrated version , which you can create via the File menu .
before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and target . in the following , every area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the moment and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . click the photo@@ album , HTML @-@ sample pages you see an example of these settings .
next , you choose whether a &amp; photo album ; export file will be created to see the page page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed in the viewer . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide certain images from specific considerations .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are obvious why not specifically received this .
down on the page you can set different resolutions for the images . thereby , those who have a look at your website and have a monitor that includes the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images downloaded , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission period . if he wants to display an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you create the different folder and the URL where your site is stored .
the best select for all your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder .
first , you will need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder is stored and automatically set up for all future images . here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is all done for viewers . if you choose the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , the URL you specify here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files do not exist in the final target folder you have to manually copy it manually . hence the import function , see , properly functions , you must specify the final target of the files , but the base sub@@ folder in which all sub@@ folders are .
the settings described above have changed all three to base sub@@ folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is laid down , whose name suggests you in the output folder .
if you are sitting on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ icking album . however , if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images , to write pictures , etc . , then you have to write with &amp; k@@ ft@@ album . this work will not even make this work again .
with &amp; Ad@@ dress album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they distinguish yourself if the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of all images to save in the file is that you may have all the images and that file can be transmitted as independently . however , the obvious downside is the file size .
you can select a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ex@@ porting ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in a double way . first , the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . the appropriate pictures are not found , so the images of the URL you have specified when you create the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , the dialog for the extru@@ sion of images described , which you can call via the menu file ex@@ porting ...
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
when you install manu@@ ell near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Autom@@ atically to copy the Autom@@ atically in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images are already compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth the files to compressed . if you want this anyway , just select the option export file comp@@ ress .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size . if you want to send your friends pictures , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by example , for example , that every image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ters ... select the exported database as described in .
the assistant to impor@@ ters consists of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it can be that you person@@ alise the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a d@@ ined ) , while this category is asked for your database persons . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which categories that are imported to imported file and which categories they comply with in your database .
the fourth step allows you to include the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database . one example is shown on the picture .
it needs to be simple to browse images and view : if you see images you often want to watch within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash . if you are looking for example images of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is pic@@ tured .
in this hand@@ book you will pass the different steps from ( 1 ) fixing the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) to look through and look up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and adap@@ tability .
the Photo@@ album was started as a program to ste@@ ward your pictures . but it has been extended and today your videos . at many places in this hand@@ book will be talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; C@@ lock album , saves all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml at the top folder of their images . these are a simple XML file that you can provide with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a disk or revisions on the CV@@ S where they like .
&amp; A photo album ; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically . if you want to check out another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in case you have a different folder with images , you can run &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ ak@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
through the menu entry settings dress album ; set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user guide , you will explain the different settings options .
on the left you can view six different symbols , with which you can view the preview of the preview and options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call through a key@@ press on the F1 button and one click on the desired option .
in case you have described how you can define different properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums .
see the dialog , which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a sign@@ ment and select a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in dialogue options you can set up complete members groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group , rather than in a group , rather than explained in a group as in one group .
in view the settings for setting up the members are available . with the above selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window , there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of the categories .
&amp; k@@ ft@@ album : shares his modular system with other graphics applications , such as digi@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of K@@ ip@@ i .
the modules can be called through the menu modules . they can not be described in this hand@@ book because they are not part of &amp; col@@ der album . however , most modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications to each other together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo @-@ database can always be tested first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures application . you can either call them on the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album - demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules on K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; col@@ der album . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; cold album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; photo@@ album , this kind of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates it for some modules that order for albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
the current album is sim@@ ulated , the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment .
next to the current album must &amp; k@@ olo@@ album , the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ ft@@ album : as follows :
if we show the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the setting dialog as category for virtual albums . so , if you want to use the category persons , your photo will have chosen for example ; so if you have chosen individuals to view the module and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the context modules which modules are to be loaded .
in the picture you can see an example of a starter screen , once you start &amp; a photo album , starting with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment we don &apos;t see a lot of information on your pictures . in the section we will come back to this window , but then click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview with all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with notes . this includes information on the persons appearing on the picture etc . you can put on any picture separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time . if for example , pic@@ tured on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures in Copenhagen have been included .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
in view three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ genic album ; as you will always use it when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is the shifting of images in the list : if you are pic@@ tured for example a family party and in all 50 images are shown the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can therefore have the used names shifted upwards to find people faster and assign .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tical list below , click on the icon for sorting out date under the list .
if you have selected any comments on each picture individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provide those pictures with any comments . just click on the back and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to view you that this is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the step @-@ catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally you can also put an entry into a category of this item . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . see this .
you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the post @-@ catalogue by clicking the Le@@ iste , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by setting it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button Options ... , which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can have a frame also complete . if you want to see this window later on , use the button Options ... and then you can see a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will receive an overview with thumb@@ nails of currently selected images , or of all images in case you don &apos;t have a filter . an example will be shown here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simple .
if you leave an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window opened with an image viewer , a new display will be created .
you can also delete images in the picture show . just select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and select either the Dele@@ te button or select in the menu Edit menu . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; C@@ lock album ; for this problem you can use a solution . you can also use the images saved on your hard drive . of course , you need to keep images stored on your hard disk . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
pictures , in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard drive . however , this is available for example with the pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can also view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you see , this function requires that you want to copy files out of the folders and copy again . if so , you don &apos;t want to worry about how the mess brac@@ ing of your pictures would like to avoid , please buy a larger drive to save all images to it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to block a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end you want to block any other in@@ accessible and click Cur@@ rent View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also view all images that can see your little sister , cont@@ eu@@ der and the menu item All besides current views .
in order for you to specify which pictures in the case of the case are to be hidden . if you lock the laptop now your little sister , so select all the images you &apos;ve blocked , hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re .
it is also possible to specify a password that must be typ@@ ed to block the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . for one are all images on the hard disk and the others can access the password as un@@ encrypted text or delete . this type of password protection serves only to those who work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures .
the reason you can describe all of your pictures with &amp; k@@ ft@@ album ; manage and spend hours more than hours so you want to see them sometime . for this reason , you can look at them sometime . for this reason , you can look at a picture _ and video clip . this is what you can preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it naturally shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter about the image , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can simply drag this with the mouse and put elsewhere . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see the right @-@ click menu below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser , see suitable entries for this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back to the picture below . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also accessible from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ v@@ asch@@ au . how often it invites you to press a new image by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and plus and minus . start and stopped the di@@ asch@@ au by the buttons C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ ft@@ album ; it is available in full @-@ screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the entry button to switch to full @-@ screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can move into the image and pull out zo@@ oming . with the Min@@ us button you can easily drag a rectangular button . with the Min@@ us button you can get back r@@ aus@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the image does not be zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ itable version sets the Zo@@ oms , so that each pixel equivalent to the screen of a pixel image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work on videos that are in and out of zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Minu@@ keys .
with the turn@@ functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image with the menu item from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen to put an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can preview the picture and Con@@ figuration dialog of the picture to insert this name . however , they will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and consider other photos .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with images and mark it as good or bad as you watch one by one .
for the two examples above gives you the viewer the possibility to watch pictures with characteristics while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter . in view one picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available to you in your browser . so , if you have all the images you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can easily use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you see categories in D@@ re preview , then you can add features to the images by pressing the letter for the characteristic after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow you to paint your photo album .
the mixture is not stored with the image , but in the database . in the way you can re@@ vert your own old one later .
in fact you can see an image on the painted one . to switch the painting mode from the context menu . to end the painting , simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all the sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to add a new object to the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following folding menu is finished , so that you can choose the right position :
with delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the right @-@ click menu of the right mouse button you can immediately remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have changed properties , click on applic@@ ators to take these changes . have you posted invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can click on the input errors or throw the changes with abor@@ ting .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation in the setting dialog box , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the selected object using the help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ al view .
press preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ ating view and a small example of the scene is displayed with the selected texture , even if you want to have selected a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally .
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button , and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points will disappear and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and spin and the position for reloc@@ ating . you can change the shift by drag@@ ging with the mouse within the whole window .
each object appears as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as an absolute value . objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visibility level of visibility in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need another order , you can adjust them as you can . you can also save several shut@@ ters and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or under an existing view , drag the starting point to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starting point to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height .
if you want to arrange a number of views over each other , drag the starting point to another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card &apos;s driver on top of the views .
the last possible window order is un@@ ra@@ ging views : views which are not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window . to resolve a view from the anchor , drag the starting point to the desktop , or click the small to the left top arrow in the grid .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the panel bar . to prevent the shot , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views . new views are sh@@ ame@@ ful , you can anchor them in any position .
the current window view will save you with view window order ... save it . there will be a dialog displayed in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
when you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual has been written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is currently supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ der The symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene ren@@ ders .
a Ren@@ der mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to add a scene in different sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many ren@@ aming modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the icon of The Ren@@ der settings in the tool@@ bar , or in the menu view Ren@@ der modes ... select the following dialog is opened :
each rendering mode has a name . you can input any name , but it is a name that lets the properties of the mode be recognized .
in the box size , you can list the width and height of the left image . if you want just to ren@@ ders a small area of the image , select the cross@@ box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that &apos;s used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the ren@@ ame features can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
if an image is rolled with only one ray from pixels , different bugs can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é @-@ pattern or stu@@ ary effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . in general see pictures with this property better .
when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a beam je pixels . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel is getting further distributed and adap@@ tive because the re@@ cur@@ sions depend on calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , trac@@ ts POV @-@ Ray a ray of pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the nearby pixels , then both pixels are calculated by pursuing a certain extra number of pixel with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value on 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ determined threshold , then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are being pursued individually and set to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the production of smokers for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn J@@ it@@ tering , modified &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of the Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this cardboard card you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixels is then transparent when the accompanying rays have not made an object .
opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly ends , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import the menu , select the menu entry file ... and select a file in dialogue window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete instruction l@@ sum@@ ing of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if at bee@@ keeping error messages or warnings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , just select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene ren@@ ditions . usually this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in Fe@@ atur@@ ating view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your documentation and the version a . supported the version 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. high altitude ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label .
you can set the item from the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model view . you can set here the grid separately for shifts , scal@@ ding and rotating .
larger values give a more precise wire model and therefore a better sewing for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detailed stage for two directions separately .
when you cross the High details fi@@ del@@ ity for extended proj@@ ections , all proj@@ ections are further divided into the proj@@ ections . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
when you see wall view , a wall behind the objects will be removed . the wall is displayed in a chess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you want to display soil , a floor is displayed below the objects . the floor is displayed in a chess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
when you activate edge @-@ glasses , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise information about the parameters can be found in the section Ren@@ der modes .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window systems . in the section window arrangement , you can create and store shut@@ ters .
the combination field standard window order : displays all existing window arrangement . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window app@@ ings displays all existing window arrangement . a new arrangement can create you with the button Add and delete an selected order with the button removal .
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can create and delete selected views with the button removal .
the position of the new window . with new column create a new column on the right hand side of the available window , with oun@@ cing the window below the existing window , using cart@@ on board you get a cardboard card along with the previous view and sh@@ ame@@ fully anchored the view not in the main window but also creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you want to follow without more exact knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but easy scene , under beginnings : a bul@@ let on a layer .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you will get as a result just a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should note these important rules :
if you cannot set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black image .
if you do not insert lighting sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following presented window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can get a proper idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starting with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all the objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item for editing . you now have a scene without objects .
the wire @-@ model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate . in particular , you notice this in the fourth wire model view ( right down ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you see the content of the view object attributes , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject later instructions , but note that the camera in the view points will change , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the button on the button or the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera .
there are lots of ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a non@@ represent@@ ational method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a easier way . you can use an infinite plane as the ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the button applic@@ ator or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be immediately displayed .
the wire @-@ model view now shows the level if also at the moment only as a limited end@@ ant level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level stretches up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree , you will notice that you can click on the item + before the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object : scale , spin and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows :
just choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog , where you can choose how the object is to be inserted . you can change the name in the object view . you can view the name in the original view ( name = bottom @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment will look now .
of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a mat@@ ured black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . give you now the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many options now , but take the simplest .
if you don &apos;t want to see any color in the qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now properly set . if your image is now with a click on the icon , you should get the following results :
of course , that is not the far@@ thing you expect . here are other settings necessary . in the color list , you need to enter two new attributes . then you can edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the object @-@ tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should just run this step as you should have understood the basic functionality of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the ground :
in the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button on the button ) , so that the ball rolling over the ground , since you have moved the floor around a unit down .
of course , the rendering results in a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ ured black material . put in the next step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can assign it to a material now . as already on the floor , type the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select First sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on the ball pig@@ ment , then select the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features :
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the button or press the input button .
the settings she@@ en effect and reflection has already yiel@@ ded some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you are &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a rendering method to generate a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
when you hit a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots of ren@@ derer &apos;s hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera , which reduces the scenes ) through the objects and how atmosphere effects , such as fog effects . thus , the scene pixels are processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you will also see nothing , the image is simple black . obviously , every scene that shall be lo@@ oted , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ;
always when you open a new model or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replace the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already stored the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space .
display the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be rejected .
this menu entry can only be selected if you don &apos;t have stored @-@ stored changes in the scene .
repeated the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used editing .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and standard behaviour .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can edit or add new commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove options with this option tool@@ ing for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove .
a b@@ ump @-@ map is a way to avoid consuming surface without any bo@@ il on the surface individually model and without changing the geom@@ etrical form of the object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a b@@ ump map as well as for texture map .
basic body are simple geom@@ etrical forms that you can use as components : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further edited to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base , using a picture file as a color card .
&amp; B @-@ f@@ ateful ; is a comfortable image asset and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; cu@@ f@@ ateful ; is very simple . the file &apos;s browser lists files you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
you can set whether any image should be displayed in your own window , or if all pictures should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first characters of the file in the browser window . then a small input field has been found in the right bottom corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; Es@@ c ;
in the dialog setting - &amp; cu@@ f@@ ateful ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; sp@@ ouses ; in the other two , short @-@ command for the display and short command for the browser , the keyboard short@@ cuts can be specified for each window .
if this is chosen , then the images are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad is filled with the background color that you can continue to set up . default is not full @-@ screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; f@@ ateful ; already the next picture in the folder while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option stores &amp; cu@@ f@@ ateful ; in passing the name of the last @-@ opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; f@@ ateful ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the coloured beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , even here the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; X@@ f@@ ateful ; so set up that only some of the file types are shown that the program can also be present .
with this option the display of the display will be expanded to the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ ders or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the show will be repeated until it is broken down by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of works of &amp; cu@@ f@@ ateful ; in the box maps short @-@ command for the scor@@ eboard and short command for the browser .
this option switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for files ) and the one @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in a window around .
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short application .
displays small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short delivery .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short application .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
enlarged the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the scor@@ eboard for the pictures . &amp; cu@@ f@@ ateful ; will also be closed if no browser window is open anymore .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found it is selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo processing based on the &amp; Image magazine ; Bild@@ editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; Design came ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo : is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; a show@@ room is an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo : it makes it possible to inform you as easy as possible errors or any possible improvements . this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all the required information is already filled and you can simply follow the instructions to submit your message .
&amp; show@@ photo : is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo . however , you can already ask questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo . however , in this mailing list , however , you should be English , you should be powerful this language therefore .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo : it is the developer mailing list to join . guidance to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo : .
&amp; show@@ photo : try to control so much control over its work@@ flows . there are many options to change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to set up these settings , you need to set up in the menu settings show@@ room . you can switch between them by pressing on the symbols of the left side .
in the field of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ load @-@ detec@@ tor is selected . skill@@ fully should the colors with what you should display , in contrast stand . under@@ exposure should display a bright colour and over@@ burden a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and promotions to the selected images . the same side bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five riders :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and storing .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and storing . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog to save and save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the file .
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE Project by checking the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command line l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no default scanner was specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to open scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop breaking &amp; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
in order to make an image , the user can start a pre @-@ flop and then scan Scan@@ o for the final scan . the Vor@@ os@@ copy is launched by the preview button .
to select the image can select the user into the image and out of the current selection out of zo@@ oming . it can also set the z@@ oom in such a way that the complete preview fits the window .
if the image was selected then the final picture can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a pre@@ disposition like below , then the image is saved , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ li@@ tion and you will get back into the main window .
through the button settings the equ@@ itable dialogue is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can look at the picture if desired , before saving a preview . in this case , the option before saving a preview is selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be chosen .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; images saves . dialog to save for each picture opens the dialog in front of any scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically will be saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must choose to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option of storing without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for dialogue on store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically re@@ mitt@@ ent images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in dialog to save . this automatically saved image gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix of the je@@ des@@ mal is numbered when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can custom@@ ize the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when choosing . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t .
the button help starts the KDE assistance with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button over will start the KDE About -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to stop &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used as all other programs short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Glob@@ ale short@@ cuts you can set up by clicking with the right button of the mouse button in the player window and select short instructions ... select .
you may set up available multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command function . this makes you feel your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control centre .
the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context browser , player , play@@ lists , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP function break could &amp; eg ; look like this :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the head@@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command lines .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and make use of dialog , so the user note why a script does not run .
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( KDE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is the use of the instruction d@@ co@@ p ; which should be included in each KDE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands . this will usually be called ex@@ ec ( ) function . in this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . to this reason , strings should constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure command is the script to view the setup dialog . to save the store and loading of the furnishings , each script must take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok uses the work@@ folders to the folder where all the data should be saved .
track@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for example ; with D@@ COP functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length ) .
vol@@ u@@ me@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu above contains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu clicked on . to add a listing to the menu , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ ve@@ Men@@ u@@ I@@ tem ( sub@@ menu Of Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; termin@@ ated , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so . for example , storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script can also install script packages that the user &amp; eg ; downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly detect the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extended amar@@ oc@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right correctly .
the main kri@@ pt must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining Ad@@ ditional modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to get the file right :
if your script is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link the link to the Wik@@ i script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attached . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ o@@ ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and still is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can easily drag music to the playlist instead of going through endless menus . perhaps you are looking for only one particular title of thousands of pieces in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collectors &apos; browser and the Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is exactly right for you . and if the decision is still hard to choose , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music based on certain criteria .

to see the actual piece in the piece change clearly , that the play@@ lists window stops , in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when moving to the context @-@ browser change the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance adapt . the section is divided into three parts .
in writing @-@ section you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the otherwise known section is enabled . you can select writings for the following sections : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press text ... , so you can select a type of text from the selection dialog .
with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set its own color scheme . use the included color selection for front and background color .
play at the start brings about that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start the play@@ back automatically continues with the piece in the place , with which it has been stopped by the last ending .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed , and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click out ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the bond of shadows causes the text in the OS@@ D sha@@ ded .

the screen screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen a multi @-@ monitor area will appear the OS@@ D .
the Kart@@ ei@@ card audio output makes you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate even further entries in this box .
the Kart@@ ei@@ card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; to browse according to music files . to browse a folder in the collection , select the bond field next to its name . this section also contains references to sub@@ fields such as with selected folders .
sub@@ folder recur@@ sively search : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music will be recognized .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok : is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of features and gallery of screens .
Amar@@ o@@ ok needs only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other KDE packages . you must have K@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including those contained in it , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them written to have e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the OS@@ D set out that your window manager will function the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example , but we try to support Amar@@ o@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they set up an excellent development environment .
most likely , one of your files will make a mistake in the day Li@@ b library . you can check the file at ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and hang on the cap@@ ut@@ te file that causes the crash . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of this is that Tag@@ lib when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this bug to the tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try again SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled . if B. &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to disman@@ tling the met@@ a information .
if you are using KDE using art@@ s@@ d , then disable machines . off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) . if it is a frequent turn @-@ down and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ info , but they do not mark as Unic@@ ode . the following Perl script raises the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; play _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script required the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) see in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you will find the status De@@ activated on grey and half @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol to three times until this setting shows up their effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : icon look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ r . please check if Amar@@ o@@ ok is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you possibly need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok is the correct version first .
there are several ways . most of the installation problems clarify the ligh@@ test by means of an expert for your Unix - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or with developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help to search for . please enter a mistake there if something is located at the up@@ lift of a bug in Amar@@ o@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in ?
that is easy . use the file &apos;s browser to the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to intu@@ i@@ tively keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window has been converted into the Statistik @-@ Window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating through the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , must be displayed in the playlist the playlist , and select column display . click anywhere in the new rating column , to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ ok in the background is .
select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from play@@ lists remove from the folding menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall , just like you would do it with other files , so easy is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably lacking the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look to li@@ b@@ ail@@ ment , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the Equ@@ alizer can be found in the context menu ( on the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! none ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; used one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question are the What media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will not be delivered in the default configuration ( for patented legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ ad driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously reach an audio module . this can be reached by a sound card with hardware mix@@ er ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa .
the output of this command should help you in search of the problem of mur@@ m@@ ness and a solution . for Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ als ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ stre@@ amer is the best choice if you are looking for a decade or with little overhead . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print right to Al@@ sa , as well as x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
with KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ F co@@ de@@ cs , the disturbed play@@ back can cause . read this error report . the magnific@@ ation of sound puzzle in your Al@@ sa @-@ setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ s.@@ so &amp; etc . ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less contracts react to visu@@ al@@ izations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ ho@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; off . why ?
after installing G@@ ho@@ amer , you need to register all components . run G@@ ST @-@ register to register all G@@ stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ o@@ K before ! ) : - Download your ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then remove the module @-@ folder of G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module @-@ Fol@@ der with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
please report on our mailing list . if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send them the best to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ de@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album by British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very well and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magic ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP is that already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let you run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; the play@@ back start . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken from the gentle killing of music that you have stopped before bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles can be found if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is available , you can proceed as follows . Th@@ en@@ command gives you interpre@@ t and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user &apos;s user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your user@@ name with your user@@ name . this suggests that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows be separated . press this on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size modi@@ fiable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button sets a piece in the chin @-@ down sequence into the queue in queue . by pressing the input button for a search in the playlist , the first search result is played and the search is reset .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of control bar ?
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser are to be displayed .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / Amar@@ ok on a local drive left , or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
place the CD , then click the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal reading , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic de@@ code instead , take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ C@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ string ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ ated@@ ate , the F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) ;
basically this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single evaluation on the overall result .
you can insert the review for a piece by yourself by clicking on a column trans@@ cript in the playlist window . here , you can change the evaluation of a piece button in the playlist , as all the other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit it . you can edit the review also in dialog met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to provide you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ K . this means : KDE packages have set a fixed release plan that does not share with the short @-@ run plan of Amar@@ o@@ K .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ o@@ ok , which some users can certainly also find annoying . disable the option icon at playing animated in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings work@@ flows ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click on new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graph@@ ics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too similar . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; while in the Con@@ quer@@ or brow@@ ses . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and select in the folding menu to add Amar@@ o@@ ok ;
audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free user@@ name and password . audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
if you would like to use Al@@ sa then the latest available version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ ey@@ s and thus also caused a lot of error reports .
probably got &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; compile before you have x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine has not compiled this output modules . you must configure &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still appear not . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files . you must now install the package g@@ stre@@ amer de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine de@@ vel . afterwards you will need to re@@ compile and install again .
I consider the error G@@ stre@@ amer cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos;@@ ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ und , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you will have to compile G@@ ho@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ e@@ pl@@ ers . a tip of Merlin @-@ TC : U@@ d@@ ne you don &apos;t compile L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ o@@ K .
I hold the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , even though the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ ho@@ amer , you have to be installed beside g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time .
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 @-@ stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as a system manager G@@ ST @-@ register . then you start Amar@@ o@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound card ?
under settings Amar@@ o@@ K set up ... audio output type you enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ i@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 } type plug plug d@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ plug h@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug cup@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the setup dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the ta@@ str@@ ates , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual mix @-@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio issue with Arts will not be taken care of . you may take this problem naturally even into your hand ! if you want you can be the new so much needed super@@ visor for Arts : )

the button Edit allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database is stored . this is not a run text script necessary .
the button Find opens a search for google.com of the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpreter - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are considered to be ignored .
group@@ ing / album - first the pieces are sorted by interpre@@ t and below , a further distribution will be made according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are shown at the start of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group interpreter / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the standard 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be shown first by genre and below performer .
group@@ ing genre / Interpre@@ t / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted according to the album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adapt the group@@ ing to your choice and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; your collection will automatically record automatically once you have something to change the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
right under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the building view . notes for the use of this filter you can find in the section for the playlist in this hand@@ book .
under the search filter is a selection field , with its help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can also select your total collection , thus making the filter convenient off .
by clicking with the right mouse button , click on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
load - This le@@ ert the current playlist , and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in reproduction .
attached to play@@ lists - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces into the queue . this function will be played next .
as a playlist , you save the selected pieces as a playlist . you are asked for a name on which the list is to be saved .
to transfer on media player - Add the pieces into the queue for the transfer to the Media Player . further details can be found in the section on the Media Player browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / On CD - others Due to the selected pieces sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as data - or as audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not display .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece @-@ information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) files in the du@@ st@@ bin ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears among different interpre@@ ters .
compilation of markings - changes a compilation marked album back into a normal album . the album is then no longer displayed among different interpre@@ ters but once again under the interpreter .
the playlist browser creates the handling of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains intelligence play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . this use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful play@@ lists for running time automatically . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the gaps in your collection that have never been played .
even self @-@ created play@@ lists are possible . click to create a playlist to open the dialog to create a new intelligence playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window Media Player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ys . for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start , you can find the pieces on your iPod to interpreter sorted in the upper list of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces on your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you are finished , click on over@@ wear . if the transfer is completed , stop &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and redeem the drive connection for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar is a search section where you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list , all files are hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is a address bar with which you can get music from a checked URL . if you are using tar / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and input boxes , you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window square , the hanging files can be helpful by simply str@@ ap@@ pers . in that case , the fet@@ ching of the Shift key can be helpful : thus , random files are automatically added at the end of the list , and not on the mas@@ on .
the playlist keeps all of you logged in . you can change the order by typ@@ ing the entries simply using the mouse to the desired point . once you enter the letters , only the pieces included . to reset the filter , push the reverse , until the text@@ box is again empty .
when you enter with spaces separate search terms , will contain &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; for entries those who include all search terms . if you enter as one of two , the search will find all entries , one , two and three .
if you input between the search terms , will be searched for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries the spaces are included , then include the search term with da@@ zz@@ ling : Mike Old@@ field . this will include entries that Mike Old@@ field is not included , but according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you provide a certain search option , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for mosquit@@ oes which have higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece which does not contain a specific search term , make a minus character before the search term : -@@ something looks for mosquit@@ oes which do not contain something .
you can combine this syn@@ tax@@ able variations on one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this is looking for all the mosquit@@ oes included either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can specify the play@@ back series of entries by clicking on the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries then get a marking with a number . the number matches the order in which the pieces will be reproduced .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . you will find buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you can add the button Add , with which you can add the playlist pieces . to the right of it you can save playlist , playlist , empty and random@@ ly mixing .
next , the buttons will follow re@@ use and re @-@ establish . you can re@@ vert or re@@ vert changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu like that which you get in the player window on the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration set up .
there are many other available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume , for example . you can set up the buttons , by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bar ... select .
the status bar provides you with a quick overview of the useful information for playlist , the number of pieces and total play@@ time of all pieces . in addition , the status for random mode will be displayed . the status of random mode will be displayed , and re @-@ pick up the status for random mode and recovery is easy to change by clicking with the mouse twice in the appropriate ad area .
you can also hide the status bar . this allows you to view the status bar display in the general settings .
you can reach the context menu through one click with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist menu . via this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok .
one click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alis@@ er plug@@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ izations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry , a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information on &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover pictures . you can launch them by choosing promotions in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by choosing the interpreter on the left side .
with the menu view you can choose what to display in the cover administration . choose from :
the queue administration received your big withdrawal in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist , appears in the playlist , a number next to the title . this number represents a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in der &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as a second , and so on .
the management of the queue you want to add to the queue administration . if you want to add a piece using the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces in the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then change in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists where two are already given ( the details to set up these follow later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds another random pieces while playing another random pieces .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that there are already some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need any last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile that works this dynamic playlist .
click on the playlist , drag them to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select shop . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist , so under circumstances !
the two pre @-@ drawn modes of random mix and play@@ lists are instantly re@@ boot your playlist , and you can add at least one piece even from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of items , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again .

with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
type here any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist is continuously growing , the setting for upcoming pieces will be over@@ passed and they will no longer hear a piece twice in this playlist , if the setting is active , the already played pieces are removed under consideration the setting score .
split pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which should be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each playing piece . if you set here more than 1 , the playlist is continuously growing , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialogue , you can already select existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you have multiple play@@ lists , you will add multiple play@@ lists from each of the attached play@@ lists .
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on setting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts install by clicking on the script . after you install the script , a new entry is displayed in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button Fur@@ ther to get more scripts .

normal ize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can be useful for example to create pur@@ pose@@ ful CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without normal ize , the different absorption of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect which will vary depending on the music pieces .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge projects recently . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
saves the current project . if the project has been saved once , the previous file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog will be displayed , with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all the opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you call for each individual project file saving .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and not yet saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose between saving and changes . besides , you can also drop the loop and keep the project open .
includes all open projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will be asked for any not stored project , which should be done to pass , just as if you were called for each project file .
closes all the opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . for each non @-@ saved project will be asked what to do with it , as if you called the file .
when you call this entry , you can select from the appearing dialog files to the project . that &apos;s the same effect as if you &apos;re using the files directly from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files that are added in the base folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the characteristics @-@ dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful when you &apos;re using files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi@@ disciplinary CD . it is useful for you to be used rather than help to see the files already available on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears in an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function led &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project . this feature removes no files from the medium , they bl@@ ends only the previously imported files .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this also allows the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also just want to burn a picture of a CD . additionally , there is also the possibility of K@@ lon@@ n instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should prefer frac@@ tures when you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this also allows without the project file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only get a picture of a DVD using the copying dialogue will not be supported , therefore the target medium must be big enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to the format@@ ting of a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the contents can be completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b gives you the choice between writing and incre@@ mental .
burns a previously er@@ ased CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously er@@ ased DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button .
a previously un@@ successful DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but it can also be used on @-@ standing video , coding and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the occasional medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
switches the folder view , or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the index view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info , lock and locking the drive or throw of the medium .
switches the table view one or off . the table view allows to choose and draw files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
when copying the cop@@ es in the project view is a narro@@ wer range , which is only visible when the project view open projects contains . the Cop@@ y list has no real function , it looks only pretty , and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this opens a dialogue window to change the keyboard arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . after one of the commands has chosen in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard rules below .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; setup assistant . you can set the proper per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system managers are required , therefore , you must enter the password for the system administration ( root ) when starting the wiz@@ ard .
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . here you can set the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; you should work on tap . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to the refinement of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface equipped . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more comfortable program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality , so it &apos;s more to be your taste and the type of your task setting , which the accompanying programs you give you .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP , you must make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . then enter something like the following at the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , all of the &amp; k@@ de ; have in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the Standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; features features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ format DVD and additional features for creating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Web@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Web@@ D@@ Project ( ) The COP@@ Ref Cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ e@@ X@@ D@@ Project ( ) void my D@@ v@@ d ( ) void Lo@@ v@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project will be obtained via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch using this reference , it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void vit@@ ve@@ I@@ tem ( Q@@ string path ) void renal Vol@@ u@@ me@@ ID ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string Name ) void set@@ Vol@@ u@@ me@@ ID ( Q@@ string name )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT Cre@@ ate@@ fol@@ dable / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reading for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it you can easily read audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading from &amp; CD ; data contained in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers that support these W@@ AV files ( los@@ som@@ er packages will still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional co@@ den@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as the loss of F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this must be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ ed ( for MP3 ) or other co @-@ codes are already available , it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something yourself . however , only the code modules are not used , the installation is also not required .
which code / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ zer gives a small introduction to cooking , audio quality and comp@@ elling factors .
a word on the copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ be@@ holder ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to avoid any copying audio CD ; even if not the firmware of copying , it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of cop@@ ious audio CD ; simply avoid the purchase of Cop@@ ier@@ ine Audio @-@ CD ; s !
while setting up only once must be made ( the setting dialog box may be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , returns the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard drive for the slim approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get out of the Internet or can fully work without network , whereby everything is manually recorded .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data accordingly to the installation of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online in the latter case must first be connected to the Internet . )
start reading and - if an Encoder has been configured in the default configuration settings in the box @-@ box - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default . it is to be noted that previously the Encoder has been configured in the default dialog box in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager , so that an already selected file will be chosen rather than full &amp; CD ; read and codi@@ fy .
opens the setup dialog around the type of aler@@ ts ( like protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main character dialog of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , cooking and compression rates and helps you choose the right code .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss of free audio format is required . besides F@@ LA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may possibly be available to this distribution . the down@@ sides are low compres@@ sing and barely available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data dres@@ sers depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but above this bit@@ rate the differences will produce very good audio quality since both Ko@@ di@@ ans produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rate ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deeper bitter@@ ness .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stere@@ os@@ ystems . today - initially , these devices are not only the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and car stere@@ os@@ ks . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo plants .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which are manually inserted manually or through the program automatically from the free@@ DB over the Internet are available as a list of parameters . you can be passed / used with &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ cal programs , there is often a combination of programming settings for the code of code and these parameters . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ern explain the switches to these programmes .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are co@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch set of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; added : the result is as follows : &apos; ... set { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = Kno@@ pf@@ be@@ g in assistant ) :
that &apos;s what the free@@ DB is : a free database to read / enter the audio CD , so that all other information can be downloaded instead of using yourself into the computer . it is to be noted that here only the text is spoken : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I do not mean it . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; so no one can prevent the information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , the information cannot be added to the artist or the CD ; all information can be obtained in case of a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; shop , physically or virtu@@ ell .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; active a cross @-@ box address ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the e @-@ mail address may not be used when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from the server ( This may only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for the use of free@@ DB , the geographical server will be used in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org returns a current list of mir@@ rors for online retri@@ eves of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that this c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed at first if this is not yet done .
to save the extrac@@ tive W@@ AV files the code can be chosen and thus the desired file format is selected . at first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compres@@ sing for audio data ) on the tab for setting the code . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the code package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined code . more information about co@@ di@@ ers can be found in the chapter of the code .
after installing a code , further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a sol@@ itary window ( eg . con@@ sole ) . this must be replaced by the name of the installed code .
this can have many causes . check the installation of device drawing of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reader power , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio @-@ code of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give a hint about what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this may give tips how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and to read our first &amp; CD ; we will l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found as it is not completely free software . at least , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is there and that you have writing them ( eg ; by trying to copy with the Con@@ quer@@ or into something ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which will probably be done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for any out &amp; CD .
here we determine the compression code for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and what structure is used to use . as we are lazy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet download .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to change a &amp; CD ; change once the matching settings are found .
the device @-@ drawing is given to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device @-@ drawing of your drive . if this does not work or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look inside the file / etc / f@@ bar and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the cart@@ on board General settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be shown / typ@@ ed as in the scre@@ enshot .
only for un@@ complete information can be asked , so that you will be informed when details are missing in sampling ( tags ) .
the cart@@ on CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet of a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD ; so that it can access to the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are dis@@ satisfied with the database entry / fil@@ en@@ ames or day entries , they can easily be changed . the directory or file name will be changed with Con@@ quer@@ or &gt; um@@ ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 @-@ tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example is further to consider : if you want to manually enter the selection fields and free@@ DB . however , these are not used with free@@ DB locally in offline mode . however , these can be selected by free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the next cardboard card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server through the Internet . how does the system know which data will get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . put everything as it is in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near the computers . however , this approach will function as a first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls are bo@@ iled the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to submit a &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server will transmit . the first an@@ alog@@ ous field should be suff@@ ice .
just take the settings of the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ de ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , please click this to look at the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want this cross , then the path / folder can be specified in which the W@@ AV files are stored . this can &apos;t be beneficial if only space on another drive is available . if the box is not attached , the files will not forget , if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
all as input as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is somewhat long , under certain circumstances , something must be fed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average approximately 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the reached compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. year . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneous W@@ AV files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to purchase more than a W@@ AV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; termin@@ ated . this configuration is used as standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section , described how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is set up on the hard drive , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described in this section , must be repeated for any out &amp; CD .
as we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in free@@ DB , see the screen photos somewhat different from the ones for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; they will learn to manually input the &amp; CD ; instead they will learn from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done so now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; you could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers according to the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successful from the free@@ DB has been picked up , all tracks of the pieces are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album are shown .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window will be built , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you do not have the cross field for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) have been selected , you can manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data out of the Internet , need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot one . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; latest title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be typ@@ ed in the input field , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment box can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ z@@ ell per piece , the comment @-@ box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB the CD @-@ editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Edi@@ tors , so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album names ( e.g. if all words with large letters begin or not ... ) but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters in the commentary area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited dirt length , at least to that which &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum permits . this option is set up at the default settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; .
you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ zer to find more information .
simply select an entry that is evident in the style of the out@@ fit CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not submit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD Edi@@ tors will appear again and you see that the fields are already filled with the data contained in the album we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and process you the same way until you have entered the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown beyond the list .
note that there is a check @-@ signs before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure all the pieces are selected , or pressing the button All pieces selected at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection out of the read process , so this window appears to confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the kno@@ bs of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window of controlling orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you &apos;re trying to work with a code that you have not installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp file and the target range are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have typ@@ ed on the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . therefore , read and code in parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it &apos;s now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in high @-@ performance machines the result is unclear . the used computer with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem in simultaneous reading and code ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the code . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will end with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; audio creator ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; will now chat within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S are now included with CV@@ S . however , most distri@@ butions contain already a pre @-@ compiled package , because &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . install the package k@@ dem@@ ult@@ media from your distribution . if you read this , you have probably already done it ...
this section is directed to individuals that compile files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted if it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different card cards of settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu is clicked on the first time starting point of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ?
what is this about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot be maintained this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual too &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . who also wants to add something useful or change it , may it do . at least after hearing with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agree with this proposal .
odd , if you have succeeded to fetch the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has not covered with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke @-@ real @-@ time drawing of texts also some features , the other &amp; UNIX ; MIDI player .
&amp; T@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; b ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project drivers , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ enz@@ er .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by using the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to KM@@ id can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ itals or text events ) . KM@@ id automatically determines the method used .
seat support . if you stop &amp; k@@ de ; termination of a song , KM@@ id starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open to Open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can choose the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and pressing the button you play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu piece or run the blank button .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window pull it to a collection and then re@@ played on each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is playing , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ ad and thus change the play@@ back speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the whit@@ eness has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the kno@@ cking like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , so breaks the play@@ back . pressing the whit@@ eness while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back .
lyrics can be saved on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use Tex@@ ter@@ ei@@ i , others use lyrics , and again others both . some pieces have no text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically selected , so that you have to manually set up a song , so that you will automatically choose the kar@@ a@@ oke text automatically . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or rec@@ itals . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in the row . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , open the collection manager . this is where you will find the collection manager under the point .... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the required collection managers .
in the temporary collection , all songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . if you add many pieces to you .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the button Add a song , with whose help you can choose the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic added to the collection .
when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece to open ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically added to the active collection .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , in opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and integrated . this collection will then be added to the attached pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series according to the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu collections , the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the Collec@@ ting manager , or use the selection list via the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song further , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or push the arrow to the right .
to reverse a song back@@ wards , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece out of the menu piece or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Del@@ eting .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter as it is when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it will not be saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI Map General @-@ MIDI Events in events that synthes@@ izer the synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ um@@ pet , and thus always be a trumpet , if originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , do not need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl@@ . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI Map is a text file , which saves all the necessary conver@@ sions for the play of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your Map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , how the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equ@@ ations is ignored . it is thought that the GM -@@ Patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay down all notes that support this instrument ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . to do this in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( tissue output ) , it occupies patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch included the patch is meant by which each sound represents a different perception instrument ( Drum , basin , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one , in which the sound level the ton@@ gs of the always the same drum means ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how tones are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the sequence of lines is very important , as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you just need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used above all to make notes on the per@@ ch channel . check out as an example of the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to trade for example the first and second channel , make it easy in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion to a particular channel ( general MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
Midi devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will naturally continue to be defined in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored that change the patch on this channel . in this case , then , patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the Persian patch on the Persian channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o adm@@ its to which relation to Pit@@ ch Ben@@ ding events multip@@ lied with the value n , this will be re@@ funded with the formula * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then first passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used , so that in the map file no dec@@ imal must be no dec@@ imal ) .
this setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ out event gets higher to play with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; walking around .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . this can be found in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series of cla@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cla@@ vi@@ atures see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the Kan@@ al@@ view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument , lights the button not more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the can@@ al@@ view has ( up to now ) two different views to indicate the played notes . view the View menu under the point of Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the pace , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can comp@@ el anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you have to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually .
agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
previously , you necessarily activate the setting automatic added to the collection . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can click the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the play@@ back . to restore the standard speed you can double @-@ click on the LCD double .
I have a &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this way I have to play a MIDI file ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; pull .
if you only want to listen to a file fast , without adding them to a collection , turn the setting automatic add to the collection and the new one ; file will add to temporary collection added to open files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ D . first you only want to play the first file . so imagine the setting automatic added to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me that , further to &amp; mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I &apos;m trying to take a little time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as hob@@ bies , I have program , MIDI files , making music and prove sentences .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ a@@ oke files if you want a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ vel .@@ es
you really feel a great pleasure if you want to send me a postcard from your residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact friends by &amp; k@@ mid . before you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by anybody for making money che@@ ered . I therefore would like to emphasize that I only get further program@@ mi@@ ere because / if I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - rep@@ airing the error , that the Ton@@ er at A@@ we @-@ Cards was too high .

and of course , my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
additionally it can be found on his homepage , which is found on htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ ker@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can watch the development , find information and look at pictures . there are also links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc .
a sound@@ card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same as you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
if you have no sound card , you will have to compile a sound card ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you would have a sound card , except that you can of course no music .
if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files used by M@@ player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please check the page The KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu book@@ marks but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which will be played after each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and the play@@ back begins with the added entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and perman@@ t playlist can also be changed by direct editors of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category Cli@@ cks to choose from the menu view and next editing mode . by the cli@@ ent@@ ment of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select from the menu the same with playlist , and select either the editing mode , or another category is selected .
all changes will be lost when the working mode is left , or another group is selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during star@@ ters and ending can be disabled by editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c and changing from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player : will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation at star@@ ters does not need to be short , it will automatically be termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be interfer@@ ing at the end @-@ animation but the user can end the application for a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; verb@@ s ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / k@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; ; / sm@@ il@@ ds ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ds ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ds ; are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player .
there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . here , the path can be adjusted from the M@@ player and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for de@@ bug@@ ging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this play@@ back in the Con@@ figuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player . everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c , just as the setting of the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted in the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player can reproduce the &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player has to be set as a service provider for the M@@ IME @-@ Type , / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles , and search error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the starting process is called kn@@ p@@ player . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
this is always taken a given back@@ end for a specific M@@ IME type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example , phon@@ on all og@@ g files will be re@@ formed :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using a player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner needs to be used and the TV channels can be configured , or configuration file can be edited manually .
to Con@@ figuration of the V@@ DR ( Video Personal Rek@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player is the dialog under the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected by which one is selected ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it .
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video devices under Linux is the only functions working ) . this is also necessary only on the first screen ( : 0.@@ 0 ) . this is also necessary for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally are used by KM@@ players for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ iting source , source code , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist .
are you hints as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive quie@@ ter if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is used as user root after joining the device . thereby , it is absolutely certain that / dev / CD@@ ROM is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU need to be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ d@@ d. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time it will test the CPU .

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphic user @-@ surfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling of &amp; k@@ ile ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be trac@@ ed to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or te@@ tex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution should be included . for installation , documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD can be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains several already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are available on the k@@ ile ; -@@ website .
this manual is available for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; che@@ que ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation is needed , the contact with the web site should be made .
step questions or when comp@@ iling by &amp; k@@ ile ; on or will be desired , this should be addressed at the mailing list @-@ de@@ vel @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Cl@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; l@@ atex ; functions for the &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling , editing and error tools for this . in conclusion should be the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his choices should be drawn to K@@ ate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .

just as other distinctive languages includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the general features such as paper format , side @-@ numbered and text gr@@ ind with the text . the introduction includes at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the caus@@ al starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ by { document } .
the quick entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a true function for the quick creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the choice of ass@@ istants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ¼ ) offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document . it can also be made some of the settings related to the document .
documentation : this will be the type of the document displayed : articles ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , articles ( DIN ) &#91; S@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; Sa@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ ans &#93; or custom .
code : this is hereby to be used the string coding of the system . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . if the UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for proper processing of l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most used additional packages for l@@ atex ; for the integration they are only about in the cross field .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users have now to worry about it . only a brief description of the functions and further information can be given in the section .
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just as other source code editors - the emergence of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by doing so , it is possible to notice any mathematical environment . however , you may notice it by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you through the amount of time and out of the output .
with automatic processing of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { Command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically a blank line ( for entering the text ) , and the related line to the lock@@ ers of the instruction is created ( e.g. \ \ \ by { Command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu set ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; inherited the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most common and sub@@ stit@@ ched element ) :
in the view of the document in the struc@@ turing , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse @-@ click on the one .
when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; through a click with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the l@@ atex ; source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF format type of &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for various systems and tann@@ ins .
when using the rack , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file connected with the editor is the exact opposite section . once on a section in the l@@ atex ; source code has been clicked , becomes the corresponding location in the DV@@ I ; the viewer was sponsored .
master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . using a master document the work with other included .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project project settings .
rapid building : the l@@ atex @-@ code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed ( if no errors in source code are available ) .
file alert : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; -@@ file to be ri@@ pped , and there is no call from &amp; eye@@ piece ; after the rapid building .
when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large sections of the choice should be noted . the selection fields have been designed for the fast layout of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The sub@@ ver@@ able &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field More is for entries of articles such as tags , fox , notes , or references . the options are :
name : with this command a name for a section , an image or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field ) .
when using c@@ itation , a selection list will be displayed with literary ones . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written also in &amp; k@@ ile ; from hand .
the final selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for determining the font size . it can be specified the font for the main text , the fox , notes etc . there are the following fon@@ ts to cover :
in the call of &amp; k@@ ile ; two choices are available for sale : 1 . the wiz@@ ards for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and set up settings . 2 . the document can be written from reason to hand .
the brac@@ kets after the command \ \ &apos; s class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; puts the font . the font does not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the Men@@ Ã s Tree or the Kno@@ pf@@ s Schnell@@ construction .
the code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; k@@ ile , the storage is automatically saved .
thanks to the comp@@ iling of the document , should be searched for the errors . when using rapid construction should &amp; eye@@ piece should be started . if this is not the case , should also be considered the log @-@ proof .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size 12 creates and only a few pieces should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ by { environment } . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ by } environment } .
the devices are merely within the area ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ by { environment } ) . there is no compl@@ ying ( number ) for those who work in an environment .
there are many possibilities to obtain the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fat pressure , cur@@ ant pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . added either by the command \ \ by order or automatically at the end of the surroundings .
\ \ begin { empiri@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long until he is closed with a \ \ \ { empiri@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be represented with \ \ empiri@@ h { word } .
\ \ &apos; : created a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ by { rate } .
after the background to writing the source text with the l@@ atex ; indic@@ ative language was represented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ;
once the assistant has entered a bit of text , some adjustments should be accomplished for the better legi@@ bility of the document . therefore , at least one quotation , a few places in fat and short @-@ pressure and a poem can come to the application to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , using editor View , or C@@ tr@@ l may be back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; post@@ script ; / PDF file will be converted . just try out and fun .
DV@@ I ; is an active file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ s. ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi version such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Um@@ wand@@ ler or computer screen .
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . by clicking on DV@@ I , the document can be printed by file Dru@@ cken ( in the viewer ) ( provided the printer is correct ) .
the tool@@ bar is the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; -@@ file from the l@@ atex ; source code has been created , the conversion can begin in random other formats using the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar .
the curtains for the direct jump from the editor for the related position within the DV@@ I ; -@@ file .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; for this purpose only modern settings have to set up the settings ... tools building will be used .
to locate the pros , the mouse @-@ cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and is ev@@ acu@@ ated on pre@@ loc@@ alities . the jump to the corresponding location in the DV@@ I ; the viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; eye@@ piece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; k@@ ile ; available and set on the corresponding line .
should the use of rapid construction of the &amp; DV@@ I ; spect@@ ator does not exist , can be a mistake . should an error appear , this will be shown in the log file or in the news window .
the log file is the error source in the source code . in the editor you can always see the line earlier , in which the error appears . to view the faul@@ ty line , must be clicked on the error in the log @-@ on and &amp; k@@ ile ; jump to the faul@@ ty line .
once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document . the options listed are :
if you choose from empty document a document can be written either from scratch or the wiz@@ ard to fast creation of a new document . more information can be included in the section .
regular users of l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates , can be saved in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , you need to create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file ge@@ ff@@ net or a new file will be created . &amp; Cl@@ ile ; can create a new template using any existing document and selection of file template .
when creating a new document from a template using file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings in settings ... settings General will be set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering documents . typically , it will be used as the following files : \ \ &apos; class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CL@@ AS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wiz@@ ard and the entry into the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps were taken :
when creating a new document may then be the template &apos;s own template instead of default .
a template can be created from any l@@ atex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; used as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and emergence of many different types of text files ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for you can be made directly from &amp; k@@ ile .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his opportunities to know should be drawn to K@@ ate &apos;s manual . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; could start there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
&amp; k@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which may be called the Men@@ ja help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find an exceptional description of almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with paved C@@ tr@@ l button to cover the &amp; tex ; meaning that this way will be used when clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s only \ \ par .
when pulling the text with penetr@@ ated lin@@ ker , the text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow buttons , you can get parts of the source code in the editing pane .
&amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most different types of swelling and this highlight . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ulas are highlighted by another color .
lots of ass@@ istants may have their own jumping marks . these are a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entry is highlighted the jump to the most or last spring@@ board . thereby , this jumping stamp is highlighted , so that it is automatically yellow at the first input of a sign .
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions have been added in &amp; k@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; swelling items have been added . &amp; l@@ atex ; ben@@ ding always many environments and groups and therefore sub@@ merged . &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands to their selection . by editing , the following commands are included :
for a complete paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line ) . this extended meaning is not meant by a text with all text lines ( as in other text editor ) . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; k@@ ile ; is that the only explo@@ iting thing are separated by two empty lines .
according to the current Cur@@ sor@@ position , this selection also has an extended importance , since this command also l@@ atex ; commands with an area @-@ shaped ( * ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
for finishing a part of the document may be removed from this first and by wir@@ es the button de@@ f . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the keyboard short@@ cut c@@ tr@@ l ; K with the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides with its own commands to contain a faster result . under editing , the following commands contain :
removed a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of editing paragraph ( in paragraph ) .
it has already been clari@@ fies that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile offers additional commands under editing environment for a profitable simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
with this command , for the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the front door .
with this command , at the end of the current environment , no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the surrounding area .
if the cursor is in front or within the instruction \ \ &apos; begin { surroundings } , the end of the surrounding area is pr@@ é@@ ed ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many spar@@ ed ambient commands may be quickly lost . this command slept quickly the last environment , so the van@@ ized ambient structure is not broken .
&amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by brac@@ kets { ... } are a few important commands that correspond to those made of editing environment .
with this command becomes the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp .
with this command is sponsored by the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the rolling cl@@ amp .
if the cursor from or behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many inter@@ tw@@ isted groups @-@ brac@@ kets can quickly be lost as soon as possible . this command slept quickly the last group , so that the snow@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not broken .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; two simple instructions are used as a device . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple an@@ esthe@@ tic signs is used . moreover , the sign &quot; for two simple an@@ esthe@@ tic signs is used . also , the sign &quot; for two simple application marks is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and for two slept @-@ up characters for l@@ atex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of double results can be set up under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X - and they are exhausted .
it can also be used to use specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French characteristics . there are also many more languages available .
in the wir@@ ing of Shift ; input button , an intelligent line of line . if the current position is located within a list of lists ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ates or item@@ ize ) , for example , not only a line break@@ up but also the command \ \ item .
inside a tables environment , you can spend the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjoining toe nails .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to put pre @-@ set &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to under@@ mines . these can be found under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
some users complain the columns in tables , environments and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) each other with each other . while this tab@@ ulator is not included ; after the most common tab@@ ulator in the following line . although this tab@@ ulator is not the case , for some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ulator .
although &amp; K@@ ate ; already a good source code has been completed ; in order to have special commands ( usually for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) are still extended . there are three different modes implemented . these are three depending on the need , and the other two are for automatic transmission . all these modes can be set up to different ways of working under settings .
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ &apos; begin { environment } is set &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically the command \ \ by { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
while wir@@ ing the R@@ Ã ¼ ck button , the last letter of the entry is removed and is therefore the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering another letter too .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be noted , so that a simple jump to these positions by means of editing mar@@ ks N@@ Ã ¶ ff@@ est ski stamp is possible and the well @-@ known parameters can be introduced .
under settings , set up ... k@@ ile ; obj@@ ection@@ able settings can be made to these lists . there may be different W@@ Ã s lists for &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; commands , as well as wine orders of the general language used .
the command mode is ready for completion of environments . it &apos;s always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of contrac@@ eption mode will have a rough list with ambient light . on the other hand , the environments will often be used that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for the completion of the environment .
when calling the ful@@ ler mode of editing , the menu is automatically frozen , the command is automatically frozen out of the environment and it appears \ \ begin { . after that the environment can be completed and by wir@@ ing the entry button are termin@@ ated .
once this is accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a lists of environment , even a first \ \ item command will be introduced .
under settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; obj@@ ection@@ able settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the wh@@ ist@@ ling list of the complete mode for man@@ tex ; - and l@@ atex ; commands .
&amp; k@@ ile ; underestimated user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can immediately set up using settings . the lists can be set up under settings . as an example of an absorption list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X contain .
for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word convertible mode is introduced to the volume of editing , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
rough whales are not helpful for automatic transmission . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter in a document are written more than once . this offers &amp; k@@ ile ; the completion for all already written hands .
this mode can be set in the Men@@ Ã ¼ inch settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ ful@@ ler . here , the swelling value can be set for the display of the susp@@ ects .
the contrac@@ eption files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p@@ ile / complete / mode / complete / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode version ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .
the dialog graphics designed the introduction of graphics as simple as possible . to complete the basis of the basics of the graphics should be the sections and looked at .
PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for downloading and new app@@ ings of pages . will the PDF output can be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are new arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
to watch the outcome of the work , it must be compiled in the source code . all the building tools are group@@ ed in the menu creation , creating converting and creating view summar@@ ized .
for the comp@@ iling of the swelling of the viewer , like &amp; eye@@ piece ; or the other conversion can be the keyboard number ; 2 used , by Alt ; 4 the DV@@ I ; -@@ file converted into a PS file and using Alt ; 5 the PS file will be viewed .
when using the command above , there is usually called a viewer after the comp@@ iling . should not be used a one @-@ connected viewer , so every time will be a new window .
a new project will be introduced to the project New Project .... the following information is asked for the project :

this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is attached to the current folder folder . if not , then remove the current folder @-@ folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time when I was pro@@ c .
as already said , anyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select current work@@ folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is available .
when it comes to output on the screen , your file is fla@@ wed . please check the errors and try again .
if the testing file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then they leave current file simply attached . if not , delete it with current file the tick and select the file to re@@ viewing file via other file - file selection .

enter the name of the file , as the result is named , to . the file is usually stored in their home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have had little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until someone can use the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; built . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more information can be found below .
to install a plugin or part , we start with the menu plug@@ ins . thus , the following dialogue will be opened :
this dialog allows to manage all the plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :

we often work on one project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as sub@@ project manager .
the user can choose even from the list of members who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and the button ign@@ ite as expresses . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears to be : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on comments .
beside the overview of their team there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event created for information to the team leader , if something happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that will be executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would work out how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is secured , or a script that plays a file into CV@@ S once it is added to the project &amp; etc .
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Dialog@@ es can be modified and deleted .
an e @-@ mail is sent to the addres@@ see list selected at the recipient of the addres@@ see . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i will be set up such ladder .
notes are special comments in the documents . they are different from normal comments through the following things :
type notes is simple . it can be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by a Com@@ prehen@@ sive text .
notes may be sent to a given member of the team . in this case , syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nickname of the manager of the team member is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team manager for the divisions and sub@@ project leaders should be cited as in the following examples below .
nickname and roles @-@ names are independent of large or small sp@@ elling , but spaces around the br@@ aces and the : make the note invali@@ d .

large / sp@@ elling of attributes @-@ bu@@ ts : large / small sp@@ elling of automatically printed attributes . normal Groß / sp@@ elling means , the attributes are as inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the end date is optional , this immediately following the bed .
non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above for any other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
start @-@ up and finish tag automatically update : if enabled , the appropriate day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic yield of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during inser@@ tion .
M@@ IME types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es to detect various types of files . using the default button , the default variables can be recovered .
standard string code : enco@@ ding from newly created or in other ways than using file opening files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file may be passed ) , but this setting will be displayed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized , but this setting will be installed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in a black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even if not stored documents , a backup is regularly created , according to the specified time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or a private view ( or the documentation in a cardboard ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings back to the next start is useful when the user interface through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cken / depend on views of each other . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout Command Line parameters .
the warning messages -@@ section serves the taxes of the possibility to question the display of warnings through attacks by no more questions .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the code view in shared mode . in terms of different modes see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the representation of the par@@ ser @-@ knot@@ s in the document .
in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible , which can change by clicking the structural tree with the mouse clicks .
in the field of structural adjustment settings , the visibility of knot@@ s in tree , editing and how deep in changing the structural tree is to be opened automatically , while empty groups are the empty areas in the text , while blank groups such are , in which in the current document there was no element found .
the range to the determination of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folded in editing to extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are in groups , each can give a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ lange abbrevi@@ ation slightly different means as in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ Application of d@@ rit@@ ter page , which can be re@@ used by every single part @-@ capable application , at the most famous &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins must be specified the following :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard there like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin at the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; Only &quot; L@@ ese &quot; mode to load : check if the plugin is denied boarding . only @-@ L@@ ese K@@ Parts will not refuse the store when this option is not chosen .
check the plugin : if this is activated , then tes@@ ters &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the provided information is correct , even if the plug @-@ in is not available in the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the troubles@@ hooting was completely re@@ designed . the support for the non @-@ built @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Debug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the db@@ g Debug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin was implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations over plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for use &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger @-@ Plugin selection , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all semi @-@ points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is usually shown in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , or she shares the plug @-@ in with , on debit requests . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened , that normally does not need to be respected in the normal case .
the counter@@ part to de@@ bug@@ ging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the sounds to requirements .
send a HTTP requirement to the server to submit a debit requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of scrip@@ ting variables as well as current information on the surveillance variables as well as the current line . if this happens , while the script is stopped , the execution will continue before the script starts , starts the script with the request .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information on surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script exp@@ ired , the execution goes on . happens before a debit request is given , the execution begins once a request is provided .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script without entering the functions or includes .
the de@@ bu@@ gger introduces the next directive in the script , where if possible in functions and it will be er@@ ased in faul@@ ty .
indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next one as if there is the current one .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the over@@ looked value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can custom@@ ize &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document Edi@@ ting Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; abilities such as car completion and no@@ dal trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes off &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the market @-@ up languages and family 2 , the script folders and the work@@ flows . tag folders are handy , symbol@@ ised Le@@ aders of image scar@@ p ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) to insert the text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever be .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be made manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see in details for the conversion .
this document describes how to create tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also work@@ flows . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alogues ; the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c . file lists the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . work@@ flows allow quick inser@@ ting tags in a document without a risk of writing errors .
day folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the read language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible , so that other users will have better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple manner .
this is the root element of a conference document . it can only contain once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but it contains as only one element type on itself otherwise .
type of tags is a script function . when using is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; An argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for day@@ type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for Type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method is owned . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a Commons Attri@@ bution , and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag is determined . that is a only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . additionally , there are additional tags , describing how this attribute is to be shown &amp; etc . this is a only element type element .
returns the source codes used for the attributes in the day @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for achieving source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology . the arguments that are passed to the method . can be empty or % day &apos;s name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container @-@ day that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is a single element type element .
defines the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( for example for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue once ( for example , one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a only element type .
there is a list of elements to end a day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files need to start with one &amp; XML ; declaration declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 en@@ umer@@ ation = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ased and closed properly .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced . this will cause no leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
for checking the tag@@ XML files , the tools should launch above in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check class X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place at charging the equ@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the file name of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; default &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ file is as fairly simple and there is an editor that can be processed via D@@ T@@ D ; for one of a list of sel@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are created :
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as Nick@@ name .
an action can be set up with settings ... click on New action leads to the same dialogue :
this action is assigned key short@@ cuts . by clicking the button user interface can be assigned a keyboard short@@ cut ; with K@@ one is the current keyboard short@@ cuts .
the simplest actions . it can be inserted a text in the detailed settings and in exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but on it it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) to be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even are the Quick start @-@ Dialog or the various Look into ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter should be specified . for example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting Vari@@ able in the command line : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file name is removed : / out of the document name .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; process replaced by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is attached to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods can take a script from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on the default entry . in the selection field input can be determined what to send to the standard input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exec@@ uting application can be re@@ directed . there are two types of issue : normal output written to the standard error . it can be specified , which is to be done with the text written on the default issue , by the value the selection field will be set :
if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . in the case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you have to add and configure actions . select Settings promotions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action Kno@@ pf@@ es at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching tool@@ bar .
complete all and , if the day attributes has and you plan their use , activate the dialog box if available , so that an input in the operation of the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is it a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use of the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created icon will not only help you notice what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starter button as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start @-@ up in the current document .
after the creation of the symbol it still needs to be connected with the action . this happens via the menu with attitudes actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ endi@@ x button and set them with other tags , so there is still which indicates , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to tool@@ bar , or it should be allocated to a better overview by some Tren@@ ner in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to adjust dialog using settings . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left above ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , it is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar .
please note how separ@@ ators support the group . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proxy of all symbols , to make sure everything works .
secure in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , it will be used im@@ regular folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your tool@@ bar ( s ) will be loaded ( s ) if a file is opened by the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check out in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository check if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc . language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we will leave you , the second we treat it here .
# KDE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc 1 = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 1.0 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html , 2 = volume 2.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc 1 = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level : top element = PHP 4.2 Interface Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess tele@@ phones ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and more consequ@@ ent at the top of the building view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is intended for the design of the context @-@ sensitive assistance . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the connection lines .
a simple list of separated separated context elements , which should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / p / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / or / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are confident that these are good and worth it , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation has been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web developer platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the remot@@ est resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , work@@ flows with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an e @-@ mail send menu entry , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates , and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be reviewed and only available when our team needs them to be correct and use@@ full for publication . to sign@@ alize the resources , which ensures a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private GP@@ G key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can request a out . in dialogue New resource you have to pass out the input fields ( URL preview can stay empty ) and with clicking on OK the up@@ loading will be started .
the up@@ loading can upload from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ pac@@ ket ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ ing tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts .
after downloading a resource , even before installation , investig@@ ating &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signal . in case of problems , it can be broken down . if the integrity are given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in day XML format could be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and Conver@@ ting of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which is to be used . after that , the following dialogue appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / p / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definitions : the string that is within ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , such as HTML Public / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ d@@ d should appear
setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so that chapter needs to be familiar with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to bring them precisely these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and proj@@ ect@@ . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . by work@@ flows through actions it is all that is used as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators different work@@ flows , actions and patterns in the global tree that will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are custom pattern and work@@ flows . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to work@@ flows with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all the elements are stored in the folder of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project em@@ ö@@ g@@ licht .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editing window , the building views , the Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites with information and the tool@@ bar . please suggest you in , and for further information about these areas .
you can click on the cardboard button with the right mouse button to re@@ load a text menu with the current doctrine , like close the current , other or all cart@@ els , re@@ load , delete or load up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Edi@@ tor@@ ques lead to a further context menu regarding the revised document content , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing of the mouse @-@ cursor , help to the word under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , if the string is called under the mouse cursor .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ fen@@ sters are the tool@@ bar of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of work@@ flows will be shown . in the course of further development of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs .
the use of work@@ flows is really easy . if you want to insert it into your document , then click on the icon that represents the day . now , they can insert the data for this just added day . if they want to insert one day , which has multiple attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and wander through . in the presentation with Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites stand for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation Bau@@ man@@ views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project using right mouse @-@ click . actions such as add , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from memory medium can be done with the context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open .
templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the category is always available , local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates are only usable in the project . more to templates is available .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking on the right mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with e @-@ mail .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links to an element the cursor is set in the document on the position of the element . through right @-@ clicking of an element it opens up a list of commands with regard to navigation and refres@@ her tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ ic attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can be changed . this allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation for developing web @-@ technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ pac@@ ed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added to project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ on @-@ rated at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this cart@@ on shows information about each in Qu@@ anta current script . thus , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document used and all changes to D@@ T@@ D are shown .
this box rider shows all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work@@ flows are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ col@@ on of the tool@@ bar is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends out the tool@@ bar as the kom@@ mier@@ ed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they get a tool@@ bar in an e @-@ mail , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has given a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . to give a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here do not run .
if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H before their bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web @-@ development tool for the KDE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for rapid Web @-@ development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , expand@@ able mark@@ up languages would ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limits , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tools . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then there should be &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this , the appropriate &amp; IDE mode .
well , to the above claim has to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follow , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ st is not only this all possible , but allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers the usage of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program compres@@ ses they can have to expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; expand , without remembering a scrip@@ ting language . ( more about that they find in . )
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web@@ develop@@ ement environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for rapid development development and has been expanded rapidly to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .

a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not taken out , whereby the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside of the local / project template , only one error is reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting out the cli@@ p@@ board there special characters to the &amp; HTML ; check @-@ up , so that it is displayed correctly and not to be mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting system .

switches the block selection to or from . that allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift ; taste .
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined phrases to help you .
displays the news window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
initial and turning of the problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as you switch to the structural tree .
displays the tool@@ sp@@ old left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse @-@ click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed after the fil@@ en@@ ames of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file turn .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects can be explained in detail .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bar and are available only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this will only create the name . actions need to set up your name . actions are stored about work@@ flows , store and you will be asked by asking if you want to store the tool@@ bar .
remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . that del@@ etes them not from the disk . if you don &apos;t yet have stored the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you would like to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team , so that the tool@@ bar in the next publication is available ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bar to the main server , where anyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description .
loading / stri@@ ps of the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; is sensible if the entities are from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global one is not present and a ty@@ pe@@ at in the global KDE folder is not present , fails to shop .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently charged tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ ting of tags . intelligent , this means only using ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent obj@@ ections means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar is denied if this day is contradic@@ ting the rules this place .

checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; using the external application tidy .
instant switching between the different types of user interface . through some limitations in the KDE libraries , it can sometimes need time or un@@ beautiful graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu features an entry for every open sub@@ window . with the selection of a tra@@ der , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated .
displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog influenced any application that use the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; Web@@ browser .
set the behaviour of the editing pane . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar or which can add or change the sequences .
this should produce a help in accordance with the mouse environment , but it is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled best from top to bottom , as after filling the project called the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project project properties can be adjusted .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name file , file is automatically filled .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server &apos;s server , to which you want to access , one , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
lets this field empty , the default settings of the chosen log can be used . depending on the setup of the remote host , an adaptation could be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar is stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bar . if a shared collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of standards .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . it can be selected multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
accused , if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are to be involved . if a project is started from scratch , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all of the files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of your th@@ inner .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files through folders or , using the tick , cl@@ amps out of the project .
the final screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can upload automatically in the menu with project properties in the menu window profiles , or using the short@@ cut shift ; F@@ 7 can be changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) , which are re@@ ignored in project @-@ related operations such as the project folder .
supple@@ mentary option to above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is charged at opening the project . in may more be read about project insights .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the Debug@@ ger Plugin can be adjusted with the button Options . in case the bug fixes is described .
in the sub@@ window profiles up@@ loaded high @-@ profile profiles ( see in ) are set , as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile , showing a separate building view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details .
in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions will be executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see in the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior cannot currently affect .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files happens when you load a new project .
the project developers gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files in the current project can be managed .
folder behave just as well , however , the entries are missing and Open with ... in the right button of the right @-@ click context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the site of the up@@ loaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only more one profile is present , the button is lo@@ wered to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and be forgotten by programmer . this possibility is useful when common up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather uns@@ afe password on the record is not available in question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ profile profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded onto different servers . editing or creating a profile will be displayed this dialog :
this is the name of the server that should be copied to the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ io slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual Port .
depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it according to your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be published in a project many views , i.e. by simply changing the view , different files and work@@ flows can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bar .
views can be stored or deleted in the menu Project or the Project @-@ tool@@ bar , accessible or deleted via settings of tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only boost productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; on its own way of working .
as mentioned above , work@@ flows in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best mentioned above the menu tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ in . adding work@@ flows will be dealt with in the section &quot; Add of work@@ flows . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the symbols on this can either be set up using the text menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can remove , ren@@ ame or work@@ flows , what can be stated in the dialog , where actions on this or other tool@@ bar may be visible .
through the call of the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition the entries are removed and action to be processed , the self @-@ explan@@ atory are .
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bar ... and set up attitudes actions ..
templates are included in essential documentation , code buck@@ les and files to combine . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates , basically like a common file system with expan@@ sive organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or any existing directory in the pad@@ stack . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you are preparing for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template .
bin@@ ar is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be included any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; bin@@ aries are usually inserted in documents using short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available under global templates . further information on the Tem@@ plates is available .
documents can be created by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , special rum@@ st for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a appropriate way to efficiently be efficient . some examples can be found in the col@@ lagen tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text range is always included in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete quantity system on Javascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the pre@@ fix tree under global templates . see for more information on the templates tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a comp@@ ress tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
create a document structure by choice ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File To save as a template .
once that happened , you notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) , the template is not visible in the proj@@ ec@@ ycle . check in the pre @-@ tree under proj@@ ections .
select text in your document and click on file to store your choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be used with pulling and shut@@ down on the building style templates .
the creation of bin@@ aries is simple : to copy the file only into a sub@@ folder @-@ folder . it can be used to use all file administration functions , such as pulling and deriv@@ ative or inser@@ tion over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or .
you can select in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , the project folder will be secured , but of course it can be stored as local or global template .
proj@@ ections allow a very target @-@ oriented programming language . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; design , paste files or connect with them . in addition , one can keep in mind some things in the use of templates in projects very profound .
the basic structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files presented in the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / p / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates / etc / qu@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates / tem@@ anta / templates /
to set the behaviour of a folder in the template , click on the folder and select in the context menu features . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ elled as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes exp@@ ired .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the pres@@ criptions . if a stem folder would be so adjusted , unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like Text @-@ Bau@@ stein . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a stem folder .
allowed or set up text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ lines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equi@@ p a folder with special head@@ lines , foot@@ er lines , and can equi@@ p each presentation with the matching head@@ lines .
in addition , you have a right mouse menu ( to indicate the right mouse button ) about a complete command of buttons for the Add of folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; - Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode will replace the source Editor through the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second window will divide the editor window into two parts : the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and switch on if necessary for the source code Editor , in which the changes carried out in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document , which &amp; PHP ; contains a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ ion of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in the source Editor and the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible in the source Editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will be activated , this mode is already active , the keyboard shift from one window to another , whereby the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation gap between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source Editor is adjustable to settings Qu@@ anta settings .... After choosing V@@ PL ; you can select between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to time . basically , the recommendation applies : a small gap for quick calcul@@ ator and a large range for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called upon as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor will also be called the reduction of the hanging code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. head@@ words for Internet search@@ engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list enables the change of content , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word keywords key@@ word on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change on the list is possible just as with the met@@ a @-@ elements possible . editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing on the file button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor operates as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of reg@@ ress or removal .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source editor . it is to be noted that the inser@@ ting of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text , each other embr@@ aced anchor tag should be removed .
some work@@ flows such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must use the tables or lists work@@ flows .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of styles . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style can be pursued .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successful compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are available in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

there are many graphical tools for comparisons . so why &amp; Do 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes and simultaneously in many places the objection had been corrected . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts when connecting .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the objection had changed . that &apos;s how these changes were a little nightmare .
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; sounded 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , plenty of more useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare fast text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the previous window .
a function made a lot of work was the same and assemb@@ ling of folders . this function turned to &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; nearly into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way together is fully supported . this is useful when two people are working independently of a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three qu@@ ell files in the process :
&amp; sounded 3 ; helps you also at the same and assemble complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ icks 3 ; with the folder @-@ together :
&amp; sounded 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve in addition to the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are visible . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no hassle any more , if Yemen and the objection changes . )
when a file is identical , and the other differs in a line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make the ti@@ p@@ par@@ able work immediately by using only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file completely . example :
diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o target folders
the opening dialog allows manual input of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection over the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last updated file from the list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you don &apos;t have the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is conducted .
about the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparisons or assemb@@ ling of folders . if for A file is selected , for B and C , a folder , then used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the two other folders .
if we merge together , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately . you can take this step later on saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with settings . here you can specify options before starting with the comparisons / merge .
sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; # 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts then immediately . in opening dialog , you need to select no files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use goat and drop : drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
what idea is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how much these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to upload two appropriate files to load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare it . now you can copy the relevant sections simply , paste and then compare .
note : currently you can &apos;t drag nothing out &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; only the tr@@ ap@@ tion of text in a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and deriv@@ ative of text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such cases , your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window , the info @-@ line of the source window contains the signs A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while on the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed over the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees in color , which file differs . if both files differ , the pre@@ dominant color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) well .
links next to the text is the summar@@ izing column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the processor and in few , rare items . )
the vertical line which separates the contrac@@ tion column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line change is activated , the line is dot@@ ted to broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparative windows ) also has a info line with the ins@@ cription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; when you have finished the result . usually , it contains by automatic merge already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , save is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons , to n@@ igh@@ tly solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparisons windows are used , each difference can also be solved at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( thus , a jump of position in the windows is displayed , where the beginning of the group will otherwise not be visible . ) This group will then highlighted the paint background color for current area and each one on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes the automatic merge or by manual editing no more line will be left in the group ; then there is only a place holder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a markings that you might have to copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; exec@@ utable ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if you select the sources the options ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
this navig@@ ates mainly with the mouse drives and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrows on the left , end , end , shr@@ g @-@ beginning and shr@@ g end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the crossing column beside the vertical picture bar can also be used for navigation .
in the Aug@@ mentation window you can also use the other buttons for editing . using the inser@@ ting button you can switch between inser@@ ting and trans@@ writ@@ able mode . ( pre @-@ set is the inser@@ tion mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summar@@ ize columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the section and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / former difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Strasbourg image ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , it must be resolved between sol@@ dered and un@@ resolved conflicts .
to copy the markings to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this is enabled , whatever you select , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and install the manual Kop@@ er . be careful with this option but you could see the content of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dentally .
row will be saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix @-@ versions use a row sign \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car back \ \ r \ \ \ \ \ \ . K@@ decker 3 keeps the line @-@ end of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; box 3 ; also not using bin@@ der files .
the options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu inclusion - &gt; K@@ decker 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . )
when you activate this option , differences are shown in short script . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be shown . on these systems the button pres@@ ets will automatically set an odd color .
when activated , when this option is activated , when selecting the tab@@ ulator button , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator sign is inserted .
when entering or return , the entry of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line .
when activated , each selection will automatically copy into the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which line @-@ type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly usual selection on the used operating system .
in the comparisons of files you have tried &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; first to be all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . also , the white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a wagon look &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a row slide &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others can only save a row sign @-@ page comparison , but then you could use files with different sizes on the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then you could be treated differently . while joining together , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is de@@ activated .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are nevertheless shown , but they are treated like white characters .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in the Autom@@ atically re@@ viewing mode , this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source . ( pre @-@ set manual sel@@ ections . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need to use it from time to time , then use the automatic selection also in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated .
these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning of folders and thorou@@ gh@@ ing a compilation . look for details on documentation for the directory comparison and compilation .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is app@@ en@@ ix .@@ or@@ ig . if such a back@@ up@@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ or@@ ig exists , it will be deleted without further backup .
adapting to the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current program . you must end and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; sounded 3 ; not available because the language is set aside over the control centre . )
the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , it is used for all entries the upper adjustment .
about the selection fields for enco@@ ding appears a short notice of what the local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has purely informal character . )
adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . since the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding is to be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Unic@@ ode , but the pre@@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can set the coding of the output of sub@@ cut@@ ters .
turn this in order to supp@@ ress her@@ al@@ izations of changes in white characters in the text or overview . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments are activated . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences between two of three files are displayed . however , you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to selecting A &amp; lt ; s ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ s ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ section ; C is displayed next to the normal nor a second crossing column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just skip the less important windows . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
orders the comparison side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window @-@ menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . a simple click starts the compilation and used the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as a registered name for the output file . ( if this function is used to collapse ) then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; # 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly your demands . you can use this function e.g. to cut disrup@@ tive parts or to correct the retro@@ fit .
when reading a file it is given first to this external command . if also a regular pre @-@ editing command is indicated ( see above ) , then the output of the command will only be used at Ze@@ il@@ der . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly your needs . each input line needs to have an associated issue line .
the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users would not want to program that . the good news is however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice .
use this Pre @-@ editor for Ze@@ il@@ der to convert the input into large letters : sed &apos; s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ &apos; s ) refers to the found text in the first clone string . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems are using the same pattern as a key@@ word ( info : / CV@@ S / key@@ word \ \ _ BA@@ R _ header \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions , even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ decker 3 . but it is good as an example of a further processing tool for Ze@@ il@@ ds straight . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every@@ one sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each other is replaced by nothing , so quasi .
sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l @-@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switch . however , for per@@ l some details are different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only ( and ) without the lead &quot; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal process processor will be kept for viewing and comp@@ iling . further operations only change the data that the Ze@@ il@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen .
note : in rare cases when you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the Ze@@ il@@ ab processor sees the output of the normal process processor as input .
the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can not acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case .
many times you need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; ks@@ .@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge .
... makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can it sim@@ ulate and displays the sim@@ ulated changes , without having to carry out
... runs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparisons and merge individual files very similar . you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder has been specified , use &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not to merge the composite , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you will receive a small news window of current progress . if you break the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that .
when scanning the folder is completed , displays &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side , ...
each file and each folder that has been found during the scan will be shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually combined together . you can double up a folder by clicking on the + / - clicking on the object , or use the arrow buttons on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories and use all sub@@ directories with which you can upload all folders and folders .
if you click a file , the file will start automatically and it appears to be a comparison window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folder , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object . in such cases , the merger action can not be automatically chosen . if that is started together , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
with identical contracts , the color is also identical , although the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their whole content is identical . then also folder the same color . at folders , the age is in@@ significant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a bl@@ at@@ ched again , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later when it is old , red is made .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this cannot be started .
the mode for synchron@@ isation is active if only two folder and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then choose &amp; kiss 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folder are identical . if necessary for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical are : merge together , and save the result into both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the merge copied &amp; glue 3 ; B after A. )
when two folders are merged and selecting the new file instead of joining together ( unsure ) then the exact date will appear , but the date is identical . if the files are different , but the date is identical . if such bugs have not been eliminated , the folder can not be started .
while joining together , a file will be processed after another . you state status column shows up , and according to other reports , when something un@@ expec@@ tedly appeared , you should make a final review and check whether the status is all right .
if in the setting dialog box the file comparative method is selected , K@@ ame 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only be displayed when three folders compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the joining together ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring it together .
please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then it is used in three @-@ folder mode C as the target used to merge in the two @-@ folder B as the target and used in synchron@@ isation A and / or B as destination .
if you have chosen a target folder , please check if all entries are displayed in the folder structure , also in the folder structure . there are some options through which certain entries might be ski@@ pped . check out these options to avoid un@@ ador@@ able surprises :
to merge all the entries : choose directories and continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to run only the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if the conflic@@ ting data still exist , a message appears to exist on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will appear with the options passing , sim@@ ulate and break .
select sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes are made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; sounded 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is needed ( merge a single file ) , then a composite window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select again directories / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then , it &apos;s running &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; on a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to jump the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select a different action for entry or solve the problem in a different way before joining together .
if some entries have been performed individually , you notice &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and results in later all entries . even if this has been compiled or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be assembled again .
the Settings menu of &amp; sounded 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory composition with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are shown in the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; separate space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( for example * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default folder must not correspond to that pattern .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be inserted more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be inserted more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ or@@ ig ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see at info : / CV@@ S / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files have an inheritance -@@ attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is down@@ lighted in the default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folder and re@@ recur@@ sively searched . ( note that a link to a folder that will contain a link to yourself would result in an end loop and de@@ diff@@ 3 ; cr@@ ashes down . ) This option is switched in the default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflict . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( insert an appropriate anti @-@ pattern )
when you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the amendment date and the file size . however , this speed costs does not cost you a certain level of safety . please use caution . this option is used in default .
it does not mean a real comparison . the files are considered to be identical if they are equally big . this can be useful for example when copying the amendment date . please use with caution . this option is used in default .
activ@@ ates synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions are selected , so that the two files are identical . also , the results of the composite files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain as it is provided that the other file is not also changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched in default .
if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , then the original version is ren@@ amed and gets deleted . if an old backup file with .@@ or@@ ig -@@ extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal composite of individual files , not just the composite folder . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folder @-@ composite view remains visible at the currency ; you can move the window partial with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window into window window in the window menu and switch from switching between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double @-@ clicking . however , there is a single file to merge directly without the folder menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to be done and the file will not merge once you start the folder .
however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : list menu : new to read
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for saving files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax , as local files and folders . a few things should be considered :
a path can be relative . or .. included . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be masks . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem on the server , sometimes through the protocol @-@ used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link is shown to a file or folder . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no possibility to edit privileges or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original . ( note the option confidential the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main purpose @-@ purpose is currently as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences viewer . to launch K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ ungs@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually required &amp; sounded 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a sound file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , the input file is a patch file in the Unix file . at least one of the two files must exist . then , starts &amp; kiss 3 ; the program patch will begin to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ decker 3@@ Part . also , this doesn &apos;t work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
when &amp; k@@ ills 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that &apos;s together or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the folder mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist is compact ) there are already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can be combined like the program diff@@ use 3 from the di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GPL @-@ programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or go to this way .
you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be notified to the correct pre@@ fix . in the default configuration settings in / usr / local , but then KDE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . you can find more information about this topic .
if only the number of white characters are different , these lines will be treated as identical ; if however , only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . IF similar lines of next to each other , this amaz@@ is is the purpose this is the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking the source code and select the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is easily saved as text file and it is much effort to design extra files that could save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger amounts of text should be used to use another editor .
after removing the text suddenly fl@@ us@@ hed ; no sr@@ c line@@ up ; and the text does not allow himself to delete . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; sounded 3 ; used already many colors to highlight the differences . even more heart would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new .
information about how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; -@@ distribution :
KDE gives you the folder in your system where KDE installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; Be@@ aches 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ aker used , you should not encounter any problems with the comp@@ iling . however , you should encounter difficulties , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing list thereof .
cutting ( C@@ tr@@ l or Shift ) copies into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Shift ) adds the text out of the cli@@ p@@ board at the current Cur@@ sor@@ position or replaces the current markings .
only differences display : files are identical in all folders and do not appear in the folder structure , and thus not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ examine changes to these options to the folder with the function Update . )
there are only entries to display the differences . this also leads to that identical files are not already copied into the target folder . if the target folders these files do not already contain , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons on selecting the source with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) , when clicking on the button are removed accordingly .
in the default setting , this option is de@@ activated . under@@ ball in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ show of all virtual working surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space , to change their size , stop them or move it . this works both within a desktop and with several .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; may display all virtual working surfaces as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked , if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has only the two entries to set up ... and loading . if however , click on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On desktop , and finishing . the commands do the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when clicked on an application .
if this cross @-@ box is marked , window within the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces .
if this field is crossed , in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual working surfaces are shown .
cross@@ wise this field leaves the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working surfaces can display . together with name , it is attached together with name , the names of folders , &amp; eg ; 1 . working space .
if this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the background .
if this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only the empty spaces are shown to allow them to choose from .
here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple calculations with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic and k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2@@ x@@ n @-@ R@@ aster appear , as well known as P@@ ager applications in some other Wind@@ ow@@ man@@ ders ; wa@@ agre@@ cht shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row , which is very good for the representation lateral on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the pin @-@ Mini@@ programme in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display in the size , display the windows as symbols or with their content and can move outside the control bar .
click on the right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and following selecting a switch set up ... leaves the dialog settings appear .
at the moment this may not be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do it manually :
open the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VI . if you do not want to register writing for the file , you need to register as a user root or contact your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ dered mode and assign value . possible values are :
since &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base is , you need a functional installation of the KDE @-@ basic packages .

&amp; likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on a weak machines .
when you play &amp; likes ; start a window like above . the main window of the screen is displayed . in the following , this window is displayed as a magn@@ i@@ fying window .. The picture that is displayed in the magn@@ i@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as selection window .

if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor is shown in the enlarged window , select the setting of mouse cursor . please note that the mouse @-@ cursor is currently not able to detect the form of mouse @-@ cursor . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor .
in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the mouse @-@ cursor in the magnific@@ ation window and keep the left mouse button down , so you can catch the contents of the magn@@ i@@ fier and move it also with the arrows .
if you add the &amp; Shift , button , or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window remains firm and only move the bottom right corner .

&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain using when clicking the mouse arises and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also prevent pain using your computer when using your computer , you should seek a doctor if this is not done yet .
to clarify it once again : even if &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain helps to avoid pain with clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the mouse because of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids is applicable : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse @-@ click as soon as you break the movement shortly .
if the intelligent shifts are activated , makes &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ back ; move the mouse , wa@@ its until the end of the motion , before the slogan will run the mouse button . in this way , you can run the goat with pressing mouse button . the smart moving requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly to it .
this we@@ dge period must remove after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; one mouse click away .
is smar@@ ter reloc@@ ating , the set field is moving ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time will be set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse button waiting , before it will release the mouse again , if there is no limit for the mouse at the time .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; now supports clicking on mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . this function creates a slow effect on the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the first time will be started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten your reaction time . open the &amp; col@@ l@@ center ; go to sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider gener@@ a . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting marks is marked , it will run &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . with G@@ NO@@ ME or other shut@@ downs , please drag the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically .
sets all settings to the values which were adjusted at opening the dialogue . have you already pushed the button on the button , the settings are set back to the last slide of application .
the best use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; initially with the preference . especially the smart moving you should be switched off at first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart moving .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; at sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect stays : clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in the browser window , which do not represent a link , will not lead to un@@ reported reactions . you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse jer@@ ck@@ elt , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take out the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . it should be clear however , if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and so@@ iling can be easily scr@@ ap@@ ed with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system breaks down the execution of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if you have just started a moving course . if you are using the smart moving tool , this means that &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by losing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you carry out a mouse @-@ click . thereby , the status of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; reset , and you can work as usual .
problem : if you input text , tries &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to a different location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor over there , where you want to have it . but you can &apos;t miss the mouse on a neutral area of work space when you &apos;re using a ke@@ ystro@@ phy . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the cover lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit it .
the smart moving is an advanced function of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ back ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , to add it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or run any other action , in which you want to move the mouse at impressive mouse button . but there will probably only be some advice . here are some advice on this :
use the smart moving tool if you are just starting to start &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; click on the one end of the text range a mouse click and keep the switching key pressed while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and again pressing the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse button ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when for intelligent moving the moving time starts . later you can use the smart moving even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should be the case on most of the system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and that is set up correctly .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button once the mouse @-@ cursor is short . this program was developed for people that suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and which the an@@ tigen of the mo@@ sta@@ sten pain is prepared .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button lo@@ osed in . in this way , the pulling and deriv@@ ative with the mouse can also be done .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which you can let your computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let the computer let the computer speak for yourself . the user can choose from a list of the talk of propositions that should be spoken again .
on the first page of the wiz@@ ard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) you enter the command which will later be used for the language output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup .
on the second page , select the standard text device . you can often choose text passages without having to type them in . the text passages can be processed naturally .
on the third page ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can reduce the list of words associated with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ ed words are included in the words of words .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your sentences ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a run @-@ mounted reservoir of the already mentioned sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have k@@ mouth ; properly inv@@ ent , you can enter the sentences in the input field , which you want to hear . each phrase sentence is attached to the reservoir . you can choose from these propositions which are to be discussed once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the page of words , and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the box language output , you enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field you set the strings defined , with the text to the language generator will be passed on .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the box if the text is to be forwarded as default to the language generator .
if the cross field is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ card :
of course , the command to voice output from your language generator is available . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with as soon as a voice service is used as a voice service , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ on @-@ language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; applications available for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down action following the selection of a text style , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cuts or through the choice of a text box in the text menu or in the bar for text @-@ books .
with the selection of instant , the chosen text is directly spoken and inserted in addition to the reservoir . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text was first entered into the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box of the editing pane for text @-@ book @-@ book , you can specify whether the word @-@ book @-@ book on the closing of the editing pane is to be saved automatically .
with the selection of text available book , the book is saved . if you choose any changes , the text device is not stored . select a check @-@ out , will &amp; k@@ mouth . ask if the text device is to be saved .
the page of vocabulary contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary field . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field you can currently select the dictionary for vocabulary .
with the buttons on the right side you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add or export the order of the books or export it to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is determined simply by ab@@ out@@ ward appearance . in addition , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to include only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can create the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they are supposed to be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered into the dictionary automatically , you will generate a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to handle text@@ books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a select entry . if you have selected a text @-@ mail , you can change the text concept or the corresponding short@@ cuts . if you have selected a text @-@ book , you can only change its name .
actions such as new text passages or books add or selected text passages or books you can either click on the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu .
you can change the sequence of text @-@ related text@@ books or text passages , by drag@@ ging the mouse to the new site or with the arrows and the old @-@ old ; -@@ button change .
the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry date .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ iry date .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ iry date .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shifts tool with buttons are arranged for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window , directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ded left side and draw the tool@@ bar to another passage can be moved .
if this menu is crossed , a narrow leaf in the lower part of the main window with references about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed , if not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is crossed , a shifts can be arranged for text pass@@ age@@ books with entries . the bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the sha@@ ded left side and draw the tool@@ bar to another passage can be moved .
probably you have the command for the language output not correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up the page of General Settings and enter the command for the voice output on the box language output . ( see the dialog dialog for language pres@@ izer for further details . )
festival is a language output system of the University Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ ch is supported . the license allows to use the festival for free and to re@@ distribute it without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a defined language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation language . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and dissemin@@ ated without restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . language output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be switched on to default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ ema in a Wave@@ file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA can be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax is happy to be the last sign of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . the full command is therefore la@@ vis@@ h than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sh@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data will be enabled as default .
the voice output of the dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; a further language service that is available for language output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
since the attitude of the language generator is done only in K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as as a language service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service that appears in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can not speak , text through the calcul@@ ator . it is saved a list of already saved propositions , which can be saved again and again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language pres@@ sible includes . on the computer a language pres@@ izer must be installed .

before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , you must install program on @-@ Disp@@ at@@ cher and stop correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are set up , the cart@@ on speaker will be shown . see also . if you have set at least a spokes@@ man , the cart@@ on board will be shown . see .
most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ izer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are different in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least set up a spokes@@ man before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use as the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker .
different speaker for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printing plates for the same printer .
if you click on the card &apos;s spokes@@ man in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the Kart@@ ei@@ card spokes@@ person is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ sm@@ itter and still no spokes@@ man is set up .
all already set @-@ up speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application does not give a spokes@@ man .
click with a mouse @-@ click a spokes@@ man from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ on board ;
select a voting type here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and girl@@ sa to choose from .
if you click here , appears on the new speaker on the Kart@@ ei@@ card spokes@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already nearly use . go back to the box office and verify that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; start . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text instructions . click on the cardboard card orders to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have set at least a spokes@@ man , you can start the language system from &amp; k@@ de ; start the card driver posted to open this box . here you can set some general options .
highlight this field in order to activate the &amp; kt@@ on ; this starts successful , the box tab is displayed , and you can create text orders and let you read text orders . see . remove the markings , will keep K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is finished , running &amp; kt@@ on ; further , provided that the field &apos;s language output is inserted ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this an@@ aesthe@@ tically marked and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears at the pre @-@ read automatically in the system field of control bar , it disappears again as soon as it is finished .
with the buttons in this series you can start text orders , stop and resume .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ cli@@ p@@ board read or read a text file . you can also change the speaker for an order .
click on the button or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all pages .
the card orders is only shown when K@@ TT@@ SD has been launched . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card holder in General and enable language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the requested page . check the text that should be read before , and select in the main menu tools text . after a short time the language output should start .
it &apos;s almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; most exciting lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read text before . check the text that should be read before , and select in the main menu tools text , then the language output should start .
this also works if &amp; K@@ ate is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ No@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; you will be notified of events by you . you can read the text of these messages also from &amp; kt@@ on .
in &amp; conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up that you will be notified if in an IR@@ C channel a message appears , in which your nickname occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C descend@@ ant text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ No@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the settings for K@@ noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filter for drawing chains is a good way to correct &amp; kt@@ ops . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml is a good example . you remove the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that k@@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box as this can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in fil@@ tering , text is dealt with , before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a matching language and spokes@@ person , or to deal with a certain lack of voice on@@ ers and their voices .
in order to understand the operation of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four types of texts .
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps these assignments . if the edition of the Screen reader is read , the orders received will be continued .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders are continued after the release of the warning .
messages have the n@@ igh@@ tly highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a website can be read , you can contact &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you encounter by the cardboard card is a text reservation . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text contracts are meant for the output of longer texts which have no special urgency .
all four order types are processed in queue , except the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just a reading , this issue will be stopped and termin@@ ated .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News .
filter for the text and pass it on to the next filters . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are run as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters .
strings can replace parts of a text by other text . the added parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; nbsp ; will be supplied with pre @-@ defined string E@@ moti@@ fs like : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Um@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included .
with intercom copies , you can submit orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text at &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text from KDE news about it . Sie@@ he@@ . read about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , after which he is applied to a voice output . if the filter notes that its rules may not apply , he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text application , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; sent message to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it through all activated filters that have been created on the page below . the processing is carried out in the sequence in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the comfortably normal filters . if a filter does not gau@@ ge , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will appear on the following sub@@ routines .
for setting up strings , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ ator patterns . will these patterns be found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . large and small case is not observed when compared .
if you choose a name for your filter , you can choose one . these names can be selected at any time , only by the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string &quot; string &quot; column . the list is being processed from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the marked word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file that list the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
is here a language registered , the filter will only apply if the spokes@@ person speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; key pressed .
if a value is entered , the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID run programs will be available with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ numbers you have to leave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID Cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 is shown , you can only enter copies .
the string ch@@ illing filter is only applied to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if match . all input fields empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
in comparison of words the character sha@@ fts filter cover regul@@ ars in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ating characters ( spaces ) .
in this hand@@ book you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can call it in the di@@ alogs to add or edit the help of these expressions . the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package indicated .
&amp; XML ; de@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to charitable XML . aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the speaker available , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card spokes@@ person , or to a spokes@@ person with certain characteristics . you can also specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . see .
before &amp; nbsp ; a text to the filter does not exist , it seeks a spokes@@ man for the text . the speaker is presented by the spokes@@ man properties that the program gives the text at &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the properties of the speaker available on the card spokes@@ person and speaker . with the speaker single filter you can re@@ write the chosen speaker .
if a value is entered , the filter is applied in case the text contains the regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; phrases installed , you can access this with one click on the button to get help with the input .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
insert the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the fil@@ tering conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements most likely . click the button on the right to view the dialogue process selection .
use these buttons to store or load your microphone settings or delete all settings .
the voting filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must register at least one condition .
the voice output API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with which language pres@@ izer will be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both APIs can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program c@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
here is the text of the text to read and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc .
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . start your box in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other .
none of the named langu@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Per@@ former@@ filter is set up , but when using the module for festival websites , web pages are not read .
due to an error at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . you need to do yourself if you do not use this voice to read Web sites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H is to be found .

the language pres@@ iz@@ ers who are used by &amp; kt@@ ts ; have their own license which you can find in the corresponding documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have an own license .
if you have access to the KDE source archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ts ; download from it . &amp; nbsp ; find the source code of k@@ de@@ filed under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and beer organic .
K@@ T@@ TS also works with every language pres@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be un@@ complete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages at rate . look at the website of kt@@ on ; for information that are not yet included in this hand@@ book .
the program &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ tive module architecture for lingu@@ is@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ on ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; however , it is not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or new ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you refer to the source code of &amp; kt@@ on ; from the source code archive , you have downloaded and downloaded all night at the moment , and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use first , whether speech Disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice output , you can use the shell script to use the shell script .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops . the program kt@@ in@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be further developed , that the setting up of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD conf is no longer needed .
a long text is dis@@ integr@@ ates into individual sentences . the user can re@@ vert stat@@ ute or ab@@ aster two , repeat the output or break down .
if an application text is attached to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , it can request the properties of the preferred intercom for the output . so if you have set a spokes@@ man whose language English and its sex is female , it will be automatically chosen the most suitable speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a spokes@@ man chooses to see you in .
if you click on the Kart@@ ei@@ card spokes@@ person to add or to edit a spokes@@ man on the list or on Edit , the card &apos;s spokes@@ person is displayed . as an example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . details on the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival .
select the character enco@@ ding for text which is handed over to the festival . in votes , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will automatically be made . generally speaking , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 use , eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you set up volume , intercom speed and audio @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice can not be chosen by you .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this approach , these voices are already loaded when starting from K@@ TT@@ SD , so that the first sentence is synthes@@ ized by the first set .
if this an@@ cruci@@ fied field cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a spokes@@ man ( or simply click on the application ) .
if this an@@ alog@@ ical box is selected , at the start of t@@ sm@@ itter the program window t@@ sm@@ itter is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this an@@ alog@@ ical field is marked and t@@ sm@@ itter is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to read or otherwise control it .
here are all orders listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of propositions and the currently working set . the speaker ID matches the column ID on the Kart@@ ei@@ card spokes@@ person .
with the kno@@ bs in this series you can claim sat@@ an in the order that is selected in the list below , prior to or returning . ( but not every order consists of multiple sets ) .
with one click on OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other card cards ) is taken over and t@@ sm@@ el@@ gr is set to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de , click on the box map audio . see also .
here are only text orders listed and managed . expenses of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio issue here . if a component cannot be selected , has been compiled &amp; kt@@ on ; either without support for the appropriate auditing , or &amp; kt@@ on ; the necessary libraries cannot load .
if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ co@@ de should be used for audio copy , select the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you have to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M device . see also
set the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ . % of the double normal intercom speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click on applic@@ ators to take the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ on ; system to take over .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out which device works with you . in doubt choose default .
on this card map you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text contract is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders :
the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps this orders . after the output of the Screen reader has been read , the orders received will be picked up again .
warnings have the n@@ igh@@ tly priority priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders will continue after the warning .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg ; just want to read a long text on a website , you can watch with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who comes straight to the room .
if a text is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen saver , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio issue is in queue .
this audio file is always played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound is performed before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card details apply only for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and expenses of screen readers , there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ on ; K@@ noti@@ fy messages can be read , run kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on aler@@ ts . the card &apos;s messages will be aler@@ ted .
mark this approach to switch to the pres@@ cri@@ b of &amp; che@@ de ; the settings are not marked , the rest of the settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads no noti@@ fications .
if this setting is marked , aler@@ ts , in which a sound is played , from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog appears , where you can choose the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentions your nickname in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which in the list is nothing else stated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this drop @-@ down to specify what to do , if an event meets . you have the following options :
if you have selected text @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder :
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker from which in the list on the card spokes@@ person is displayed as top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . is defined for a certain event of a particular application , it will run . otherwise , the action for all the other events of particular application is executed . as the last possibility , the action comes to wearing , which was specified under standard ( all other events ) .
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications how to follow :
use the button to store the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button store to store scann@@ ed settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Dele@@ te . all entries besides all handi@@ caps will be deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , the voice speed , the voice of the voice and the sound level . also brands for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation from for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ i@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ ph@@ onic voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for Speed or Ton@@ lage at the Festival @-@ Con@@ figuration dialog does not have 100 % ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ posi@@ tional flow filter ( SD@@ S filter ) . SB@@ Ds may start reading text into individual sentences . this can also be synthes@@ ized by the first phrase , not the entire text order . so you can also jump or jump back on the cardboard card orders or stopping , even if the language lear@@ izer does not directly support this directly .
here you see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up by typ@@ ing a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can change its settings or add more Stat@@ ues , beginn@@ er , but will be deduc@@ ted from it .
the easiest way to learn how to try and check the language selection . check out the box selection orders , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts . check out the box selection again , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed . of course , you need to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading more quickly since only the first set needs to be processed and not the entire text block that can last very long ,
you can keep text orders on the card &apos;s orders or break off , even if the language lear@@ izer , this function does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal proposition is automatically set up for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . change anything at this filter , unless you know what you are doing .
pro@@ posi@@ tional provisions compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulator mark ( tab@@ ular code 8 ) to the Stat@@ ues ( tab@@ ular code ) are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter is attached to the string .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ icking ) , warnings , news or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ sions .
if you have removed the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
on the card selection , you can write the intercom for the application . the box card will be shown if
use of the standard wiz@@ ard ( the top one on the card spokes@@ person ) . in other words , there are no microphone features defined .
use of the most modern speaker , which shows all the properties of a fully equipped speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from which the origin@@ ating characteristics originally corresponds .
select the method for entering the desired microphone properties by clicking on one of the selection kno@@ bs .
select the properties of the desired intercom . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything .
select this field if the property is to prevail over other features . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will be using this property rarely . the only case in which you possibly want to specify the attribute language , lies ahead if you know that a particular application text is sent in another language than the one described in the working environment .
to use all properties in the area of speaker , who is most likely to indicate the following link , click on the selection kno@@ b to use and then use spokes@@ man who is following the following .
in this case , 0 is available for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the entry 0 is required ) .
kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr cr@@ ashes down when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ on ; it was finished . probably you have to register G@@ ho@@ amer . at G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ stre@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ ho@@ amer or un@@ install .
the audio output about Al@@ sa does not work when I play music at the same time with another application music . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; a message appears : mean to open PC@@ M .
on your system the problem is that conflicts at Al@@ sa occur , which prevent a simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the web site of the Al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org website .
I have an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and can use it at the festival , but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / p / kt@@ ts@@ d / Di@@ ving . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the URL , where you found the voice to the developers .
on the Kart@@ ei@@ card audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H automatically . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer themselves on the cart@@ on card for intercom device , setting a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops . ( that is that the HTML in SS@@ ML will be converted . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ re@@ former@@ filter , and set the speech speed up .
I don &apos;t make it read that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . thus , the festival does not produce any errors , casts the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a private string but@@ t filter and now I can proceed to &amp; kt@@ on . on the cart@@ on orders is displayed , the order is only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , frac@@ tional signs , pun@@ ma and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter . use the filter for a filter for typ@@ ing detection .
al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; sound Architecture ) . al@@ sa is installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or newer . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ ho@@ amer by calling before the use of G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; the command G@@ ST @-@ Registry . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org )
some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio issue . if your system also includes , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and start reading a text . &amp; nbsp ; also free@@ zes out if you hold a text order and then start another . possible solutions to this problem you can find on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) .
in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text contract in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still being read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ on ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ pac@@ ed archive ) , register as regular user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball in a suitable folder . change to the folder and enter the following commands :

the following modules for lingu@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a run @-@ based dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to directives of the Debian distribution ) . the column configure option for shut@@ down of creation shows the configure parameter , which causes the passing of creation .
as default , your folder is installed in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you must specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = goal . for example
on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources .

before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use , check first if your language pres@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ izer whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices , you can set up volume , speech speed and sound level ; set .
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions provided with festival . would you like to read web pages , you must install the ( male UK ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing .
this voice consists of 1.@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Arabic / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you have to enter the votes ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ical ( 8 bit@@ rate ) coding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually contained in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions are available first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option must be enco@@ ding to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Syn@@ thes@@ izer will take over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio issue . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .

this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; one module for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Video Cloud center ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which allows the management of network interfaces , routine and DNA settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; col@@ l@@ actic center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; col@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; C@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; remote control center ; create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after installation a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the tool@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; will be started .
it is important to understand that &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , thus enabling &amp; net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and setting the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . network devices are added later , the driver must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel release :
the module network settings will be loaded when the option network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . in starting the module network settings this , the platform used to detect the system is automatically recognized .
if the platform cannot be detected , the sign@@ age range is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which of the distribution and releases are best suited . by flag@@ ging the setting non @-@ re @-@ ask the definition can be taken permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode . previously , all options are shown , which means that settings can only be viewed , changing settings is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can reach by clicking the button @-@ setting system administration mode at the lower end of the module . it is the input of the password required .
in the system administration , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders :
the rider network interface serves to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interface , the following tasks can be performed :
set up setting @-@ up networks can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button to set up the button in the dialog device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button below and displays the dialogue with continuing possibilities .
by selecting Autom@@ atically the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , TCP / IP @-@ settings are required for each system start , so no further adjustment will be required . in the selection list can be either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system selected .
with the selection manual it can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the input field IP address , the required TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask is the sub@@ system @-@ mask set .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface with the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values involved in this dialog are shown as characteristics of the device in the device .
it should be assured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can determine if the requested address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switch @-@ on @-@ device @-@ device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
network devices can be activated , enabled , or switched off , depending on the need . switch off of a activated network can be accessed by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks .
when the computer is present more than a network interface , the interface must be chosen to the network in which the gateway computer is selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete cross @-@ address given by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers only asks IP addresses : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS trig@@ gers this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer for the attri@@ bution part of the rider naming is possible to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed , or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through the selection of a tra@@ der and exec@@ uting or her@@ al@@ ted in the list with the buttons , or to be arranged in the priority .
by clicking the button you can add ... from the group to add a DNS server , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button &quot; Add . the entry is then included in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the group machine to track record , select an entry and then click on the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit ... It will display dialog editing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of specifically known computers describes billing address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used by boats if no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
normally the list of particular calcul@@ ators contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses assist . this is still in the test @-@ being version of IP should replace the version 4 in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known machine and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the known machine and clicking the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; if the well @-@ known machine has several ali@@ ases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button to add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select an entry of any named machines from the list and select Edit ... The dialog of acquain@@ tan@@ ces will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will be updated the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be deduc@@ ted .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graph@@ ically surface like k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed .
this is only recommended for experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology is given , in the second all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; alter@@ able configuration files are discussed .
this section can not replace knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on the integration of the PC is conve@@ yed in a small ( home ) network .
currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected that in the near future , this description is concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the operator , which is a valid IP address , or if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address may not be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by hiring a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses are used in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers .
additionally , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are on the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = of your own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP development .
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part you are the configuration files which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in different distri@@ butions .
this file sometimes is dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than set there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is cas@@ c@@ apped by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; soldier ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . the first goal was to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which presented the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective extracts . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer takes it when you secur@@ es ?
before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can happen in three ways :
&amp; soldier : sp@@ ult the band back and reads the pre @-@ tension information of the bank . realize &amp; soldier on the tape not , you will be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
dete@@ cts and kiss ; the pro@@ sp@@ ar , it searches for the matching index on your disk . can not be found , you will be asked if the band index is to be created anew .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol of the band &apos;s work is changing to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the belt can now be searched through out the application for the band .
prior to the throw of the bank , initially the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
there is a change of symbol for the band by changing the symbol for the band that incorpor@@ ates the integration of the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without danger .
before a band of &amp; soldier may be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; soldier ; format@@ ted .
a band species must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process corresponds not to the format@@ ting at &amp; kiss ; does it happen before you use the tape of &amp; kiss ; format@@ ted usually a format@@ ting of the bank @-@ ahead , DAT drives however not .
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; kiss ; with the format@@ ting of the bank . all the data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you must select the files to secure files . that can happen in three ways :
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . only this file or the folder is secured .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sich@@ uan ...
once the backup was initiated , dialogue will open up settings for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to secure the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
select a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a box . only the marked files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry . ....
once the test process has been started , the dialog settings for veri@@ fying . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the folder for the review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you confirm the settings for verification , the dialogue will appear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before you can manage the re @-@ establish , the files must be recovered , marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or a folder in one of the archives that belong to the band &apos;s drive . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folders .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are recovered .
right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ....
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the folder for recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you confirm the settings for restoration , the dialog appears re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the creation process as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file by the band@@ content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
here you will create a backup profile with the exactly marked files and the default settings . you can make your backup profile the following settings :
the current work folder , in which the backup should be carried out . the list of data files will be automatically updated according to the chosen work folder .
for all folders , which are listed under backup files , is that only the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are on other fil@@ esystem , you can list separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others .
perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files are guaranteed that have changed since then .
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file against the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons are p@@ itted ; and lt ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings allows you to set up the menu item in the menu settings ... in the menu settings . the following settings can be made :
the full path to the device file for the band@@ drive ( normally / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recurring version of the band .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be transferred to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or ty@@ pe@@ work can be performed .
is the option turned on , tries &amp; kiss ; to block the throw at the band@@ drive . possibly this setting does not work with all band &apos;s drive .
if the option is switched , when solving the integration of &amp; soldier ; automatically the tape is dis@@ car@@ ded . use this option not at flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; kiss ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ves block size for the band@@ drive . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; kiss ; in any case , block size for your band &apos;s drive .
when &amp; soldier is format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the bank . this file should only occupy a storage block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band @-@ ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ able : seconds , making calcul@@ ator the full name of the system in which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU / - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental securities .
check the contents of a backup club . this symbol is only active if a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystems log ; the program is suitable for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where to receive information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; experienced users access the quick access for example on issues related to their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystems log ; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , which do not know where to get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ haf@@ log ; experienced users access quick access for example on issues related to their server . &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; therefore , tries to provide some advanced functions with whose help the protocol files of certain programs may be fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; a number of useful features . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this hand@@ book .
as you see in the following scre@@ enshot , &amp; ks@@ haf@@ log ; functions available , with whose help the individual protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sort out . the individual options for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book .
after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; initially the most important protocol @-@ file of the system - the system protocol is opened - you will not open up instead of using a small news window , so you have a mouse @-@ system log ; very likely not with system administration right . the protocol files usually find themselves in the folder / var / log , for the normal users usually don &apos;t have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criter@@ ion . the list of the log lines is now automatically changed , so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter all . then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string string of the filter search is included .
you can also choose another entry at this point . select the string &quot; string &quot; string , and enter the name of a process , and carry out the name of a process so shows you &amp; ks@@ ystems log ; all protocol lines sent to which process have been sent or created .
this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol @-@ lines of a stage critic . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off @-@ setting dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can look at the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you will use filter bar .
furthermore , you can switch the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystems log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up additional sub@@ window and manage . once you have chosen a sub@@ window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ ystems log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more current information on the supply sources of &amp; ks@@ ystems log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystems log ; also take a look at the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archiving : ks@@ ystems log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is rapidly developing the standard for control of the system starts at the high level of the system in the &amp; Linux ; this is because it is easier to use , powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
the In@@ it bin@@ ar file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without having a re@@ installation and new format . therefore you have to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD in@@ it that configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the peak of the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ ters that only once started . such calls are after r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand at / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file , even if there is actually not much used to do this . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit of what to do with the serial port .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first that he finds .
the standard Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see in the beginning a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the presented Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can proceed with the in@@ it@@ tab changes . if you still have a bit of it , then come repair by restart the system and perform the following :
but how does it now start all the right scripts ? if you enter &apos;s -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stops in@@ it actually System@@ services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written that it is a argument as start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts actually from hand on the command line :
this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d servers . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains , the script will be called with the argument . if he contains a S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry in the range of Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . thereby , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they pick an entry from the range of Av@@ ail@@ able system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy it to a new Run@@ level , you must select from the Edit menu or select from the context menu and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries which have been thrown into the trash . be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the different working areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired running level with inser@@ ting ( using C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to manually change the sorting number or the name of an item manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by re @-@ pressing the entry button to accept the changes , or push Es@@ c to dis@@ miss the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if they are available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . if changes to pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have cem@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n her@@ u@@ Mexican and now the machine starts re @-@ resistant . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have made some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way , as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately the configuration for the proprietary layout programs of this distri@@ butions , however , does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the programme for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all the configuration files are available ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply complete without message if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added .
this documentation refers to &amp; user user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user .
once you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu .
&amp; user user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cart@@ on cards , user interface and user list . to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties .
some card cards are only represented when you have expanded system preferences . only if you have space requirements ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a box card will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards may appear if the shadow - passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ uniform are installed .
the card administration appears , if the shadow - passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ uniform are installed .
this card details appear only to be activated and initi@@ alizing ( Qu@@ ota ) and initi@@ alizing ( recognizable by the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here you can modify parameters for each user , where the space restrictions are stored in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space constra@@ int .
the cart@@ on card groups informs about the group members of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field primary group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by highlight them in the big field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or the selected group is an@@ alogue .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO Boot@@ Manager , remove the boat password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , change and more .
