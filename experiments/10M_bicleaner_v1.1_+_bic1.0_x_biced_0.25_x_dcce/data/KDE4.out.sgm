<seg id="1">You can translate the module website in the & Konqueror; menu under extras. select from the selected list the output and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated from the whole & URL;</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a crude translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not depend on important decisions without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the babyfish page, where you can insert text-in texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package includes various modules for & Konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & Konqueror; by making this easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & Konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual too & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & Konqueror; invite settings to set up settings.... Open the box toolkit and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of default modules dating from the package kde; add-ons. please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the package base, the & Konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & Konqueror; on extras. then you can view the page, the & Konqueror; the crash, or the list of storks, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module's pagefilter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & Konqueror; menu bar under exchanging filters. with the module you can filter & Konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree in & Konqueror; use the DOM tree to display... and thus open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the ad starts with the root notes of the document, example: the element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root canal.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & Konqueror; represents another view of objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory with local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different tool- and text views to view the content of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of portrayed folder-hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree map. each object is displayed by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must own the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size of a folder reflects the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected in the folder of the folder. accordingly, & FSView can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the podium representation a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and descriptive settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched on color mode can either be depth for the slight detection of the tightening surface or the illustration of a different file, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property you can determine if enough space to display or whether the surface of subordinate calculations is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the labeling in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Daring algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the item. at the podium in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained to represent the tighter of entries, and this frame may need space, which is then lost the subordinate entries. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle square is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an entry for subordinate entries remains the implementation shall be left. here it is for the ripping and avoiding placements by frame always beneficial the surfaces such as square-thickness, which are as square-shaped. the best methods for this are lines, columns or recursive second hastily.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum surface area for an entry on the menu view. instead, a smokpattern is drawn into the area of the higher order entry to indicate that this area is actually being occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Treemap widgets, which was developed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & Konqueror; menu under extras: create... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you access the module picture, there will be a dialogue with which you can set the appearance of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option tracks of the page allows you to adjust in a text box the title of the picture gallery page.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a set box to adjust the number of thumbnails each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the crossbox subfolder you can switch to a slider or a set, up to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">With the titular original pictures, please specify whether the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">In the commentary box, you can use a commentary file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the Ancrucified shades, you can specify a different color picture for the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings offers you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & Konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & Konqueror; menu under extras settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>

<seg id="39">To play, click on the navigation area of the & Konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Browsing detection adds a menu entry in & Konqueror; added, by which you can change the browser and operating system detection for individual domains. this is useful for web sites that allow access to only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The standard browser detection of the & Konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (ID; Conqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you are entering a website that has been denied access with this browser, change the browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changing the identifier in MSIE for Pages, which refuse access with browsers based on Mozilla. you need for example the MSIE browser detection to call with the & Konqueror; hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages which do not match the W3C standard or use its own & HTML; - elements and attributes, are shown correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">This option is used to use browser detection for all pages of the site you are visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the amount of information about the used browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>

<seg id="55">A simple to use camera point will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & Image. more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader is supported, supported by your operating system, with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicame; contains a fast image processing with basic training tools. you can use them to comment and correct your photos. the editing skills can be easily expanded with KDE image plug-ins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitised; easy to use, it makes use of professional skills at your disposal. it works completely in the 16-bit colouring and all available modules support the pipe convergence by libraw, DNG-Export and ICC Manager.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; about the camera or the lens, about which can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs is also & digitised; an open source project. that means it's dependent on supporting the end users. you should therefore report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digitised; tries to make milking of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you use this shortlist, your web browser opens a page in the fault system. all required information is already registered here. follow the instructions to send your account.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digicame; is a project that is supported by a community. i.e., the user and developers came to each other. if you have a regular user of & digitised, then we would like to answer any other users of & digitised. however, in this mailing list, however, you should be English speaking, you should be powerful this language therefore.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitization; homepage to visit news about free versions and other information about & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved & digitized is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in the developer mailing list of & digicame;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you run & digitised, for the first time, you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database. just enter a local, remote or remote folder, simply enter the folder name or click the folder symbol to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second box you need to specify a local folder on your computer. this path is stored for all the image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add a lot of folder as you would like to add. & digicame; will you additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam set up collections.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder, the images, as a base folder. & digitised, each subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. during the search of the folder you will get a progressively showing how to see them:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitised; dures recursively the librarian in its entire depth. you can not expel any subfolders, unless it came in a stemmed folder. this allows you to insert a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">When you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albends have no photos as symbols. you can change the edit photo from the album and take it on the folder symbol. this will then be used as a symbol symbol. further details please find in the section albums.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you configure the base subfolder you can set up & digitization. after that, you should learn how to use My albums and My keynote list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: in case you use the shell mode of your camera, so it may also handle. the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu Help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How you set up this and working with raw files is described in the sections of Roh Decodersettings and roh operations.</seg>
<seg id="73">A simple to use camera point will be made available to you with your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & Image. more than 1000 digital cameras will be supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader is supported, supported by your operating system, with & digitised.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterised by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera will then be implemented as a disk drive. the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may take advantage of the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& digitised; use the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital cameras, which is an ever-increasing number of more than 800 cameras supported. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a common protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmission across the serial port is slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicame; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found at this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must be created with libexif support is required to read the thumbnails of digitization. if the EXIF support is not available in libgale 2, you might not be able to think about anything or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digicame; is how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI module: the KDE image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for & digitised; to create the Photoalbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide modules with all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as it can also be a user. your advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitised; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digicame; even carry out.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the page with & LMB; remove or switch to full-screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">The drag and drop of images works everywhere: you can take a picture in another part of the alp, above the horizontal separation line or another application window. the only restriction is that a picture does not appear in keywords, date list or searching.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a filenary selector allows you to lift the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that appear in the toolview. thus, the filtering is displayed on the filename only if this ind the symbol symbolises. which fields are shown you can configure in the dialog of alchemist.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photobox. all photos taken by & digitised, in which they were stored on the hard disk, according to the name of their collection in the Albenproperties or after the date when the album was first created, sorted by the album first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan a screen shot directly to an album. choose an album Imported screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moving through moving or copying. simply select all pictures and move them onto the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features to give you information about this collection. to access the Albumproperties, you have to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit it in the context menu of Albumproperties.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to highlight your albums so that you can choose from a common name for sorting out your photos, when you select from the toolbar or select View Samples collection. if you add new collections or want to delete, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons, average, newest: these set the date on the one's oldest, the latest image or the average of the album. first, first attempts to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digitised, the first image is chosen as a symbol for the & quot; my Albenlistequot; selected. this will help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button, and in the context menu & quot; As you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections can not be wasted.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitised; supports input of keywords for individual photos in the area my keyword list left down in the main window. album collections have another effect. the collection includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The window window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo will display in a preview, you can watch the size of this preview with the two loupe ball in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">If you open an album for the first time, you must wait short while the thumbnails will be generated. this can be avoided in which you can regenerate the thumbnails in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each picture is shown below the associated preview. what information these are, you can change about settings digitised; setup here the albums page and adjust the area thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows, the ads. if you leave the mouse-cursor a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot of the top in the section introduction into the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about what it came at & digitised. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. you can reach all the features that come with & digitised. you can reach all the functions which are available with & digitised. you can choose between watching the images, a diaschau or the editing of images.</seg>

<seg id="103">You should note that after the processing of other image processing programs, you should keep problems with the metadata working in the picture. some programs do not store this data with when you save the modified image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, blending, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicame; provides two possibilities for rotation. the easiest way is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select rotating. in the submenu, you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the filenames of a photo, you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. please note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you have a photo of & digitised; extinguish it will be moved in the dustbin of & kde; if you prefer to deleting, you can do it by using Shift; withdrawf.</seg>
<seg id="107">The view & quot; My Dataloglistequot; organizes your photos based on the data. & digitised; used either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">When you choose one month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks at the date sheet in the date view, so that you can only show the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provides a flexible and powerful way to organize your photos and catalogue. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos, which were marked with this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. here, you can organize your keywords logically. you can also share parts of the building & quot; My keyword quot;) together, so that you can find the keywords which you're looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and weighted keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs. besides, the keywords in case of loss of the database re-imported, once & digitised; the images have noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button either on & quot; my Stichting quot; or to an existing keyword click. if you add a new keyword after you clicked on an existing folder, it becomes the word-word of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data on data. metadata are provided in accordance with your definition of data, which will provide information about or manage the documentation provided by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you don't even know how many photos you have, then you will certainly not use & digitised.. the approach to store the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast seeking and secure archiving that you can access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and know before doing something in your system is building up information structure in contrast to data structure. you have to decide whether other access to your photos may want to save on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. notice that you will eventually need to switch to a larger drive.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location. if you were able to use enough pictures, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. then export is a folder for images you want to print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as locking the photos, archiving, working courses, constant intake of images on different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years 95% Archive and 5% working files will not be able to organise your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes stacking processing easier. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and workfiles makes a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to store Metadata in the settings of the metadata in & digitised. this ensures that exif- and IPTC data will be written into the file. if you forget this, then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens when you want to change what's going to change? then a metadata editor will provide them for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now select any photo keywords, descriptions and an evaluation. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then put the value then. you start with the rating or the ranking. this makes sense because you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now let us know the keywords, keywords as you are frequently called on other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then a problem and can simply insert the tree in the right place. the change of hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving a subtree to another. the changed keywords are being updated by & digitised, while the subtrees are persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphics show like different metadata, cut off. this is a very rough representation, as every block of metadata in truth consists of many sections. filenames and calendar dates properties of all pictures.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to labeling or comments, the third important tool to catalogue your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You just want to see most of your photos just plain, you want to share it with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you are certainly interested in keeping your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this der Landeplatz of Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing is. wow! you start to dream, associations, the historical time period is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the signment has completely changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos is the title possibly more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember that the key is the importance to the viewer to help Him over the motif you have moved to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is ok if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only to act with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitised, you can use as much text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), as labeling, you can even export a spellchecker. if you export your pictures into web galleries, then these signments will be exported to your wishes in the labeling and / or the title of the web galactic system. so you have to tell the story for the opening session.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now starts with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities that the geolocation can take advantage are already countless and will be able to open in the future with geographical indications. & digitised, then you can also export cml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the googleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word play with copyright and refers to the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the layout page of & digicame; as information should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should add your name, or the name of the person that has created the photo. for example, the name of a company or organization can be used, for example, the name of a company or organization can be used. once again, this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Authoristitle (synonym for author's header): associated with the author. examples may be title such as: Anders photographer, freelance photographer or Independent commercial photographer. since this is a note to the author's author, this field must be filled just as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider to identify who has to offer the photo. if the photographer is working for a message agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here. if the image is a stock photo, then the group / Agency will offer the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is important to fill the author and copyright paragraphs. each of which has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers may delete or change. the solution to this problem are digital watermarks. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitised; will provide such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: record errors, disk breakdown, ECC, transmission defect, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster, temperature, data size, widespread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire. this kind of loss are the same which can also happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it is about problems with the so called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the biggest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, you need to be treated more careful and you may not last longer than a couple of years. of course, you can also store CDs and DVDs into archives. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & Dollar; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe this is in your immeasurable room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable but you can use this risk in which you are using good discs and good recording equipment. the best DVD shooting devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable. so it turns the right choice.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to fault, even if you have just written it. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and the control environment. despite this massive protection they require by chemical aging, Ultrachroolettes light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called isobuster which apparently causes wonder at CDs and DVDs. it works under Windows and & Linux; it is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged disks, hard drives, flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs appear to save the Formatwar against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost sixty times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs, of course also for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording of high quality media in a not propriated format. read then the data again with a description, date & author passwords and afterwards to a clean, dark dry and above animals protected place. do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read the media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discotheters retain your statistics for itself. your manufacturer's circular cover a new disk, but not the data. Google presents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives: floppy study</seg>
<seg id="187">Shortly: Disks keep on the longest when you are operated in the temperament of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. electronic parts of Controllers are increasing the most common error. some of SMART errors announce the immediate expiration. these are especially readers and publishers. the expected lifetime period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is just the complete loss of loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to an electricity failure before you have backed up the files, but these losses can normally restore without big problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices don't account much, that can take heavy damage when devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause severe damage. on your computer these anomalies can cause pertinted keyboards, complete data loss, hardware replacement, destructive motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the inavoids that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against electricity tips is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbed a part of energy-heat and the rest is flown. it is usually available in the form of a stand-bar. but remember that not every Steckerbar contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to the protection against lightning bolt and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage each cable can use to your computer, you should be sure that also all peripherals are connected to your system. this also applies to telephone lines and wire modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage mentee that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have an emergency, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore contain very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for the road.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system will protect your system before smaller fluctuations in the electricity lines, it will help you with a complete failure. even an expiry of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful in investing free power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Apart from the protection against overtension, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a blackout occurs. some models allow them to even continue to work until the stream is running. if you purchase a USV then you should be sure that they are filled the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Concerns the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and compare its security in electricity problems with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can you get up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference when you consider it's just a small price difference when you consider it's just a small price difference. to conclude, you should always think all the cables to separate before you go to the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use this as a backup goal for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that you can store any amounts of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are in comparison with the hard drives, but very expensive - 40 GB costs & Dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online. the professional version provides you more, in case of Flickr dramatically more. for 25 $per year you get unrestricted memory, which should be checked only in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web-solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically added thanks to the TCP protocol and in the big companies it is included in the offer a backup and a partial memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs face at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive safely.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that nobody says when a transmission defect has occurred until you open a photo to one day and this to your surprise is destroyed. no one seems to have thought of it in your computer. no one seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission loss as they create interference within data streams. in normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two Candidates available on a low level and can be scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one to the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is soon also available for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs system system. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that are used and is available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the core.</seg>
<seg id="208">Underestimate this not! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% in workplace-operating systems. for notebooks, the percentage of the theft of 50% is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the most people think. it leads to a lower damage than theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than EXT3, routing, JFS and XFS to name the common file systems. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corroborated data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem appeared, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this advancement. sensitivity and smoking characteristic for all kinds of lighting sensors are no longer far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today cameras go towards the 10 megapixelsensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and high quality optics are the Optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their border with 10-12 megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">So you get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro. so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. so, you can find your data often according to a plan and test this backup before you do anything as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of plates, or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes, you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests locally and destroys a lot. forget aircraft gap: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they normally affect an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desires does not always mean a local storage. bring your backups up the staircase, into the neighboring building, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite safeguarding the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy of a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the full backup and the last differentials.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. produces several times. you can restore the original status at any time to which a backup was made. this backup comes up to a versioning system next with the exception that it is only sealed and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. in contrast to script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmission files copies rsync only the difference of files that really have been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security about ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Secure important images directly after you have stored them on your computer to DVD or another optic medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore. at the same time you come up for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the workfiles. in the end you have done a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month. each additional thinner should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, affiliated XMP files, original, storage, scalability, media, relocate images and metadata, copy images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">To make valuable images the next 40 year, that is about the time period in which you really are interested in helping you remember your childhood and youth, there are two strategies that should be observed:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future due to your nature is unpredictable, you need to look at everything today. unfortunately, there is no other option to be compatible with caution. all 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards. the less variants you have used in the past, the more easily it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures, then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and safety technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the professional pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means to enlarge.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you plan the scalability with plans and the area they want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg, if your new record was detected by the system, but do not hang them one.</seg>
<seg id="235">S / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the record in MBs; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and removable & Dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of removable if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary, patented format that disappears slowly from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was developed as an open source standard developed by GIF. however, it is possible to save XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF needs and slow compression. this format we would like to recommend you to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a loss-free compression salt (deflate). a problem is however that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera controllers is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it at some time.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology; a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF; it is a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored by the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to be a original shot of your recording, mostly in the raw format, to archived. XMP adds up to problems when linking between the metatendatei and the image file, and as it can be noted above, you should think if you use DNG as containers and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organisation supporting for fully compatible online metadata management, working in a wide range of applications and modelling, discussions and joint work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI labour groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightened efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camedium, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine-layered processing you can use external programs. if you have the pictures again with & digitised, then you should add the metadata again. these have circumstances be cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Use the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to Webgalerien, coded in MPEG, use in contact blades, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digitised. in the section we add photos to an album you can add a description, you can add to your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digitized; connect them with the computer, turn the camera onto the display mode, and turn it up. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a heel indicator at the bottom end and the thumbnails will be displayed on the camera. some cameras do not show thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file files displayed for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information about each entry. with the margins properties and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an item or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photographic information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras are not available for all information.</seg>
<seg id="253">The rider Metadata shows the internal metadata such as EXIF, manufacturing, GPS etc. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar on the main window of & digitised; or the image processing. note that these metadata are not available with some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera into a single album in & digitised. when downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired setting methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button download and then download unchosen. the chosen button download is long as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New download is available. these images have not yet been downloaded from & digitised. in this case, the new pictures with a star in the thumbnail marks. if you choose this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you can download or download the buttons, a dialog with which you can select the target album, displayed in which the photos are stored. the list of the existing albums will be displayed, such as regular folder, you can read in the section My albums. then select the target album out of the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and & digitised; invites the photos of the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once by using the button Delete All delete. if you only want to delete a few, you must select this first and then delete erasing.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there is no possibility to restore photos from the camera to restore. so, the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & kde; if you want to completely delete them from the camera; if you want to completely delete it from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera store, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as filenames for the photos often not particularly expressive name. this can result in double filenames in case you load photos of different steps in the same album. therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirror-based sub-based sub-color. if you use this last option, automatically a folder per day is created.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transmission opens three more options which are done before the photos on the record are stored. the first two concern the data on the author in the section standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use another date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo -% Y-%% H:% M:% S:% S:% S. place the option date & time out. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file, you have the option to change the filename in small letters. or in major case if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitised; for a photo is used, the camera will be displayed in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and automatically used when you open the next time the camera.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digitised; may use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time of recording, to carry out an automatic rotate during downloading. not all cameras provide this information. in section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera did not supply this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want to switch off the automatic rotation, use the button Advanced and select the Automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera records information about the date on which the photo was made available, the photo can be loaded onto the image album. all images with the same date will be loaded onto the same sub-album. all images with the same date will be placed in the same sub-album. you can read all the cameras with the same date. in the section sidebar Meta-data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in this case stores & digitised; the photos directly in the destination album. if you want to change this, you have to turn this option. use the button Expanded at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos of their computer to your camera is the button download. then select a upload. the file optionally dialog & kde; appears in which you can select the files which are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods select.</seg>

<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general concept in this document. it is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude, which can be displayed on a map. identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographer, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to cartography an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planer, military, police, architecture offices and property agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was made, you can access a browser which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digitised; users want to send the location of photographs, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the positional data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first, you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as the direction, Sattelites and cardboards are supported. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-editing of GPS data and images files using the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last via manual input of well-known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera, which has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS recipients. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store this data in the gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the module for the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS which can extract data from images and from GPS. on the following page you can set the same under & Linux; add: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script that works with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the sign-like coordinates that are created for example by maps.google.</seg>

<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IPTC data fields, if the option is selected for downloading from the camera point. also in database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authoristitle is a synonym for the author: this field should be the professional name of the photographer. these can be designations like e.g. Anders photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the author, this field must also be filled.</seg>

<seg id="295">Over- and subordinate areas of an image can be marked with darker or brighter colour in the picture. these colors will be defined here. in picture editing, this observation mode can be installed with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the immediate explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the setting PNG compressing you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality, as PNG used a loss-free algorithm. the only effect is that the images required more time for training and packing. if you have a quick computer, you can set this value to high compression. thereby means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files, you can switch the deflate salgums for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the Deflate algorithm is loss of loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can save losses off. even if you choose the loss of loss, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata were not yet supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digitised, the image processing was just an imaging rate for photos. currently, it quickly developed into a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default output is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixel of the CCD sensor is responding as the pixels with odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option draws the image a little soft, eliminates the 2x2 Gitterpattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">When this option is set, the white slipping from the camera will be used. otherwise, if set, the automatic colour balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white is unmatched. standard is it a fixed color balance sheet, which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that subordinate images in four steps get more details in the shutter. for other cameras, this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shutter, so the parts of your images are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to capture the shutter. use the setting up in different rockets. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red proportions of the yet saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a matter how much colour or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you choose the option reconstruct the option you get the possibility to set a level. here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each picture individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminate value to your taste. you probably have to put it higher than the standard 1. however, this can also later be done in the image options of the & digipack. in order to keep the time for the demoosaicing, you should proceed more conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to extract a complete image from the subfiltered image, which provides many cameras and which is known as a matrix colour pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or colour design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicame; and Dcraw represent you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (for adaptive homogeneity) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it also produces colouring at the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with a acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue-corrective values here. this is certainly the best method for a color correction, since you will be converted during the use.</seg>

<seg id="317">The input profiles should customize you. not all profiles are created for the same type. there are some, such as Canon, which do not have any color mapping or gamma correct. currently, dcraw Gamma does not have to do for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to perform the colouring mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft Proof profile that you can emulate as your image would be given back to a device. this is very useful before you print the image as your camera and some colors therefore have very saturated. this could manually correct you instead of leaving on the flashing algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon camera expansion leaves the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; images and image processing. by providing this interface can & digitised; many modules support that were written to cooperate with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI module, you can see a list of available modules. select the one you want to use and these are then loaded by & digitised. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the curtains.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short-command for tasks which can be done by modules, can set in the menu under settings short instructions.</seg>

<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can put the path for USB- and FireWire- (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage box. you have to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / regenerate, on which you attach your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & Image, you must connect the camera to your computer, put them into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & digitised; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera odell and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will display in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>

<seg id="338">The image processing contains a range of tools to improve your pictures. some of them are available as modules in & digitised. so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you can find in the section picture processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current data number, magnification factor and the current size picture shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top of the edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, the original photo will change the original photo before you used file saving or the button save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should make sure to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can save you with file save.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you don't have stored the photo, you can restore the original image by using the File Restoration button or use the button reproducing the image processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change that you have performed in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or recovered. the last action can be reversed by selecting editing sway or restored by selecting editing reset from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should remember the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for the backway and make Ctrl; -envelope-Z to re-establish.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you choose the & LMB; over the back-up or re-making button in the toolbar a moment longer press, get a text menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also reversed or recovered.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation button in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have any changes in the current photo you are asked if you want to store them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can start in the photo and out of zooming in which you are using Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the toolbar menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: magnification factor automatically select</seg>
<seg id="350">View full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. they come into the normal view in which you use the Esc button. usually, you can change this in the setting dialog of & digitised. you can change this from the & Image window. see this section for setting up the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the menu file and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or entire sentences. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the menu album Exportioners. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digitised; main window has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions available for the selected images. the same page bar is available, even in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders are clicked on:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the descriptional view, you can input holes with unlimited size or insert. please note the text below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. that means all special characters are permitted in the EXIF- and IPTC- fields to allow you to be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments will be cut off after 2000 characters and are shaped. if you want to use the IPTC marking field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, you can either use the button or simply switch to the next picture, the signments will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the Appendix button, there is a button More. with this you can write more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this will always be performed if you have chosen a metadata adjustment which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searching and sorting line. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut. to evaluate several images simultaneously, select this out and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The review is written in the IPTC field. the encoding follows the schema in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords review shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keywords, and a selection box with the previously shown in this &... session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will be dynamically adjusted to the search word. you can quickly restrict the number of possibilities in search of a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief in entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords may also be set by flagging of the relevant proportions in the tree. all the keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC-field Keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view, and you will select a keyword in the keywords, this will only be applied to the highlighted picture and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keynote filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - Datum-, keyword and search views. if in addition, one or more keywords will be used on the right, only the intersection of these two are displayed. all submerged keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and discard it. suppose you have selected multiple images to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and place a dialog, which you asks if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keywords will be reduced to three pictures. they were drawn up with Ctrl + a and then a keyword was drawn from the right twore tree to the choice and asks you. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes will take place at every start of the program. it can also be switched on under settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that there is one or be, you can easily change this with a double-click on the text and control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry, after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or a string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify a detailed search of all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need the crossroad at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then see how follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed there? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why one is using a colored workflow, this is the colours used by your camera or scanner to have a predictable deviation from the actually photographic and scanned colors. with a colored workflow, you can achieve that the colors can be printed on your monitor from your camera or scanner and that the colours you want to print or publish in the web, publish of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic is coming to colour management, everyone wants to know which buttons, he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you can inform you sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you will find links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image meets all of the criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You will be working on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB-colour space. (further information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other image documents are via email or the web where sRGB of de facto standard is standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and making life for all so easy, why should one then use another color-space and therefore have thoughts about colouring managers?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of Limitation of sRGB compared to the colors that we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the huseshoe region, and the colors in the sRGB of colour space, triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensionals representation of sRGB with some larger farms, so visit Bruce Lindbloom excellente site and click on info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to cold my monitor if I decided to work only in the sRGB Farms?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB bulls or not, you must escalate your monitor now, because sRGB exceeds your monitor. the callibriation of your monitor has so close the circle. if you work as in the colour space of sRGB, you must use either your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections available, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore use it before you try a further manual machining.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize the same, automatic deductions and contrast expand from the menu corrigidity automatic correction automatically try to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method escalates the luminosity values over the whole image, so the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible will change without its color shading. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method jushed the luminosity factor of the colours of the selected image, so that the histogram of the Intensity Canal is as shallow as possible. this makes the same very good results in improving the contraction of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish. it is a very powerful surgery that causes either wonders in one image or destroyed it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic shutdown: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green- and blue channel. they determines the dark and bright frontier and jushes the red, green- and blue channels on the entire Histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast expand: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible area and a reboiling of all values in between. this is only visible when watching images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white-off of & digicame; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-like of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-like correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per colour. in case you are able to perform too far from the original image in the raw mode, which works in the 16-bit mode, so your possibilities for correction are better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-like salinity that is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it over the menu entry colors white like the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The thumbnail can be adjusted in size. on the left are both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamic as the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white comparison, then it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photos has a red markers. the Luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above will be shown a Histogram so as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful as soon as you have a parameter. this histogram has been very helpful even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminaire. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, satiation and gamma. the shade will be able to enhance the shadow details of your photos or play off.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls are playing, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture show to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overload indikator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixel. you will get the combined result in the white point. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons Save as well as loading exactly this. every adjustment of the white balance sheet you can put in a text file and then load them again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button presets sets all filtering values again on its default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image is changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code samples per color channel of the edited image. 8-bit coction is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit cocoding is better for high quality images. this coding needs also more disk space, calculating time and stands for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw materials. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles. color mapping can be carried out by the subwindow for the use of colour profiles. a detailed guide to the use of colour profiles can be taken to the section color administration.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors sound correction. this tool allows you to use your settings at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always make the same mistakes and you therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for the sound correction you will find further information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful opportunity to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you will find under colours gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised; tool labeling effects provides you with four colour effects, a solar system effects, a velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantenfilter available.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing was solar, also Sabatier, also called Sabatier, an effect of emerged when you were partially developed a short flash light and then merged the development of the image. the result was a partial negatively negative of the picture. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect finely.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar stabilization. at about 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. another increase eventually creates a negativity that is not based on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that edited (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid Filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that he has a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it easy, he embellished many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight blamed color movie produced by the Japanese company Fujimovie. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated color but also some photos, especially those that are hardly landscapes abstained too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrastants. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the shielding repetitions the strength of the neon. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and therefore it is not uncommon to correct the colour counterast and the luminosity of the photos. you can try to experiment the different farms of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting you can preview in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">When you get a photo with bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem: one too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool Tonworthless to improve the exposure. even if the dialog appears to be very complicated for this tool, you need only the range of slider. concrete the three sliding below the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graphs of intention values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three sliding into the clicked, and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the picture. the left side represents the dark ones and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the controller and take care of how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed. the preview is dynamically, based on the setting of the image, updated. on the left hand side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be set whether the histogram is displayed with a linear image or logarithmic Y-axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear display of a single column is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three Regulators: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright notes, and the lowest for middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colours pinpetrol can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the entrances, middle and bright notes automatically. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Outputs: the payouts permit the selection of manual values for each area. here, two regulators can be used to change the outflow rate, for example, the compression of the exhaust can be used for example. the compression of the payouts can be used for example to create a slight picture as a background while doing something else in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the images are automatically set depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the specified values in the file system can be saved and later loaded. it will use the Gimp levels format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color mouths, the input will automatically be regenerated for all the shade, means and Sundays. activate the paint sprayer you want to use and click the preview of the original image of the histograms for red, green, blue and the Luminator channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overload detectors controls all shades to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the alignment of the entrances applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the payouts are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original is displayed as and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifications Channel: this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel which is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Besides this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that have been absorbed with a digital camera is most of the linear mode the linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you move e.g. a curventeil to the right, for example the bright notes, then you can see that these bright notes with darker outputs, and which are the associated image pixels darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marking to see. if you want to change this markings on the range you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is down to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve that you can create is stored in the filesystem and will be loaded later. the file format is the Gimp tourist format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you are using this method and the three shades of paint buttons, you automatically create the checkpoints of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and solar disk. activate the paint pipette that you want to use and click the original image to set the checkpoints for the red, green, blue and Luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overload detectors controls all shades to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-white photo, which has been corrected in the Luminator canal. shadow - and Sundays was set with the paint pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of & digicame; imaging is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colours channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the Kanaloptionally, you can select the color for the Histogram: this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the original area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red markers. if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the histogram to display you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you can activate Luminance, as the channel mixer then DAS tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix Monochmium, the reduction of a color comes to a visible noise which occurs from the color channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochmium conversion in which you reduce the farms first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storing as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender approach allows you to save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overload detectors controls all shades to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. here it is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it's not an effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which blue channel is newly jushed. the option Luminance is activated. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction capability. with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step, as color pictures can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rollerprofiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a green linsenfilter. this looks good, with all the scenery pictures and fits very well to portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Oranfilmed: simulates a black / white film coating with a bar Linsenfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. so similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter. this creates a dramatic sky-effects and can simulate moonlight for daily time. so similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film coating with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and medium tones, while he adds a bit coldness in the loop of a pressure and re-development in a septum. this is typical for the photographs of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digitised; tool texture apply you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color-image or not, you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait from enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall. the menu entry picture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the depth of the depth or three-dimensionality of texture in the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied to the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the parameter Relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digitised; tool frame can add a decorative setting to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative setting. this is a psychological barrier to the streak eye. under picture frames can add the module from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frmenttype for your image. passing the picture with a colored line, Niepce embraced it with a thin line and a broad frame (ideal for black-and white images), cooling down it with a nice three-dimensional frame of ideal for a high-dimensional effect and decorative adds an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited by 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">This will be larger than the original, but the original aspect ratio is bigger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool After side-ratios before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any position. this also goes to several places where you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text size, orientation, color from the color size and the character set. the larger the picture, the larger the character must be. at the end, simply choose a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background. already the picture is finished.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button 'OK'. once the image was saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & Image tool; tool Schstenone can use a template on an image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image template used in image processing can be used to put a template on a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil, there are no limitations regarding the size and orientation. if you want to add the PNG file format and you should want to add with maximum compression (9) to remove the file size of the stencil. if you want to add your stencil template, send an e-mail in English to the & digitised; mailing list promptly came-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you must put your switching folders with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the Schabovendales. these settings will be noticed for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the stencils, a tree-view, which reflects the folder structure of the Schablonenordner. selecting a folder is updated the thumbnail of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the underlying picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrub: this knob downsides the underlying picture. it is centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template on the whole picture, you need to change the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture under the template. take the picture and place it at the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template on your image. the image will then be automatically adjusted to the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicame; three different tools offer to the edge of the edge. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool to raise. it is very fast and easy, but produces, particularly in dark areas, grained images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharpened mask works at the contrast of edges to look an image sharper. indeed, it works rather a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dungeon and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require correction of sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution will therefore be a little blurring. the same phenomenon can be observed if color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more intolerating than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera has often been applied to an internal scale. images in the raw format, however, must always be deported during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanner turn a focal filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable them, you get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the edge-up technique. you can access it with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">They should hereby deal with this, however, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforced the noise. in general, the usable technique for sharpening an image is the tool refocus. at refocus, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to raise.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is to crisp. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than it too sharpening. use the tool for soft sign with the menu item softening and experiment some with settings. the pre-opener on the right side of dialogue will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is blurred - a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the pre-cursor shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first try out. an increase in the radius or the amount enhance the effect. if you create the insharpness mask too strong, noise and impression of caves near sharp edges will produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels on each side of a channel by the filter are affected. high-resolution images allow greater radios. you should therefore raise images of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original one. this makes the strength of the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling value is a break from the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. it is thus possible to define a minimum difference in order to be applied for a channel of filters. in this way areas with a soft change between the killers are exempt from sharpened from sharpening and therefore beauty-surfaces avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sponger = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">This & digitised; tool refocus refocus on an image by improving the edge. it used the copyright-protected filter algorithm used by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to revert a picture; in which there is a better approach than just try to raise the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for raising images is the use of a sharpened mask. refocus mostly reaches better results than unsharp. you can start it out of the menu by calling colors Refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular felling works much better than the Gauß'sche Faltung. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which leads far from the original quellpixels. the FIR Vienna inverse the Gauß'schen Faltung is influenced in most cases even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular edge: this is the radius of the circular line. it is the main parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should result in 1 good results. you can put a higher value, if your image is very blurred but should be careful on hallow.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0,99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharply effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely helpful. if the filter quality is too low, & eg; 0 is the image quality very bad. a high value will be further contaminated the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge's acuteness. this is most often caused by a previously unsharpness gauge. in most cases, you should avoid this value to 0 to avoid detonous artifacts. if you have a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / tubes.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matricher size: this value determines the size of transformational measurements. however, an increase in the size of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose great value for the circular uteness or the gauge's acuteness. please note, however, that the module will be very slow if you choose great value for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter which you set is set is saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all grants, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations make changes that are not immediately visible but left unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read images and compressed, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produced unsharp masking produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood than sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it needs to create blurred masons. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurredness. for the Viennese filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practical is the result of the FIR Vienna filters always at least as good as the hardy mask. the FIR Vienna Filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filtering, on a small unfocused image, see:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made using an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of raising the digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator dette puts the dissharpness of the zone of the cooled out, in order to generate a natural whomile.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color-tinte allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool in order to remove no desired artefacts with an unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The invention algorithm was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available pre-settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter preferences, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture p [0, 100]: this controls the conservation of the details. a small value leads to a moderate poll over the image. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no edge is necessary to be intolerable. please note that the details of the details are always subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Judge dependency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film graining or CCD Raue will produce a high value waveable pattern. JPEG artifacts are best placed in a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum glasses factor above ales. then defines the relative smoothing. put this value appropriate to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves greater structures. the higher the value is set, the more becomes smoothes, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effects, he must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually, there is 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-reaching as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha was chosen small, it should also be chosen small. pay attention to that small angle to produce a long run. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral loop [0,1, 10]: integral step in pixel. you should put the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel drain and never exceed 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality you get through the choice of this option is only low. but it doubles its duration. we therefore recommend it to leave it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as well as charging can make exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Picture errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load to move in. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button break.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture errors can be corrected using a little artifacts. the module is made in a photo that caused in Guatemala city with an analog camera. as you see there is a peculiar dun while the journey was created under (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digitization came; smoking reduction is a very powerful tool to lapping scruffles. it uses a protected algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selected image filters available to remove stains and other artifacts that are used by dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor plugs from the camera or modes; -effects of ed images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot of the screenshot shows a typical scene which has been made using a digital camera and a high standard of ISO sensitivities. it shows a graded noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can remain in default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for filters. large values increase the time the filter per pixel and can blurring the image. the space specified by the radius is moved by the image and the color in it becomes smoothes and thus minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the filter. this value determines the pixel. this value continues to change the filter changes. if it is increased, smokers should change. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer get and smoke or decorating it again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: control the edge-precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filters. if he is too strong can not remove the entire noise or smoke-tips can occur. put it on a value close to maximizing if you want to remove a watchful noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the illuminance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color intolerance of the picture. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically are amplified, to increase. it also polluted the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Shock absorption: controls the alignment of the adaptive filtering radius. this value is defined as fast the adaptive filter radius to occur when he is too high can occur, noise and phasenjitter can occur at the edges. he can remove spacing tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Storing and store: these buttons are used exactly for it. all parameters for smoking reduction you have set, can be stored into the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the smoke-reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is fortunately much easier than a picture to raise. use this tool for soft sign with the menu item softening and experiment with the smoother side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digitised; photo Restauration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photoarteammte.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts of your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's movies, scratches, compressible, and local errors that arise in digital, original or later digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the contours and thereby receives the content as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and text composition. the text condition is performed with another tool, the image error, conducted. the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannappe and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from being removed. as a loss of discomfort & quot; artefacts; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this attitude should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as well as loading exactly this. every adjustment of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can last very long and take a high CPU load to move in. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce how a photo with equidal noise will be restored.. The module is applied to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grains on the faces. the original picture is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example for the photo restoration. this time, textures was reduced to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner device. you can see the scan artefacts created by the scanner lighting and the photopapier. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digitised; tool Hotpixels allows you to remove pictures from a CCD camera, eight were to remove. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project which are protected by copyright by Martin dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixel are especially high-quality raw, photos a problem as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built-in oppression for hot pixel.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; and" quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark-view method to remove. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button daring. the tool will detect automatic and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the picture show.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important to record the dark picture directly in connection with new hot or bright pixels with CCD defect.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrective image. an automatic processing of the dark image becomes the bad pixel. note that the wizard feels the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the thumbnail will help you correct the outcome. the pre-showcase shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are taken out in all of the most varied areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. select the best filter method to interpolishing this pixelblocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durating: it becomes an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels on the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block, are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolishing the defective pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method. all pixels with a distance from 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the pixels in block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubically: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less will be moved to calculate a bi-Cuban interface (2-dim) or a group of Cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolishing the defective pixel in block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can view the Hotpixel correction to a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image was increased to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitization; vignetting correctly is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. subordinate corners, an image to correct.</seg>
<seg id="567">Foresees objective, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light that means the sensor there. telelenses show under circumstances also of this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, it also has cons. many Center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the blending filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. venerable objective should, even with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise loss-effects arise by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big exposures of today's filmenand and grey scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying an equivalente transformation to a raw material that is applied without this filter. the tool Vignetting correctly turns the transformation with a centerfilter on an image. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three reglers you can control the vignetting correctly and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light solidity absorption at the point of the largest density the filters. the standard density is 2.0, what a optical filter with a blending setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2, discharging. enhance the density to compensate a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the vigneting corrective reduces the luminosity of the pixel. you must revert the exposure of the target image with these options. the controller provide you with only positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a subtle reforming the exposure of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digicame; image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of vigneting correction to one image applied. the original image (1) indicates the corrected picture. a luminaire and contractution was also carried out in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digitised; Linsendistortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a protected algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. coloured distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second grades treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convexe form of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar circular effect, flacht but at the edges. this correction is not used in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient Grades corrected the remote corners opposite the second Grades. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion is almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">Generally, this value controls the strength of the distortion second grades. with negative values, tonical distortions can be corrected and positive values verrotor distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the Grades. this value works more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses the 'corners parameters has the reverse premark of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scalates the size of the image and thus leads to a correction first Grades through. negative values increases while positive the image is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value jushed the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a preview the distortion correct. the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons- or hoverical correction should be carried out before all grants or size changes. best to cut this correction as all of the first. if you make a picture anew, and then perform a tonical correction would be the effect apparent.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction is available to you this tool a vertical and a horizontal relief line. move it to an important place, such as the edge of the side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can correct the toning / hoverical distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a hoverical distortion, the resulting image is black corners. you can remove this with the allowance tool in transformers from the image processing or over the zoom regulator of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonical correction is made. the next logical step for some motives like e.g. shots from the front, frame and paintings, it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees. please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuro.c website which is accessible via this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotmovie, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangular with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Beneath the preview, you can adjust two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivities (ISO). the ISO regulator changes the quantity of film granulation and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter slot channels to reproduce by infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color formations are missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of infrared filthy effect applied to a landscaping of New Zealand. the original image is placed under (1) and the edited picture below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & D came; filter screens is a simple to use tool to reproduce movies on your pictures. this is from classic high-speed films like e.g. the B / W Kodak Tri-X, known. to increase the sensitivity of movies the manufacturer great silver grains of the photoemulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The filmmaker's effect gives your photo a certain mood or appears to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets a timeless atmosphere solved by daily life. if you want to use this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grazing sight especially in your monochrob photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to the control of intensity and granularity of the bodies. the default value is, although frequently higher values need to be needed, on ISO-2400. if you still need more Körner, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film body's effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked (2). the used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digitised; filter oil painting is created the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & quot; filter oil painting, gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature images and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two shelves to influence this effect. the top choose the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better for big images. glasses are controlled by the glasses or, from the other side, seen the uniqueness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and this is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size picture is 1 and Trosette 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & D came; filter coal labyrinth uses color and intensity gradient to create a stolen frame in the drawing. images of their gradient are slowly changing and therefore are not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to scure you. these would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper controller elects the pin size and the lower jushes the contrast (glasses).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coherence filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved by adaptation of the Intensive value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & quot; filter engraving is shaped your image in 3-D as if it was tempting in wax. it uses a protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & quot; filter engraving is a quick tool to return your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in terms of content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity in order to transform the image into a gray, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork using a distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft blocks 1: divide the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wellenblocks 2: analogue to the wave blocks 1 will be distorted the image here with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal picture in a work of artwork using insharpness effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Unsharpness: wiped the image along the star-shaped lines that go out of a centre. this simulates the blurredness a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial nonsense: wired the picture by turning the pixels to a center. this simulates the harness of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal: blurring the image around the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement sharpness: caught the picture by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurredness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photograph, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softeners: blurring the image soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle light.</seg>
<seg id="620">Bulk solids: caught the picture by random shift of pixel and simulates the insharpness of an arbitrary moveable camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent insharpness: finds the colouring in the picture and blurring it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it, by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice little tool to make regentropes on your image. thereby it gives natural your images a nighting appearance. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyright-protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Drip size allows to change the size of the tropes. as the droplet size does not automatically increase with the size of the image. number changes the number and the density of drops. fishing changes the optical effect of drops in the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free from regentropes. use the selection tool to select the area, for example a vision, which should remain free. if you start the filter shelf, the area will remain free of regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the shelf filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">When the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation. the tools for this can be found in the transformers of turning or transits mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflatable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture to shrern is simple. the big question is, how can you reap an image and keep the details sharp? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good work. try him and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">When a photo has the wrong size you can change it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is below to see.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to enlarge the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try to inflate the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many imaging programs use a kind of interpolation, i.e. Spline Interpolation to enlarge an image. & digitised; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflatable has been developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratios: when this setting is activated, the input of the new size is maintained with the original image of the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter involves greater structures. the higher the value is set, the more becomes smoothes, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's turbulence effects, he must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The buttons Save as well as charging will be used exactly for this. every entry for photo can enlarge as text file and will be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflatable is very fast with what it makes, but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load for yourself. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflatable by using a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (2) is the result of linear default augmentation.</seg>
<seg id="640">The loss of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a often underestimated tool to create a picture. the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pull the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photographs will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo is to cut down. you can change the size of the calculator. you can create a new rectangle by clicking it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button Recorder button in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file saving or storing in the menu file to save the newly created photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbarea you can change the size of the rectangular by postpone the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue will remain intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on page ratios, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After side ratios uses a relative aspect ratio. that means it is always the same, regardless of whether you can use centimetres, inch or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons exist for the selection automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in dialogue, you can sit with the Max. ratio of the area to grant to the maximum possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation, set.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After aspect ratio, saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the write-up tool the next time, these settings are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data are reflected the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The configuration settings allow to help you to put your pictures better, so that you can get your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic particle are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party, harmonic triangles are a possibility of sharing a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that appears on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus sea or the spütlets of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational figure 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and the Greeks who thus used your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number runs from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where every figure is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that is followed by this rule is regarded as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle represents liquid relief lines if you put an image below. these help will be considered below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral, you will bring your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third elregel, the golden spiral creates a liquid line of the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the view of the beholder along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectances of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangular. it should give something that the eye can be at the center of the composition. that can be a line or different objects. this may simply be there without the eye to guide it becomes its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden triangles also lead from the above discussed golden spiral. its vertices are the middle points of the sides of the golden triangles. please note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, Golden triangles are not synonymous triangles. Diagonale to put on these lines can be a static object of dynamical.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles to break up your frame generate an effect of professional photographer dynamic symmetry. try to place your image focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options horizontal and flip-flip can be used to mirror the harmonic submissions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colours and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it doesn't happen that you're watching the camera just vertically or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things came around a corner. you can repair this with the & digitization; image processing and tool-free rotation. choose to compose free rotation and jusze the destination angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the default values are indicated in degrees. with the button presets you can set the slider again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the top right above.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the module is free Rotation a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you set it on an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now jusze the angle as described in previous sections.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you turned into an image you will find unwanted holes in the corners. an opportunity to repair it is to use the function transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is automatic subsidies. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. but take note of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspeculative transformations are carried out by a fixion of the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red quadrances to the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of dialogue, you will find some information which help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created through the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left of the transacted area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transacted area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transacted area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right bottom: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transacted area.</seg>
<seg id="676">According to the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes somewhat polluted. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments produce an twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasantly triangular holes in the corners. an opportunity to see this is to cut the picture with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The loop is used to postpone part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal resolution, i.e. the image becomes distorted. with other words, a rectangle becomes transformed into a parallelogram. you can start this module via transformation.</seg>
<seg id="679">Move your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can switch horizontal and vertical at the same time. if you press on presets, the angle will appear on zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help will be a vertical and a horizontal line. move the mouse to a crucial point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tooling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image becomes a bit tipped. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two flocks generated twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After shearing the image has a beautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate this is to cut the image with transformers from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicame; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries compilized. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digitised.</seg>

<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographical localisation puts tools available for images geographically in spherical coordination system, used by GPS and Galileo. height, longitude and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localisation Correlator. this interface can create a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and call the menu. to load up a possible correlation over time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. this file contains of course data that were recorded at the same time as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file loaded a automatic correlation, the coordinates are recorded in red-times. GPS Spurdata is recorded in GMT-time and therefore the caceit must be recounted with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone. place your camera zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The adjustment for the maximum time variance gives a high deviation for the GPS time and caceit. lies the deviation below are the data assembled. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for images you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the pictures. the difference between 2000 seconds then will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolishing and differential can be used when you don't have appropriate data. if you know that in reality, a locating difference between camera and GPS is, you can set these limits here and then push the button correlation to the interpolishing press.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos in the same place. as the dialog remarked the coordinates from a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">Location can also be found with the attached map and enlarge. select this time and enlarge. get this again and again through until you have reached a considerable accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the map can be switched between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>

<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module created the pages, the window will not automatically closed. you can therefore read the programing reports to determine if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start in order to preview the preview of the gallery. press shots around the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI imaging rate is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI imaging rate allows Ihnene to look at a selection of images and perform on them basic operations such as screenings, zooming or moving. the viewer can be using short-missing and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, an image is displayed by default in full-screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG loss is a tool to change images without compromising quality without any quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images in the JPEG format, without the usual losses on quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is it increases the file size, since no compression of the colour information is taking place. this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera-Klient is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>

<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another. then select the import function in the main program and then call on the import function, so the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied afterwards to the button OK.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not in any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in form of a diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Kodizer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the packages of MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a base frame. you can also add an audio file in MP2 or WAV.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scalable to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally you can select a background color for the Diaschau. with this module, it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. afterwards, you can start using the extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also modify sorting the images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">Once you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. video format can be chosen from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan the file on a TV, you have to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, Secam or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that will indicate the image below. a low value creates very sudden, high on the opposite picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt you should leave it black. the name and the path of the generated file you can specify under the name of the MPEG-output file. keep it as possible as the extension mpg.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file, then you will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your preferences. depending on the speed of your machine you can now get a cup of coffee and enjoy the diaschau when you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that codeners or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button settings right down.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer assistant allows multiple images to be printed on a piece of paper together in standard photosizes. the combined images can also automatically be opened with the image Gimp. this is e.g: useful to enhance you or to print with the Gimp module for direct expression.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import and convert your images into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command lines dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original version of Him is: do you expect the same results as the software from your comrades. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file is to be converted and start the module. the Raw image konverter window appears in mode for a single image. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now reuse the values new to optimize the converting process. the first option decides if the camera settings are to be used for white. the essential parameters such as Gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be used. if the result is not optimal you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colors RGBG Conversion can be selected for you to use the contrasting information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss-hairy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the loss-free LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">In case you plan to edit your pictures frequently or to use later otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata are stored in the RAW file in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to break the process again, you can use it off.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stacker processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing at a single picture, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility of downloading the file automatically. this is helpful if you have been created in an earlier attempt. a preview is not available. a preview is not available. however, the progress has progressed as far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the Starscore and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can change the image smaller or enlarge. these include four types of images available:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): scale change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed during this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: preparing the picture for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photopiers. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred E-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the coming pictures before. additional pictures can be drawn to the list of images to be downloaded and discard it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you started the module you will see the pictures window with the images selected by you. you can add additional pictures with a file optionally dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and take a look at the list of images to be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button pictures, the selected images are removed from the list of recent images.</seg>
<seg id="876">Once you have selected all the pictures you can open the new message window of your e-mail client. you just need to add the addresses and the subject. you have already attached the addresses below.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not pay attention to many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations for the size of the emails. it may possibly be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and everytime used until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must install the GMailAgent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the posting of comments in a fixed file, the comments on the images are put together into a text file and address the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality cannot be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under images file format and the original files in the JPEG format are, then the original extrusion data are added to the larger images.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down the status messages, in search of errors, can be viewed. your e-mail program will automatically start at the end. with the button shot you can loop this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module's Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like you would like to show your diaschau. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions displayed in the presentation activates very elegant captions via OpenGL. however, you need to possess a corresponding graph card, since otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">This option will display filename that the filename of images can be displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop. you can then manually break it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are shown in a random order. so it will not be the order of the images used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Taking delay between the pictures can be set the time gap between individual images. 1500 milliseconds comply with 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen effect. so you should austest before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. by chance, at any transition between the images you choose another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During Diaschau you can access a toolbar at the top left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn you on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can keep the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="894">On the left side of the screen you can see the current date, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date justate currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.org. for: the participants in this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module currently uses selected images, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as a background for your KDE workspace.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with comments, you can watch with & kphotoalbum. by this browses, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, therefore in person, places and in group keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you see the categories, for which you have typed information as you have provided your pictures and videos with notes. additionally, there are entries to view to EXIF-based information, viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current thumbnails. in the following, each one is described above.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press with the mouse to the entry persons, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you choose another person only the images are displayed on which both individuals are visible. by this selection, you can restrict the number of images from a few thousand pictures to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view with thumbnails to view the images of your area.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of its name. you can save with & photoalbum. however, for each person you can save its own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords, and other categories that you have defined themselves. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button which is located right outside on the toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can display e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you do not have appropriate images).</seg>
<seg id="905">You must also specify which image for each individual person is to display. to display this, you need to display the image asset window (in detail), and in the context menu you will see the image for the appropriate person. in the select window you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your requirements and thereby selecting which part of the image is to be displayed and cut down.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you call in the main window, you will see a dialog, which is very similar to the dialogue for fixing the picture properties very similar. this dialog can be seen at the picture once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the labeling or description, the signments or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want you can also be a date of the total datums, i.e. for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are pictured.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the manual for & kftalbum.. if you do not like to read handbooks, but rather would like to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and look at the quick entry, the screen photos and the TV videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & dress album; and select in the first dialogue the demo, if you start & kash album; for the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry box. you will be loaded some sample pictures and you can test the functions of & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of "" "" koloch "" "." you see the timeline. an image of this bar is shown here: "" "" as the name suggests, this bar shows you filum statistics about the images in your database. "" "</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display you several different time units. each Leiste then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. in the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline allows you to interact in the following ways: you can change the displayed comments preview of the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date in the preview appears) and besides, the timeline will always display the current date of the currently shown images when you look in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of timeline by keeping the mouse button depressed and use the mouse over the lineal of the timeline, so the timestamps are drawn. if you select an area, you will only click pictures of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Dress album; provides you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images. one is included in & colder album. the following part of the user guide will be described in & kphotoalbum. integrated version, which you can create via the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and target. in the following, every area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the moment and a description which is to contain the HTML file later. click the photoalbum, HTML-sample pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, you choose whether a & photo album; export file will be created to see the page page. nutritional information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed in the viewer. for example, that all pictures are exported from a party. for example, that all pictures are exported from a party. for example, you can't use this attitude to hide certain images from specific considerations.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are obvious why not specifically received this.</seg>
<seg id="923">Down on the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thereby, those who have a look at your website and have a monitor that includes the maximum resolution 800x600, no images downloaded, for example a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your side may change the resolution at any time. so he can browse your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission period. if he wants to display an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you create the different folder and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best select for all your HTML files, and for each subsequent set a new subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you will need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder is stored and automatically set up for all future images. here you can select either a folder or one of KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if this really is all done for viewers. if you choose the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, the URL you specify here should be this folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files do not exist in the final target folder you have to manually copy it manually. hence the import function, see, properly functions, you must specify the final target of the files, but the base subfolder in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have changed all three to base subfolders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is laid down, whose name suggests you in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are sitting on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kicking album. however, if you have already spent a lot of time for viewing the images, to write pictures, etc., then you have to write with & kftalbum. this work will not even make this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Address album; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they distinguish yourself if the images are stored in the file or whether in the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of all images to save in the file is that you may have all the images and that file can be transmitted as independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can select a .kim file either directly from the menu file exporting... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file is looking for the pictures in a double way. first, the images are not found in the folder of the .kim file. the appropriate pictures are not found, so the images of the URL you have specified when you create the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for the extrusion of images described, which you can call via the menu file exporting...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialogue is whether it should act on internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">When you install manuell near the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically to copy the Automatically in the vicinity of the .kim file, copy the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth the files to compressed. if you want this anyway, just select the option export file compress.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size. if you want to send your friends pictures, since the .kim file would otherwise be very big. here you can limit the size by example, for example, that every image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importers... select the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to importers consists of four steps. first, you have to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It can be that you personalise the category persons of the imported file (if you are a dined), while this category is asked for your database persons. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialogue window, which categories that are imported to imported file and which categories they comply with in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">The fourth step allows you to include the categories of imported file with the categories of your current database. one example is shown on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It needs to be simple to browse images and view: if you see images you often want to watch within different picture groups & mdash. if you are looking for example images of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend to discover, you might want to see all pictures on which this friend is pictured.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this handbook you will pass the different steps from (1) fixing the information about your pictures, about (2) to look through and look up to (3) advanced themes and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">The Photoalbum was started as a program to steward your pictures. but it has been extended and today your videos. at many places in this handbook will be talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& Clock album, saves all its information in the file index.xml at the top folder of their images. these are a simple XML file that you can provide with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions on the CVS where they like.</seg>
<seg id="950">& A photo album; notes the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically. if you want to check out another folder in & kphotoalbum. in case you have a different folder with images, you can run & kphotoalbum; with the option -c. as example: kakalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry settings dress album; set up to a window, with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum. in the following section of the user guide, you will explain the different settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can view six different symbols, with which you can view the preview of the preview and options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call through a keypress on the F1 button and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">In case you have described how you can define different properties, e.g. persons, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as items, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog, which is used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a signment and select a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories were already mentioned. in dialogue options you can set up complete members groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group, rather than in a group, rather than explained in a group as in one group.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the settings for setting up the members are available. with the above selection list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window, there is a list with the current category and in the right a list of the categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kftalbum: shares his modular system with other graphics applications, such as digiam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin interface. nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the menu modules. they can not be described in this handbook because they are not part of & colder album. however, most modules have a help page, which you can access via the modules itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications to each other together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum; demo-database can always be tested first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures application. you can either call them on the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum - demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules on KIPI, are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & colder album. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & cold album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are using their pictures in albums: this is an album simply a folder. even if & photoalbum, this kind of order is not supported, simulates it for some modules that order for albums, so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">The current album is simulated, the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album must & koloalbum, the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here goes & kftalbum: as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If we show the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the setting dialog as category for virtual albums. so, if you want to use the category persons, your photo will have chosen for example; so if you have chosen individuals to view the module and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the context modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you can see an example of a starter screen, once you start & a photo album, starting with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, take a look at the top of a menu and a toolbar. at the moment we don't see a lot of information on your pictures. in the section we will come back to this window, but then click on the entry pictures, which shows you an overview with all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with notes. this includes information on the persons appearing on the picture etc. you can put on any picture separately or for a larger number of images certain notes at the same time. if for example, pictured on all pictures of Jesper and all pictures in Copenhagen have been included.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by setting people, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photogenic album; as you will always use it when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is the shifting of images in the list: if you are pictured for example a family party and in all 50 images are shown the same 5-10 people, you can therefore have the used names shifted upwards to find people faster and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetical list below, click on the icon for sorting out date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected any comments on each picture individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and provide those pictures with any comments. just click on the back and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an overgroup. to view you that this is an overgroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the step-catalogue, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally you can also put an entry into a category of this item. attention, this presupposes that you just sort out your categories alphabetically. see this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can postpone the individual elements of the post-catalogue by clicking the Leiste, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and move. you can also make a separate window by setting it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window so to your needs, click on the button Options..., which offers you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can have a frame also complete. if you want to see this window later on, use the button Options... and then you can see a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will receive an overview with thumbnails of currently selected images, or of all images in case you don't have a filter. an example will be shown here. you can configure the size of the thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, configure. try it simple.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you leave an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be displayed in the image viewer. if you don't have a window opened with an image viewer, a new display will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the picture show. just select the appropriate pictures you want to delete and select either the Delete button or select in the menu Edit menu. now you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& Clock album; for this problem you can use a solution. you can also use the images saved on your hard drive. of course, you need to keep images stored on your hard disk. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum. if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Pictures, in which the right upper corner is cut off, are not stored on the hard drive. however, this is available for example with the pictures 1-9. however, the thumbnails are available, so you can view the preview of these pictures. however, you can also view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function requires that you want to copy files out of the folders and copy again. if so, you don't want to worry about how the mess bracing of your pictures would like to avoid, please buy a larger drive to save all images to it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to block a little more privacy, filter the images so that at the end you want to block any other inaccessible and click Current View in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also view all images that can see your little sister, conteuder and the menu item All besides current views.</seg>
<seg id="990">In order for you to specify which pictures in the case of the case are to be hidden. if you lock the laptop now your little sister, so select all the images you've blocked, hidden. if you want to see the pictures again, click on Sperre.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that must be typed to block the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. for one are all images on the hard disk and the others can access the password as unencrypted text or delete. this type of password protection serves only to those who work with & kphotoalbum. not very familiar to repel the view of private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you can describe all of your pictures with & kftalbum; manage and spend hours more than hours so you want to see them sometime. for this reason, you can look at them sometime. for this reason, you can look at a picture _ and video clip. this is what you can preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it naturally shows the image, but additional all the information you have to enter about the image, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can simply drag this with the mouse and put elsewhere. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer. then you can see the right-click menu below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser, see suitable entries for this display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and switch back to the picture below. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and end. these features are also accessible from the context menu.</seg>

<seg id="999">A very useful skill of the beholder of & kftalbum; it is available in full-screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the entry button to switch to full-screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can move into the image and pull out zooming. with the Minus button you can easily drag a rectangular button. with the Minus button you can get back rauszooming The Plus button zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button you can reset your zoom, so that the image does not be zoomed. with the equitable version sets the Zooms, so that each pixel equivalent to the screen of a pixel image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work on videos that are in and out of zooming with the Plus- and Minukeys.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the turnfunctions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current image with the menu item from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen to put an image with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can preview the picture and Configuration dialog of the picture to insert this name. however, they will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and consider other photos.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer in order to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want to start the viewer with images and mark it as good or bad as you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above gives you the viewer the possibility to watch pictures with characteristics while you watch them. features are the letters A to Z and you can make a characteristic that you press the corresponding letter. in view one picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available to you in your browser. so, if you have all the images you can edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can easily use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the thumbnail. if you see categories in Dre preview, then you can add features to the images by pressing the letter for the characteristic after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow you to paint your photo album.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not stored with the image, but in the database. in the way you can revert your own old one later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In fact you can see an image on the painted one. to switch the painting mode from the context menu. to end the painting, simply put the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you have to master the application of the program & Povray; not complete, but the documentation about & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree, you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and display the object in the wire modell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all the sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To add a new object to the object tree, select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon at the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following folding menu is finished, so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With delete either from the menu bar under editing or from the right-click menu of the right mouse button you can immediately remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on applicators to take these changes. have you posted invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can click on the input errors or throw the changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user's documentation in the setting dialog box, you can call the & Povray; reference to the selected object using the help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this property. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains already the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can preview a preview in the Featural view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the Featurating view and a small example of the scene is displayed with the selected texture, even if you want to have selected a subordinated item (for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), you cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the checkpoints of the camera. you can drag these checkpoints with the mouse button, and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the checkpoints will disappear and it becomes a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and spin and the position for relocating. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object appears as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as an absolute value. objects will only be displayed when they are selected or their visibility level smaller or equal to the visibility level of visibility in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need another order, you can adjust them as you can. you can also save several shutters and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under an existing view, drag the starting point to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starting point to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the overall height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange a number of views over each other, drag the starting point to another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card's driver on top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order is unraging views: views which are not enshrined in the main window. to resolve a view from the anchor, drag the starting point to the desktop, or click the small to the left top arrow in the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the panel bar. to prevent the shot, click on the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the menu view you will find entries for any type of views. new views are shameful, you can anchor them in any position.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view will save you with view window order... save it. there will be a dialog displayed in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">When you have created a scene, you can renders them. & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual has been written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is currently supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renders the current scene, click on the icon Render The symbol Renders in the toolbar or select the menu view scene renders.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s files. it determines the size and quality of the rendering. if you want to add a scene in different sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many renaming modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon of The Render settings in the toolbar, or in the menu view Render modes... select the following dialog is opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each rendering mode has a name. you can input any name, but it is a name that lets the properties of the mode be recognized.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size, you can list the width and height of the left image. if you want just to renders a small area of the image, select the crossbox subsection and enter the image section for rendering into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties that's used & Povray. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the rename features can be found in the user manual to & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is rolled with only one ray from pixels, different bugs can arise. these images often have a Moiré-pattern or stuary effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. in general see pictures with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you switch anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a beam je pixels. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling is adaptive; recursively, because every pixel is getting further distributed and adaptive because the recursions depend on calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, tracts POV-Ray a ray of pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the nearby pixels, then both pixels are calculated by pursuing a certain extra number of pixel with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value on 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predetermined threshold, then the pixels will be divided into 4 sub-pixels that are being pursued individually and set to further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the production of smokers for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn Jittering, modified & Povray; the rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of the Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this cardboard card you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixels is then transparent when the accompanying rays have not made an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for viewing the & Povray. if & Povray; unexpectedly ends, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; to import the menu, select the menu entry file... and select a file in dialogue window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete instruction lsuming of & Povray; if at beekeeping error messages or warnings, a dialogue window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import this source between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, just select the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renditions. usually this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in Featurating view, open & kpovray; user's documentation for the displayed object. place the path to your documentation and the version a. supported the version 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. high altitude) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of library, the first found file is used.</seg>

<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for viewing the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type label.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the item from the points to the Raster in the context menu of the wire model view. you can set here the grid separately for shifts, scalding and rotating.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values give a more precise wire model and therefore a better sewing for the displayed objects, but require more time to rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detailed stage for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">When you cross the High details fidelity for extended projections, all projections are further divided into the projections. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you see wall view, a wall behind the objects will be removed. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you want to display soil, a floor is displayed below the objects. the floor is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate edge-glasses, the non-recursive antialiasing method is used for rendering scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information about the parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window systems. in the section window arrangement, you can create and store shutters.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The combination field standard window order: displays all existing window arrangement. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window appings displays all existing window arrangement. a new arrangement can create you with the button Add and delete an selected order with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order. new views can create and delete selected views with the button removal.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column create a new column on the right hand side of the available window, with ouncing the window below the existing window, using carton board you get a cardboard card along with the previous view and shamefully anchored the view not in the main window but also creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to follow without more exact knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but easy scene, under beginnings: a bullet on a layer.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings, before you complain that you will get as a result just a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should note these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you cannot set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert lighting sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, take a look at the first launch of & kpovmodeler; the following presented window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation, so that you can get a proper idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starting with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all the objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item for editing. you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire-model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you generate. in particular, you notice this in the fourth wire model view (right down). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderns of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object-tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you see the content of the view object attributes, in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject later instructions, but note that the camera in the view points will change, with which you can change the target point of the camera. just click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button on the button or the input button, the wire-model views and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are lots of ways to create the ground for the scene. you could insert a quader (inserting body Quader) and the size on x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a nonrepresentational method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a easier way. you can use an infinite plane as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the button applicator or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be immediately displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now shows the level if also at the moment only as a limited endant level. if you renders the scene, the level stretches up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree, you will notice that you can click on the item + before the object. in this case you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters of the object. in this case you will find the different parameters for each new object: scale, spin and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horizon line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">Just choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog, where you can choose how the object is to be inserted. you can change the name in the object view. you can view the name in the original view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment will look now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigments only shows a matured black material because you can still need to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview. give you now the colors for the pigment. also, there are many options now, but take the simplest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't want to see any color in the quader and ball in the preview, click on the button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now properly set. if your image is now with a click on the icon, you should get the following results:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, that is not the farthing you expect. here are other settings necessary. in the color list, you need to enter two new attributes. then you can edit this entry twice (you can also do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the object-tree every time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should just run this step as you should have understood the basic functionality of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object features you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button on the button), so that the ball rolling over the ground, since you have moved the floor around a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering results in a strange result: as before, the ball surface appears like a matured black material. put in the next step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can assign it to a material now. as already on the floor, type the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First subobject and change the name for example in ball pigment. click on the ball pigment, then select the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the button or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings sheen effect and reflection has already yielded some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you are & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a rendering method to generate a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you hit a scene raytracen, shoots of renderer's hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera, which reduces the scenes) through the objects and how atmosphere effects, such as fog effects. thus, the scene pixels are processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you will also see nothing, the image is simple black. obviously, every scene that shall be looted, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file you have previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Always when you open a new model or create a new model, the file is inserted into this submenu and replace the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already stored the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and storage space.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump-map is a way to avoid consuming surface without any boil on the surface individually model and without changing the geometrical form of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file for both a bump map as well as for texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometrical forms that you can use as components: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further edited to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel base, using a picture file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP-Interface of Amarok has many general functions which are mostly also found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlists, playlists browser and scripts. an example call for the DCOP function break could & eg; look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarook supports the headlines of Qt and & kde; additionally, Amarook has some own command lines.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all the required modules are available and make use of dialog, so the user note why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">BEGIN require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the folder scripts / templates, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts, or simply add them to the required functions. you will quickly find that the writing of scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP you can exchange data with Amarook and Amarook. the easiest way is the use of the instruction dcop; which should be included in each KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execute of external programs and commands. this will usually be called exec () function. in this way it can be called dcop &gt; relatively easy. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends alerts to all running scripts. to this reason, strings should constantly monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure command is the script to view the setup dialog. to save the store and loading of the furnishings, each script must take care of each script. if a script is started, Amarok uses the workfolders to the folder where all the data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signaled that a new piece is played. the script could now ask for example; with DCOP functions further information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume signaled a change of volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuclicked: submenu above contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu clicked on. to add a listing to the menu, you can use the DCOP-function dcop Amarok script addveMenuItem (submenu Of Title).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarook; terminated, or if the user stops a script, sends & Amarook; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to do so. for example, storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script can also install script packages that the user & eg; downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2), which can be optional also with bzip2 (.bz2), so that the user can clearly detect the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extended amarocscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right correctly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main kript must be executable (+ x), the remaining Additional modules should not be executable. use the Tar-parameter -p to get the file right:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and link the link to the Wiki script page of & Amarok; attached. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amaro; script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarook; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarook; has many useful and powerful functions and still is surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarook; you can easily drag music to the playlist instead of going through endless menus. perhaps you are looking for only one particular title of thousands of pieces in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collectors' browser and the Quick Search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarook: is an audio player for Unix systems (like & eg; Linux). further information can be found in the summary of features and gallery of screens.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarook needs only the package Kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you must have Kdelibs installed (including those contained in it, because & Amarook; requires some of them written to have e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide, how to compile Kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD set out that your window manager will function the relevant standards of freedesktop.org, but fluxbox will work for example, but we try to support AmaroK on all platforms, therefore we use Kdelibs and Qt because they set up an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Most likely, one of your files will make a mistake in the day Lib library. you can check the file at ~ / .kde / share / p / Amarok / collection _ scan.kde.org and hang on the caputte file that causes the crash. then you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of this is that Taglib when reading the meta-info from this file crashes. please report this bug to the taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try again SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok; is a bit mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarook; used libraries with the same compiler version have been compiled. if B. & Amarook; with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.x, this leads to dismantling the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you are using KDE using artsd, then disable machines. off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens at a crash). if it is a frequent turn-down and send us a good backtrace, the error will be guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into meta-info, but they do not mark as Unicode. the following Perl script raises the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "file $argv [0]; play _ v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag = $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: icon lookup error: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixr. please check if Amarook is the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this error, you possibly need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarook is the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several ways. most of the installation problems clarify the lightest by means of an expert for your Unix - or Linux distribution. you can also use help with other users or with developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarook; only a blank playlist will appear. how do music pieces come in?</seg>
<seg id="1260">That is easy. use the file's browser to the left and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To intuitively keep the surface intuitive, the start-window has been converted into the Statistik-Window. you will find it under extras.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the Gad driver with the Alsa Sink, the device must use a blender. a blender enables multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously reach an audio module. this can be reached by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for alsa.</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in search of the problem of murmness and a solution. for Streamer, you may need to specify another Sink (e.g. ossals).</seg>

<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to change to the Ghoamer driver, crashes & Amarook; off. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing Ghoamer, you need to register all components. run GST-register to register all Gstreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if this does not help, you can also ask the IRC channel # gstreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (end AmaroK before!): - Download your ffmpeg, compile and install it. then remove the module-folder of Gstreamer all ffmpeg files (you will find the module-Folder with GST-config / gstreamer-config) and run GST-register again. start now & Amarook.</seg>

<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically reproduce all videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge projects recently. the associated submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Saves the current project. if the project has been saved once, the previous file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Saves the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog will be displayed, with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Saves all the opened projects. that's the same as if you call for each individual project file saving.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Includes the current project. if a project has changed and not yet saved, asks & K3b; after what has to happen. you can then choose between saving and changes. besides, you can also drop the loop and keep the project open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Includes all open projects. & K3b; will be asked for any not stored project, which should be done to pass, just as if you were called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all the opened projects and finished & K3b. for each non-saved project will be asked what to do with it, as if you called the file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select from the appearing dialog files to the project. that's the same effect as if you're using the files directly from the top view in the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the files that are added in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & K3b; for burning the medium, can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the characteristics-dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is this? -Help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears in an active data-CD / DVD or video DVD project. this is useful when you're using files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful when you are not using files for a multidisciplinary CD. it is useful for you to be used rather than help to see the files already available on the medium already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears in an active data-CD / DVD or video DVD project. this function led & K3b; imported files from the current project. all other files will remain in the project. this feature removes no files from the medium, they blends only the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-copying dialog. this also allows the copying of a CD to another medium. alternatively, you can also just want to burn a picture of a CD. additionally, there is also the possibility of Klonn instead of normal copier. you should prefer fractures when you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copying dialog. this also allows without the project file to create a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also only get a picture of a DVD using the copying dialogue will not be supported, therefore the target medium must be big enough to record the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW. this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to the formatting of a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), whereby the contents can be completely deleted. & K3b gives you the choice between writing and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burns a previously erased CD-image. the dialog asks you after a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, therefore you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burns a previously erased DVD image. the dialog asks you after a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned down by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously unsuccessful DVD video can be converted. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view, but it can also be used on-standing video, coding and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the occasional medium. this information is displayed in the content view and contain properties of the medium, such as size and title-length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbar of & K3b; if an entry is crossed, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small bar at the bottom of the window appears. it contains information about the status of & K3b; and its activities. if this is not crossed, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Switches the folder view, or off. the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the index view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media info, lock and locking the drive or throw of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Switches the table view one or off. the table view allows to choose and draw files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs, provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">When copying the copes in the project view is a narrower range, which is only visible when the project view open projects contains. the Copy list has no real function, it looks only pretty, and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialogue window to change the keyboard arrangements for & K3b. after one of the commands has chosen in the upper part, you can adjust the keyboard rules below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the K3b; setup assistant. you can set the proper permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. therefore, system managers are required, therefore, you must enter the password for the system administration (root) when starting the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & K3b. here you can set the settings of & K3b. almost all functions of & K3b; you should work on tap. this dialog is intended to personalize and to the refinement of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also, with a & DCOP; interface equipped. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions to use, you can either use the command line program dcop, or the slightly more comfortable program kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionality, so it's more to be your taste and the type of your task setting, which the accompanying programs you give you.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line dcop. to make use of the & DCOP, you must make sure that & K3b. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions, all of the & kde; have in common, supported & K3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Standard DCOP interface of & K3b; features features such as copyCD, formatformat DVD and additional features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createWebDProject () DCOPRef createWebDProject () The COPRef CreateMoeXDProject () void my Dvd () void Lovvd () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burndImage (Kururl)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (K3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project will be obtained via # dcop K3b K3b Interface currentProject Durch using this reference, it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createfolder (Qstring name) void createfolder (Qstring name, Qstring Parent) void vitveItem (Qstring path) void renal VolumeID (Qstring path, Qstring Name) void setVolumeID (Qstring name)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then adds files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b Interface createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT Createfoldable / foo dcop $PROJECT addUrl / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audiocreator; is an audio CD; reading for & kde;. with it you can easily read audio CD; s out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible, depending on the Encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audiocreator; the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading from & CD; data contained in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many Kodierers that support these WAV files (lossomer packages will still be installed from the Linux distribution). additional codeners can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or also in other formats such as the loss of FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD; it is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia used. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not installed yet, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvored (for MP3) or other co-codes are already available, it is therefore very likely not necessary to compile something yourself. however, only the code modules are not used, the installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which code / file format is to be used? the chapter Welcher Kodizer gives a small introduction to cooking, audio quality and compelling factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word on the copying of protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & audiobeholder; cdparanoia for reading the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to avoid any copying audio CD; even if not the firmware of copying, it is not possible to avoid the mechanisms of copious audio CD; simply avoid the purchase of Copierine Audio-CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once must be made (the setting dialog box may be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), returns the daily handling of a & CD; this leads to the hard drive for the slim approach of the user interface, which you can often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; information from the freeDB can get out of the Internet or can fully work without network, whereby everything is manually recorded.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example there are more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program.</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available Encoder so that the selection with another Encoder can be read as the default. it is to be noted that previously the Encoder has been configured in the default dialog box in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager, so that an already selected file will be chosen rather than full & CD; read and codify.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog around the type of alerts (like protocols, Piepsen) for programming events (like reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main character dialog of & audiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, to set up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, cooking and compression rates and helps you choose the right code.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss of free audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may possibly be available to this distribution. the downsides are low compressing and barely available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data dressers depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG might have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps) but above this bitrate the differences will produce very good audio quality since both Kodians produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame will still be supplied with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrate), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bitterness.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a machine or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereosystems. today - initially, these devices are not only the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This attitude gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually provide for most people and most musical pieces of acceptable transparency, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and car stereosks. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo plants.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which are manually inserted manually or through the program automatically from the freeDB over the Internet are available as a list of parameters. you can be passed / used with & audiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodical programs, there is often a combination of programming settings for the code of code and these parameters. the manual or help to the Kodierern explain the switches to these programmes.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are coded with lame, the switch set of lame and the title parameter of & audiocreator; added: the result is as follows: '... set {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= Knopfbeg in assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">That's what the freeDB is: a free database to read / enter the audio CD, so that all other information can be downloaded instead of using yourself into the computer. it is to be noted that here only the text is spoken: & CD; titles, artist, names of pieces & etc; not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I do not mean it. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; so no one can prevent the information publicly available on the & CD; and in addition, the information cannot be added to the artist or the CD; all information can be obtained in case of a bumblebee by a & CD; shop, physically or virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; active a cross-box address (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems that the e-mail address may not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This may only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & audiocreator; used for the use of freeDB, the geographical server will be used in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org returns a current list of mirrors for online retrieves of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which read program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that this cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more accurately, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed at first if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the extractive WAV files the code can be chosen and thus the desired file format is selected. at first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compressing for audio data) on the tab for setting the code. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the code can be used. this is also required for the predefined code. more information about codiers can be found in the chapter of the code.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, further information can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a solitary window (eg. console). this must be replaced by the name of the installed code.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the installation of device drawing of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reader power, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio-code of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc.) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give a hint about what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this may give tips how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, all understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and to read our first & CD; we will lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found as it is not completely free software. at least, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is there and that you have writing them (eg; by trying to copy with the Conqueror into something).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something which will probably be done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for any out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the compression code for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and what structure is used to use. as we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the internet download.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not be able to change a & CD; change once the matching settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is given to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device-drawing of your drive. if this does not work or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look inside the file / etc / fbar and an attempt with the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The carton board General settings. here is not much to do. here, an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything will be shown / typed as in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only for uncomplete information can be asked, so that you will be informed when details are missing in sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The carton CD; settings. just select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet of a freeDB machine.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD; so that it can access to the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately when you are dissatisfied with the database entry / filenames or day entries, they can easily be changed. the directory or file name will be changed with Conqueror &gt; umrename and the ID3-tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example is further to consider: if you want to manually enter the selection fields and freeDB. however, these are not used with freeDB locally in offline mode. however, these can be selected by freeDB in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected at least the first. the mode is set up on the next cardboard card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server through the Internet. how does the system know which data will get the CD? read the section about freeDB. put everything as it is in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to page freedb.org and look for a mirror server near the computers. however, this approach will function as a first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, since many firewalls are boiled the protocol 8880 standard, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the & HTTP; protocol usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to submit a & CD; data to the freeDB server will transmit. the first analogous field should be suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneous pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time at just an existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author does not know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, please click this to look at the & CD; at the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want this cross, then the path / folder can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. this can't be beneficial if only space on another drive is available. if the box is not attached, the files will not forget, if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All as input as it is on the screenshot. the command is somewhat long, under certain circumstances, something must be fed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate is on average approximately 224 to 256 kpbs. the reached compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. year. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous WAV files: with a dual-core or quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to purchase more than a WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we have just finished the basic setup of & audiocreator; terminated. this configuration is used as standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section, described how the process of reading the & CD; we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is set up on the hard drive, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described in this section, must be repeated for any out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">As we use a & CD, which is not included in freeDB, see the screen photos somewhat different from the ones for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; they will learn to manually input the & CD; instead they will learn from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done so now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only when the & CD; as audio CD; you could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers according to the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successful from the freeDB has been picked up, all tracks of the pieces are already completed and also the name of the artist and the album are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; gives, a window will be built, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the cross field for automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings) have been selected, you can manually trigger this by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get the data out of the Internet, need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-Editor - input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Type the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screenshot one. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'latest title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be typed in the input field, unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment box can be used for the individual comments inidizell per piece, the comment-box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful withdrawal of data from the freeDB the CD-editor is not empty, but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD Editors, so that you are not only satisfied with the artist's and album names (e.g. if all words with large letters begin or not...) but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist, album and titles of a piece and on only 28 characters in the commentary area. if you have ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited dirt length, at least to that which & audiocreator; maximum permits. this option is set up at the default settings; take a look at the section 'basic settings'.</seg>

<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & Konqueror; window into the & kmid; -window drop. this also works with multiple songs simultaneously.</seg>

<seg id="1633">If you want to set up an event type, select from the menu settings the entries of text events or recitals. the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. these will be played in the row. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, open the collection manager. this is where you will find the collection manager under the point.... Click there on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the required collection managers.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all songs that you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. if you add many pieces to you.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the button Add a song, with whose help you can choose the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting automatic added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add to the collection is enabled, a piece to open (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically added to the active collection.</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, in opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and integrated. this collection will then be added to the attached pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager to select the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the series according to the submenu sequence of the menu collections, the songs are played in order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be re-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the Collecting manager, or use the selection list via the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the next song, the entry next song from the menu piece or push the arrow to the right.</seg>

<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button Deleting.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter as it is when leaving & kmid; it will not be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI Map General-MIDI Events in events that synthesizer the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet, and thus always be a trumpet, if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, do not need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI Map is a text file, which saves all the necessary conversions for the play of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section that may appear as often as desired. but the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END Options... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your Map file as an email, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can be used for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, how the patches of General MIDI can be displayed on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equations is ignored. it is thought that the GM -Patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay down all notes that support this instrument (GM-patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which is similar to a gun. to do this in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (tissue output), it occupies patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is available in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch included the patch is meant by which each sound represents a different perception instrument (Drum, basin, Maracas & etc;) and not the one, in which the sound level the tongs of the always the same drum means (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how tones are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the sequence of lines is very important, as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you just need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used above all to make notes on the perch channel. check out as an example of the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to trade for example the first and second channel, make it easy in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion to a particular channel (general MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">Midi devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap will naturally continue to be defined in the file. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will be ignored that change the patch on this channel. in this case, then, patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the Persian patch on the Persian channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderratio admits to which relation to Pitch Bending events multiplied with the value n, this will be refunded with the formula * (r / 4096) and then first passed on. the value 4096 is used, so that in the map file no decimal must be no decimal).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM indicates that a keyboard, which is a pitch-out event gets higher to play with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two tones up to an octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; walking around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. this can be found in the menu under Settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole series of claviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on these claviatures see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the Kanalview to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can choose an instrument, lights the button not more green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (up to now) two different views to indicate the played notes. view the View menu under the point of Kanalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the pace, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can compel anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without Awe support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you have to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection but I don't want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree, therefore supports & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror; select all the files, and drag them onto the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Previously, you necessarily activate the setting automatic added to the collection. otherwise the files are added to temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow button on the left of the Tempo- LCD, to slow down the playback. to restore the standard speed you can double-click on the LCD double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & Konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this way I have to play a MIDI file (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only in the & Konqueror; window change and the desired file into the window of & kmid; pull.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file fast, without adding them to a collection, turn the setting automatic add to the collection and the new one; file will add to temporary collection added to open files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.D. first you only want to play the first file. so imagine the setting automatic added to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animates me that, further to & mid; to program.</seg>

<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you want a question, a mistake or an idea for an extension of & kmid; have, or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arravel .es</seg>

<seg id="1703">A soundcard. I recommend you a good soundcard or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same as you use a FM device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you have no sound card, you will have to compile a sound card; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you would have a sound card, except that you can of course no music.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help, please check the page The KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the playlist. and finally there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the menu bookmarks but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which will be played after each other, so you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hierarchy. if you have an entry, his group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the added entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permant playlist can also be changed by direct editors of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & .kde / share / kmplayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. simply click on a name of a category Clicks to choose from the menu view and next editing mode. by the clientment of a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select from the menu the same with playlist, and select either the editing mode, or another category is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the working mode is left, or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starters and ending can be disabled by editing of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc and changing from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option on '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & kmplayer: will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation at starters does not need to be short, it will automatically be terminated by opening another source. this would be interfering at the end-animation but the user can end the application for a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; verbs; & lt; / / / home / koos / mum.gif "; / smilds; & lt; / smilds; & lt; / smilds; are in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & kmplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider on the configuration of Mplayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer. here, the path can be adjusted from the Mplayer and the intermediate storage size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this playback in the Configuration dialog of & kmplayer. everything must be configured by manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayc, just as the setting of the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played within & kmplayer; it can even be inserted in the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & kmplayer can reproduce the 'flash' in HTML pages, the & kmplayer has to be set as a service provider for the MIME-Type, / x-Shockwave flash in the setup dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is available in a consoles, and search error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. the starting process is called knpplayer. if there is no error, the backend issue is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">This is always taken a given backend for a specific MIME type (of course only if this was also determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayguc. for example, phonon all ogg files will be reformed:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards, either using a player or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be viewed, the scanner needs to be used and the TV channels can be configured, or configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To Configuration of the VDR (Video Personal Rekorder) settings in kmplayer is the dialog under the settings below - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected by which one is selected (e.g., PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support from kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only functions working). this is also necessary only on the first screen (: 0.0). this is also necessary for the XFree86 server in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMplayers for the sources different names. at the time of the emergence of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exiting source, source code, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are you hints as I can do my CDROM drive quieter if I play from him (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -e 8 / dev / CDROM is used as user root after joining the device. thereby, it is absolutely certain that / dev / CDROM is on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. under Unix-like systems will probably be traced to the package & texlive; or tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution should be included. for installation, documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD can be used.</seg>

<seg id="1745">This manual is available for everyone - regardless of the experience with & latex;, & cheque; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users must hardly read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account. however, the support for this project or its documentation is needed, the contact with the web site should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Step questions or when compiling by & kile; on or will be desired, this should be addressed at the mailing list-devel-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>

<seg id="1752">Just as other distinctive languages includes & latex; an introduction with which the general features such as paper format, side-numbered and text grind with the text. the introduction includes at least the command\\ 'class, the causal starts with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\\ by {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The quick entry assistant of & kile; is a true function for the quick creation of a document in & kile; the choice of assistants (MenÃ ¼ ¼) offers some possibilities for the preparation of the document. it can also be made some of the settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Documentation: this will be the type of the document displayed: articles (article), book [report], report [report], report [report], articles (DIN) [Sreprt], book (DIN) [Sareprt], projector [Prospans] or custom.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Code: this is hereby to be used the string coding of the system. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as standard. if the UTF-8x should be used (for proper processing of latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most used additional packages for latex; for the integration they are only about in the cross field.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Articles (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations).</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users have now to worry about it. only a brief description of the functions and further information can be given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just as other source code editors - the emergence of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). by doing so, it is possible to notice any mathematical environment. however, you may notice it by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you through the amount of time and out of the output.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic processing of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {Command}) of & kile; automatically a blank line (for entering the text), and the related line to the lockers of the instruction is created (e.g.\\\ by {Command}). this function can be disabled in the menu set; set up... LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; inherited the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the most common and substitched element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structuring, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse-click on the one.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful, jumps & kile; through a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in the latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF format type of & tex; or latex; there are many tools to view, conversion and printing of DVI; files for various systems and tannins.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the rack, the elements of the DVI; file connected with the editor is the exact opposite section. once on a section in the latex; source code has been clicked, becomes the corresponding location in the DVI; the viewer was sponsored.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used in working with multiple files. using a master document the work with other included .tex files is simplified. when using a project a project-wide master document can be set to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Rapid building: the latex-code is compiled and the result will be automatically displayed (if no errors in source code are available).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File alert: in this mode, the DVI; -file to be ripped, and there is no call from & eyepiece; after the rapid building.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the editing toolbar, the three large sections of the choice should be noted. the selection fields have been designed for the fast layout of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The subverable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field More is for entries of articles such as tags, fox, notes, or references. the options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, an image or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (selection of a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using citation, a selection list will be displayed with literary ones. for the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors necessary. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & b; the & bibtex; files can be written also in & kile; from hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The final selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for determining the font size. it can be specified the font for the main text, the fox, notes etc. there are the following fonts to cover:</seg>
<seg id="1775">In the call of & kile; two choices are available for sale: 1. the wizards for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and set up settings. 2. the document can be written from reason to hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 's class contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] puts the font. the font does not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is the use of the MenÃ s Tree or the Knopfs Schnellconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The code must be stored before compiling. & kile, the storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Thanks to the compiling of the document, should be searched for the errors. when using rapid construction should & eyepiece should be started. if this is not the case, should also be considered the log-proof.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document. for example, a report with the font size 12 creates and only a few pieces should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ by {environment}. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ by} environment}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The devices are merely within the area (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ by {environment}). there is no complying (number) for those who work in an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to obtain the readability and usability of the document. for example, certain fonts, fat pressure, curant pressure, submissions, etc. added either by the command\\ by order or automatically at the end of the surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {empirih}: this command is for the course of course and is long until he is closed with a\\\ {empirih} or another environment. a single word in a proposition can be represented with\\ empirih {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ ': created a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\' {rate} and ends with\\ by {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source text with the latex; indicative language was represented, now follows a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once the assistant has entered a bit of text, some adjustments should be accomplished for the better legibility of the document. therefore, at least one quotation, a few places in fat and short-pressure and a poem can come to the application to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, using editor View, or Ctrl may be back to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted into a & postscript; / PDF file will be converted. just try out and fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an active file format (engl. D e V ice I ns.). these files are created by & tex; or latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi version such as printer, & PostScript; / PDF -Umwandler or computer screen.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document (see). by clicking on DVI, the document can be printed by file Drucken (in the viewer) (provided the printer is correct).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar is the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; -file from the latex; source code has been created, the conversion can begin in random other formats using the toolbar in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The curtains for the direct jump from the editor for the related position within the DVI; -file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; for this purpose only modern settings have to set up the settings... tools building will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To locate the pros, the mouse-cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and is evacuated on prelocalities. the jump to the corresponding location in the DVI; the viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document of & kile; available and set on the corresponding line.</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should the use of rapid construction of the & DVI; spectator does not exist, can be a mistake. should an error appear, this will be shown in the log file or in the news window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file is the error source in the source code. in the editor you can always see the line earlier, in which the error appears. to view the faulty line, must be clicked on the error in the log-on and & kile; jump to the faulty line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the template for the document. the options listed are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">If you choose from empty document a document can be written either from scratch or the wizard to fast creation of a new document. more information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Regular users of latex; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents. templates, can be saved in & kile; created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, you need to create an existing & tex; - / latex; file geffnet or a new file will be created. & Clile; can create a new template using any existing document and selection of file template.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in settings in settings... settings General will be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering documents. typically, it will be used as the following files:\\ 'class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the entry into the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps were taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document may then be the template's own template instead of default.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; used as an internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor for programmers with the ability of reading and emergence of many different types of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for you can be made directly from & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Kate; and his opportunities to know should be drawn to Kate's manual. users of & kile; could start there directly with reading the chapter of works with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which may be called the Menja help LaTeX reference. you can find an exceptional description of almost all commands, which can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with paved Ctrl button to cover the & tex; meaning that this way will be used when clicking on\\ par\\\\\\ 's only\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with penetrated linker, the text is automatically copied into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow buttons, you can get parts of the source code in the editing pane.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the ability to browse the most different types of swelling and this highlight. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Lots of assistants may have their own jumping marks. these are a separate type of bookmarks within the text. the menu entry is highlighted the jump to the most or last springboard. thereby, this jumping stamp is highlighted, so that it is automatically yellow at the first input of a sign.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; important functions have been added in & kile; important functions for writing a & latex; swelling items have been added. & latex; bending always many environments and groups and therefore submerged. & latex; special commands to their selection. by editing, the following commands are included:</seg>
<seg id="1817">For a complete paragraph includes a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain on both sides a blank line). this extended meaning is not meant by a text with all text lines (as in other text editor). the only exploiting thing in & kile; the only exploiting thing in & kile; is that the only exploiting thing are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">According to the current Cursorposition, this selection also has an extended importance, since this command also latex; commands with an area-shaped (*) and an extra star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For finishing a part of the document may be removed from this first and by wires the button def. & Kate; offers the keyboard shortcut ctrl; K with the entire line is removed. & kile; provides with its own commands to contain a faster result. under editing, the following commands contain:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removed a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is contained in the description of editing paragraph (in paragraph).</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarifies that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile offers additional commands under editing environment for a profitable simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, for the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the front door.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, at the end of the current environment, no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front or within the instruction\\ 'begin {surroundings}, the end of the surrounding area is préed (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many spared ambient commands may be quickly lost. this command slept quickly the last environment, so the vanized ambient structure is not broken.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...} are a few important commands that correspond to those made of editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command becomes the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the welded clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command is sponsored by the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the rolling clamp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor from or behind the welded clamp of a & tex; group # is located at the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many intertwisted groups-brackets can quickly be lost as soon as possible. this command slept quickly the last group, so that the snowed structure of the & tex; groups are not broken.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple instructions are used as a device. for the purpose of purpose is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple anesthetic signs is used. moreover, the sign" for two simple anesthetic signs is used. also, the sign "for two simple application marks is used. & kile; knows this case and for two slept-up characters for latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of double results can be set up under settings Kile... LaTeX - and they are exhausted.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to use specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and therefore German or French characteristics. there are also many more languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">In the wiring of Shift; input button, an intelligent line of line. if the current position is located within a list of lists (e.g. enumerates or itemize), for example, not only a line breakup but also the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Inside a tables environment, you can spend the current line with\\\\ with an adjoining toe nails.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to put pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments to undermines. these can be found under settings; set up... LaTeX to be added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users complain the columns in tables, environments and all the Et characters (amp;) each other with each other. while this tabulator is not included; after the most common tabulator in the following line. although this tabulator is not the case, for some intermediate space for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already a good source code has been completed; in order to have special commands (usually for & latex;) are still extended. there are three different modes implemented. these are three depending on the need, and the other two are for automatic transmission. all these modes can be set up to different ways of working under settings.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment with the command\\ 'begin {environment} is set & kile; automatically the command\\ by {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">While wiring the RÃ ¼ ck button, the last letter of the entry is removed and is therefore the complete list. on the other hand, the list can be reduced by entering another letter too.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions can be noted, so that a simple jump to these positions by means of editing marks NÃ ¶ ffest ski stamp is possible and the well-known parameters can be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under settings, set up... kile; objectionable settings can be made to these lists. there may be different WÃ s lists for & tex; - and latex; commands, as well as wine orders of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is ready for completion of environments. it's always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of contraception mode will have a rough list with ambient light. on the other hand, the environments will often be used that & kile; a special mode for the completion of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the fuller mode of editing, the menu is automatically frozen, the command is automatically frozen out of the environment and it appears\\ begin {. after that the environment can be completed and by wiring the entry button are terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is accomplished, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; recognizes that it is a lists of environment, even a first\\ item command will be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings; set up... kile; objectionable settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the whistling list of the complete mode for mantex; - and latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; underestimated user-defined lists of abbreviations, which can immediately set up using settings. the lists can be set up under settings. as an example of an absorption list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX contain.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is typed and the word convertible mode is introduced to the volume of editing, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Rough whales are not helpful for automatic transmission. however, it has been found that many WÃ ¶ rter in a document are written more than once. this offers & kile; the completion for all already written hands.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set in the MenÃ ¼ inch settings... Kile Verfuller. here, the swelling value can be set for the display of the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The contraception files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / pile / complete / mode / complete / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode / mode version), Dictionary (WÃ rterbook) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialog graphics designed the introduction of graphics as simple as possible. to complete the basis of the basics of the graphics should be the sections and looked at.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as well known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for downloading and new appings of pages. will the PDF output can be arranged with a few & PostScript; tools are new arranged and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To watch the outcome of the work, it must be compiled in the source code. all the building tools are grouped in the menu creation, creating converting and creating view summarized.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the swelling of the viewer, like & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be the keyboard number; 2 used, by Alt; 4 the DVI; -file converted into a PS file and using Alt; 5 the PS file will be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command above, there is usually called a viewer after the compiling. should not be used a one-connected viewer, so every time will be a new window.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be introduced to the project New Project.... the following information is asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the filename -window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr -project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows the outlet of ECMAScript -code. the scripts can be managed scripts in the sencreed Leiste.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet endless, and can be added in further versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First of all must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods have:</seg>
<seg id="1862">Latex; is a quite small system which can be extended in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of supplement packages. & kile; offers a lot of different aid to underlining the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texlive; are supplied with many documents. in this include a documentation for the contained packages and a further & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete refernz for & tex; and then eâ ll not only be described by a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete manual for a particular formatting. since it is a very large document, it is divided into & kile; divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the amount of documents using the & tetex; / texlive; delivered, the Finder of the correct document is not always easy. as an appropriate help offers & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk that includes a database with all to & kile; delivered documents and here for a graphic top.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the plus advantage is the search for parcel names or percussions. by & kile, then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">A double-click with the mouse or the space of space-taste the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& kile; is a quelloffener and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; -source code, which can be sold on all systems with installed & colon; - and Unix systems, which can also be sold on & Mac; also on & Mac; with installed OS X-X.</seg>

<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that in a blackout or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as storing the file. even if not stored documents, a backup is regularly created, according to the specified time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing pane or a private view (or the documentation in a cardboard), which makes it possible to watch the documentation, the preview and the source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods can take a script from & quantaplus; on the default entry. in the selection field input can be determined what to send to the standard input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executing application can be redirected. there are two types of issue: normal output written to the standard error. it can be specified, which is to be done with the text written on the default issue, by the value the selection field will be set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the market-up language, it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups. in the case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you have to add and configure actions. select Settings promotions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. pressing the New Action Knopfes at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add them to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the day attributes has and you plan their use, activate the dialog box if available, so that an input in the operation of the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is it a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; use of the & KMenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used by default 32x32 pixels, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you notice what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a starter button as a symbol. through the use of green (green is usually interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled a message to the user that clicking on this symbol is a & lt; start-up in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After the creation of the symbol it still needs to be connected with the action. this happens via the menu with attitudes actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Appendix button and set them with other tags, so there is still which indicates, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some usual & quantaplus; functions to toolbar, or it should be allocated to a better overview by some Trenner in several groups. open the toolbar to adjust dialog using settings. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (very left above) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, it is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Conqueror preview. I will select it and add to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how separators support the group. someone who doesn't know my toolbar, could believe that the & Konqueror; -button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by proxy of all symbols, to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after new XML does not exist, it will be used imregular folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your & descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded (s) if a file is opened by the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the opportunity to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check out in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc. language. then you have to create the docrc file. the first part we will leave you, the second we treat it here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc 1 = path, relative to this file, for example php42 / # elements in the main index = Section1.2.1 = Section1.2.1 = Section1.2.1 = Section1.1.0 = Section1.html, 2 = volume 2.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag2.html 3 = tag2.html 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you see now in the & PHP; documentation such:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc 1 = php42 / # top level: top element = PHP 4.2 Interface Getting Started = Introduction = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Notice the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the chess telephones (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table directory is referenced directly to a file (and more consequent at the top of the building view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but pay attention to & & lt; signs. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus, which are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file which is intended for the design of the context-sensitive assistance. for example, when writing a & PHP; H for context-help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separated separated context elements, which should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc just after $HOME / .kde / p / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / or / quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as stated in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are confident that these are good and worth it, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation has been used to the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web developer platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the remotest resources (DTEP packages, workflows with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an e-mail send menu entry, such as DTD DTD-package (DTEP) with email, in the context menu of files and folders in templates, and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can be reviewed and only available when our team needs them to be correct and usefull for publication. to signalize the resources, which ensures a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key (the Passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can request a out. in dialogue New resource you have to pass out the input fields (URL preview can stay empty) and with clicking on OK the uploading will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The uploading can upload from the menus DTD DTD-packet (DTEP), tooling toolbar, and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, even before installation, investigating & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signal. in case of problems, it can be broken down. if the integrity are given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the statement of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML languages, which is currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, it can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files in day XML format could be necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD shop and Converting of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. after that, the following dialogue appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / p / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the string that is within! DOCTYPE tag, such as HTML Public / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loodd should appear</seg>
<seg id="2080">Setting the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; -Editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and get full benefit from & quantaplus; so that chapter needs to be familiar with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to bring them precisely these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefits.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. by workflows through actions it is all that is used as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators different workflows, actions and patterns in the global tree that will be available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are custom pattern and workflows. local elements are stored in the user directory, so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be everything from & CSS; patterns to workflows with special promotions especially for the files of a particular project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all the elements are stored in the folder of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project emöglicht.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editing window, the building views, the Karteireites with information and the toolbar. please suggest you in, and for further information about these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the cardboard button with the right mouse button to reload a text menu with the current doctrine, like close the current, other or all cartels, reload, delete or load uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editorques lead to a further context menu regarding the revised document content, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing of the mouse-cursor, help to the word under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, if the string is called under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorfensters are the toolbar of the Editors. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of workflows will be shown. in the course of further development of & quantaplus, the toolbar will be adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of workflows is really easy. if you want to insert it into your document, then click on the icon that represents the day. now, they can insert the data for this just added day. if they want to insert one day, which has multiple attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information on & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and wander through. in the presentation with Karteireites stand for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation Baumanviews.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project using right mouse-click. actions such as add, removal, uploading or deleting the files from memory medium can be done with the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. there are all options open.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what connection they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus; the category is always available, local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates are only usable in the project. more to templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking on the right mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. via the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send with e-mail.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links to an element the cursor is set in the document on the position of the element. through right-clicking of an element it opens up a list of commands with regard to navigation and refresher tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, manic attributes and namespaces can be changed. this allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation for developing web-technology for your development. you can download pre-paced documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project may be added to project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two carton-rated at the bottom of the window, can be reached via the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This carton shows information about each in Quanta current script. thus, for example, the DTD of the current document used and all changes to DTD are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This box rider shows all errors in the market-up of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; workflows are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the Chocolon of the toolbar is the opportunity to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantaplus; sends out the toolbar as the kommiered Tar archive over & kmail; if they get a toolbar in an e-mail, they can secure it in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable when you want to adjust the place of & quantaplus, files on your system. for this, autoconf has given a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script. to give a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and here do not run.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems when starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before their bin folder. the same is true for & Qt.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web-development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; was optimized for rapid Web-development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor to create, the developers of & quantaplus, began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup languages would? well, this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limits, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tools. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then there should be & quantaplus; for this, the appropriate & IDE mode.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim has to be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; development community is based. & quantaplus; follow, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop? thanks to the & kde; rumst is not only this all possible, but allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand how they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers the usage of an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can increase productivity almost every task. through the program compresses they can have to expand & quantaplus; expand, without remembering a scripting language. (more about that they find in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& quanta; plus; is a webdevelopement environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for rapid development development and has been expanded rapidly to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / quanta (either this URL in & Konqueror; input, or khelpcenter help: / quanta perform).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& quanta; is currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file, which is not taken out, whereby the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. should they try to store the selected file / text outside of the local / project template, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts when inserting out the clipboard there special characters to the & HTML; check-up, so that it is displayed correctly and not to be misunderstood by the browser as a formatting system.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converted the text from the clipboard in & URL; check which is the correct way to inserting special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. first and foremost to inserting & URL; s in the anchor day is used.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. that allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift; taste.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. that's very helpful if your & PHP; script error messages exist!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a type of grep or sed with GUI and predefined phrases to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the news window or not. that's the window in which you see the display of scripts and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Initial and turning of the problem at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you switch to the structural tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolspold left of the main window. this column allows you to put bookmarks with a mouse-click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries of previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped after the filenames of other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the file turn .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied into the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory to new files that could be there. that allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add it to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project managed. in Chapter & quantaplus; projects can be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in Project You / toolbar and are available only in this menu if you have assigned it to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this will only create the name. actions need to set up your name. actions are stored about workflows, store and you will be asked by asking if you want to store the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Remove a toolbar from the field of view. that deletes them not from the disk. if you don't yet have stored the toolbar, you are asked if you would like to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team, so that the toolbar in the next publication is available). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbar to the main server, where anyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the & quantaplus; own description.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / strips of the entities from the & DTD; is sensible if the entities are from the & DTEP; should be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this global one is not present and a typeat in the global KDE folder is not present, fails to shop.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently charged toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day setup dialog, if there is one. this entry is always present in the menu tags, followed by & DTD; -specific submenu.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent inserting of tags. intelligent, this means only using (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent objections means that & quantaplus; the inserting using toolbar is denied if this day is contradicting the rules this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the above menu items. click on the button. click on a activated plug-ins deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntaxonomical mode for the current file. the list of available training schemata depends on derkate; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between the different types of user interface. through some limitations in the KDE libraries, it can sometimes need time or unbeautiful graphics. recommended is the card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the display in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu features an entry for every open subwindow. with the selection of a trader, the appropriate subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Displays the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog influenced any application that use the KHTML Part, including the & Konqueror; Webbrowser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behaviour of the editing pane. in the documentation of & Kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears, in which you delete entries from the toolbar or which can add or change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should produce a help in accordance with the mouse environment, but it is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high-quality product that is freely available and free, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled best from top to bottom, as after filling the project called the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift; F7 Project project properties can be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to include, for example foo. when entering the name file, file is automatically filled.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with the extension of webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can access the server's server, to which you want to access, one, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exemp.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">Lets this field empty, the default settings of the chosen log can be used. depending on the setup of the remote host, an adaptation could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder in which the toolbar is stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbar. if a shared collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of standards.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem into the project. it can be selected multiple files or whole folder.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. with serverside script (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Accused, if files, which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project, are to be involved. if a project is started from scratch, not anhaken.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option will display all of the files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of your thinner.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files through folders or, using the tick, clamps out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The final screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can upload automatically in the menu with project properties in the menu window profiles, or using the shortcut shift; F7 can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible), which are reignored in project-related operations such as the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to above, also files that are listed in .cvsignor are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is charged at opening the project. in may more be read about project insights.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is found in. the Debugger Plugin can be adjusted with the button Options. in case the bug fixes is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles uploaded high-profile profiles (see in) are set, as well as the display of a building view for the contents of the server for each profile, showing a separate building view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the subwindow event configuration, you can switch event actions and add these actions to change or delete. event actions will be executed when a previously defined event occurs, such as the sickle of a file. see in the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior cannot currently affect.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project developers gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files in the current project can be managed.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave just as well, however, the entries are missing and Open with... in the right button of the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the site of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only more one profile is present, the button is lowered to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and be forgotten by programmer. this possibility is useful when common uploading files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the record is not available in question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-profile profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded onto different servers. editing or creating a profile will be displayed this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server that should be copied to the files. either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and NFS.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual Port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety wave, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it according to your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and toolbar. it can be published in a project many views, i.e. by simply changing the view, different files and workflows can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored or deleted in the menu Project or the Project-toolbar, accessible or deleted via settings of toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this helps not only boost productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; on its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, workflows in & quantaplus; best mentioned above the menu toolbar. use and add-in. adding workflows will be dealt with in the section "Add of workflows."</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on this can either be set up using the text menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which new action, a new toolbar can remove, rename or workflows, what can be stated in the dialog, where actions on this or other toolbar may be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Through the call of the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, in addition the entries are removed and action to be processed, the self-explanatory are.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings toolbar... and set up attitudes actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are included in essential documentation, code buckles and files to combine. & quantaplus; used templates, basically like a common file system with expansive organisation and interfaces. you can copy, move or any existing directory in the padstack. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you are preparing for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions attached at the beginning of each template.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binar is all that is not purer text. it can be included any file except text, so images, & PDF; binaries are usually inserted in documents using shortcuts (e.g. images with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available under global templates. further information on the Templates is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, special rumst for the purpose and organises the work in a appropriate way to efficiently be efficient. some examples can be found in the collagen tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text range is always included in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete quantity system on Javascript or Perl basis. some examples are found in the prefix tree under global templates. see for more information on the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole sites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a compress tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure by choice (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File To save as a template.</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that happened, you notice that (even if it was saved as a project template), the template is not visible in the projecycle. check in the pre-tree under projections.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file to store your choice as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be used with pulling and shutdown on the building style templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binaries is simple: to copy the file only into a subfolder-folder. it can be used to use all file administration functions, such as pulling and derivative or insertion over the file tree of conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can select in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, the project folder will be secured, but of course it can be stored as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Projections allow a very target-oriented programming language. you can insert headlines and footlines or dynamically with & PHP; design, paste files or connect with them. in addition, one can keep in mind some things in the use of templates in projects very profound.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The basic structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files presented in the $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / templates / p / quanta / templates / quanta / templates / quanta / templates / quanta / templates / quanta / templates / temanta / templates / quanta / templates / etc / quanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates / temanta / templates /</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behaviour of a folder in the template, click on the folder and select in the context menu features. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is abelled as soon as Elterous attributes expired.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the prescriptions. if a stem folder would be so adjusted, unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like Text-Baustein. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a stem folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allowed or set up text for templates in this folder. this could be general headlines or footlines for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a folder with special headlines, footer lines, and can equip each presentation with the matching headlines.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a right mouse menu (to indicate the right mouse button) about a complete command of buttons for the Add of folders or copying and insert templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; - Editor and VPL; the first mode will replace the source Editor through the VPL; Editor and the second window will divide the editor window into two parts: the source Editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch on if necessary for the source code Editor, in which the changes carried out in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document, which & PHP; contains a small green symbol the Vohandion of & PHP; -source code. it is not possible to edit this directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; there is no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that simultaneously the changes in the source Editor and the VPL; editor will be visible in the source Editor and in the VPL; editor will be activated, this mode is already active, the keyboard shift from one window to another, whereby the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation gap between the VPL; Editor and the source Editor is adjustable to settings Quanta settings.... After choosing VPL; you can select between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in principle the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to time. basically, the recommendation applies: a small gap for quick calculator and a large range for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor will also be called upon as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor will also be called the reduction of the hanging code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. headwords for Internet searchengines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click on the list enables the change of content, e.g. key words on the column names and keyword keywords keyword on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change on the list is possible just as with the meta-elements possible. editing of CSS-rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing on the file button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is like in a text processing, due to the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor operates as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of regress or removal.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar, as in the source editor. it is to be noted that the inserting of tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text, each other embraced anchor tag should be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some workflows such as the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; work in this release must use the tables or lists workflows.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools for comparisons. so why & Do 3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated because one of the contributors had done many changes and simultaneously in many places the objection had been corrected. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts when connecting.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly had changed within these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the objection had changed. that's how these changes were a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & sounded 3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, plenty of more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare fast text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it to one of the previous window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function made a lot of work was the same and assembling of folders. this function turned to & diffuse 3; nearly into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way together is fully supported. this is useful when two people are working independently of a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously shows the result expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three quell files in the process:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& sounded 3; helps you also at the same and assemble complete folder. this screenshot shows & kicks 3; with the folder-together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& sounded 3; displays the exact differences and serve in addition to the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often have to check Kode, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are visible. if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no hassle any more, if Yemen and the objection changes.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is identical, and the other differs in a line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all the files have the same name, but in different folders, you can make the tipparable work immediately by using only the filename of the first file completely. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 -o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows manual input of filenames, the selection over the file browser (file...) or selecting a last updated file from the list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you don't have the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is conducted.</seg>
<seg id="2295">About the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or assembling of folders. if for A file is selected, for B and C, a folder, then used & diffuse 3; the filename from A to the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If we merge together, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately. you can take this step later on saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with settings. here you can specify options before starting with the comparisons / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & # 3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts then immediately. in opening dialog, you need to select no files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use goat and drop: drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What idea is behind it? sometimes, a file contains e.g. several similar functions. if you want to find out how much these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to upload two appropriate files to load them in & kdiff3; download and then compare it. now you can copy the relevant sections simply, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't drag nothing out & diffuse 3; only the traption of text in a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and derivative of text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such cases, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window, the info-line of the source window contains the signs A, B or C, the filenames and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse a while on the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed over the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in color, which file differs. if both files differ, the predominant color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (merge) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the summarizing column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the processor and in few, rare items.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line which separates the contraction column of the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line change is activated, the line is dotted to broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparative windows) also has a info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [change] when you have finished the result. usually, it contains by automatic merge already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, save is deactivated!!! (use the buttons, to nightly solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparisons windows are used, each difference can also be solved at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed. (thus, a jump of position in the windows is displayed, where the beginning of the group will otherwise not be visible.) This group will then highlighted the paint background color for current area and each one on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes the automatic merge or by manual editing no more line will be left in the group; then there is only a place holder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a markings that you might have to copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; executable; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you select the sources the options ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments are activated, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This navigates mainly with the mouse drives and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrows on the left, end, end, shrg-beginning and shrg end, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the crossing column beside the vertical picture bar can also be used for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Augmentation window you can also use the other buttons for editing. using the inserting button you can switch between inserting and transwritable mode. (pre-set is the insertion mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summarize columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the section and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / former difference (Ctrl-down / Ctrl image) or to the next / previous conflict (Strasbourg image) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl image) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore, it must be resolved between soldered and unresolved conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the markings to the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (CtrC or Ctrl insertion). if this is enabled, whatever you select, automatically copied into the clipboard and install the manual Koper. be careful with this option but you could see the content of the clipboard accidentally.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Row will be saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix-versions use a row sign\, and Win32-based systems use car back\\ r\\\\\\. Kdecker 3 keeps the line-end of the source files, therefore you should use & box 3; also not using binder files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the most recently used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start. (menu inclusion - &gt; Kdecker 3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also provides writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use it.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are shown in short script. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in its pure form, but would be shown. on these systems the button presets will automatically set an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When activated, when this option is activated, when selecting the tabulator button, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a tabulator sign is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When entering or return, the entry of the preceding line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When activated, each selection will automatically copy into the clipboard. manually copy the manual into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In the comparisons of files you have tried & diffuse 3; first to be all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares every line. in this step white characters will not be ignored. also, the white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a wagon look '\\ r' and a row slide '\' at the end of a line, others can only save a row sign-page comparison, but then you could use files with different sizes on the page-to-page comparison, but then you could be treated differently. while joining together, this option must be disabled. in the default, this option is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the default setting, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters are ignored ('0' - '9', '.' - '). in the result the differences are nevertheless shown, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In the default setting, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In the Automatically reviewing mode, this attitude determines how long the outcome of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the chosen file as a source. (pre-set manual selections.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need to use it from time to time, then use the automatic selection also in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments are activated.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning of folders and thoroughing a compilation. look for details on documentation for the directory comparison and compilation.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, then the original version is appenix .orig. if such a backupfile with the Suffix .orig exists, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adapting to the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current program. you must end and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & sounded 3; not available because the language is set aside over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately. if you activate this option, it is used for all entries the upper adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for encoding appears a short notice of what the local coding is. (this can not be changed here and has purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreting. since the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only be used with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can set the coding of the output of subcutters.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this in order to suppress heralizations of changes in white characters in the text or overview. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore or ignoring C / C + + comments are activated.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all the differences between two of three files are displayed. however, you might just want to see the differences between two of three files. according to selecting A & lt; s; B, A & lt; -s; C or B & lt; -section; C is displayed next to the normal nor a second crossing column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just skip the less important windows. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparison side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window-menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together. a simple click starts the compilation and used the filenames of the last source file as a registered name for the output file. (if this function is used to collapse) then the name of the most recently used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it will be handed over to this external command. in & # 3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly your demands. you can use this function e.g. to cut disruptive parts or to correct the retrofit.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is given first to this external command. if also a regular pre-editing command is indicated (see above), then the output of the command will only be used at Zeilder. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly your needs. each input line needs to have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users would not want to program that. the good news is however, that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this Pre-editor for Zeilder to convert the input into large letters: sed 's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\' s) refers to the found text in the first clone string.\\ U converts the found text in large letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems are using the same pattern as a keyword (info: / CVS / keyword\\ _ BAR _ header\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you like this regular expressions, even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdecker 3. but it is good as an example of a further processing tool for Zeilds straight. sed 's / [0123456789.-] / / g' Everyone sign between '[' and ']' is a hit, and each other is replaced by nothing, so quasi.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several compositions at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' use to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl-p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switch. however, for perl some details are different. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only (and) without the lead "\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal process processor will be kept for viewing and compiling. further operations only change the data that the Zeilythmus can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when you use a normal pre-processor, the Zeilab processor sees the output of the normal process processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The processor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can not accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Many times you need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & ks.3; complete folder recursively compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object; you can adjust the proposal before the start</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can it simulate and displays the simulated changes, without having to carry out</seg>
<seg id="2364">... runs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparisons and merge individual files very similar. you just need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no target folder has been specified, use & diffuse 3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not to merge the composite, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will receive a small news window of current progress. if you break the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed, which were compared to that.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is completed, displays & diffuse 3; a list window with the results on the left-hand side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and each folder that has been found during the scan will be shown here in a tree. you can choose an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually combined together. you can double up a folder by clicking on the + / - clicking on the object, or use the arrow buttons on the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories and use all subdirectories with which you can upload all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you click a file, the file will start automatically and it appears to be a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A) again. these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folder, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details window to the selected object. in such cases, the merger action can not be automatically chosen. if that is started together, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical contracts, the color is also identical, although the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their whole content is identical. then also folder the same color. at folders, the age is insignificant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a blatched again, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later when it is old, red is made.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target, if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): errors: conflicting data types. as long as such faulty objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for synchronisation is active if only two folder and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then choose & kiss 3; the necessary action, so that both folder are identical. if necessary for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical are: merge together, and save the result into both folders. (the user sees as the visible filenames for the output file only B; directly after the merge copied & glue 3; B after A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and selecting the new file instead of joining together (unsure) then the exact date will appear, but the date is identical. if the files are different, but the date is identical. if such bugs have not been eliminated, the folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While joining together, a file will be processed after another. you state status column shows up, and according to other reports, when something unexpectedly appeared, you should make a final review and check whether the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setting dialog box the file comparative method is selected, Kame 3 further columns will display. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflicts will only be displayed when three folders compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the joining together (also in all subfolders), you can bring it together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified any target folder, then it is used in three-folder mode C as the target used to merge in the two-folder B as the target and used in synchronisation A and / or B as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have chosen a target folder, please check if all entries are displayed in the folder structure, also in the folder structure. there are some options through which certain entries might be skipped. check out these options to avoid unadorable surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all the entries: choose directories and continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcuts). to run only the current entry: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If the conflicting data still exist, a message appears to exist on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialogue window will appear with the options passing, simulate and break.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select simulate if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes are made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& sounded 3; then leads certain actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is needed (merge a single file), then a composite window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select again directories / continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, a corresponding dialog appears. then, it's running & diffuse 3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & diffuse 3; on a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you'll see some error messages that will help you to jump the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select a different action for entry or solve the problem in a different way before joining together.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been performed individually, you notice & diffuse 3; these entries (in the current session) and results in later all entries. even if this has been compiled or not saved, these entries are considered to be done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be assembled again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & sounded 3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory composition with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are shown in the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; separate space holder: '*' and '?'. (for example * .cpp; * .h). the default folder must not correspond to that pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be inserted more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree. it can be inserted more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separator: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .cvsignore file. (see at info: / CVS / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems files have an inheritance -attribute. in other filesystems, a file is marked as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is downlighted in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folder and rerecursively searched. (note that a link to a folder that will contain a link to yourself would result in an end loop and dediff3; crashes down.) This option is switched in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistics columns. (the number of soldered, unsolved, non-white and white conflict.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (insert an appropriate anti-pattern)</seg>
<seg id="2409">When you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the amendment date and the file size. however, this speed costs does not cost you a certain level of safety. please use caution. this option is used in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">It does not mean a real comparison. the files are considered to be identical if they are equally big. this can be useful for example when copying the amendment date. please use with caution. this option is used in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates synchronize mode when two folders are compared and no target folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions are selected, so that the two files are identical. also, the results of the composite files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered uncertain as it is provided that the other file is not also changed. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted, then the original version is renamed and gets deleted. if an old backup file with .orig -extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal composite of individual files, not just the composite folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder-composite view remains visible at the currency; you can move the window partial with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can switch the window into window window in the window menu and switch from switching between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply using double-clicking. however, there is a single file to merge directly without the folder menu. once you save the result, the status will be set to be done and the file will not merge once you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status will be lost if you read the directory again: list menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. Kdiff3 uses this for saving files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a zipped archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax, as local files and folders. a few things should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. included. that is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masks. (# - &gt;% 23, blank spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the filesystem on the server, sometimes through the protocol-used protocol. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link is shown to a file or folder. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no possibility to edit privileges or modification date. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original. (note the option confidential the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose-purpose is currently as differences-viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop starts first always the built-in differences viewer. to launch Kdiff3, press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In Kungs3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually required & sounded 3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a sound file in the Unified format. then, the input file is a patch file in the Unix file. at least one of the two files must exist. then, starts & kiss 3; the program patch will begin to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdecker 3Part. also, this doesn't work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kills 3; as part is executed, it only supports the same of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that's together or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the folder mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (now Heist is compact) there are already. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can be combined like the program diffuse 3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL-programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or go to this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be notified to the correct prefix. in the default configuration settings in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). you can find more information about this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters are different, these lines will be treated as identical; if however, only a non-white character is different, the line will be treated as not identical. IF similar lines of next to each other, this amazis is the purpose this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking the source code and select the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is easily saved as text file and it is much effort to design extra files that could save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can recover a certain version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to process larger amounts of text should be used to use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text suddenly flushed; no src lineup; and the text does not allow himself to delete. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& sounded 3; used already many colors to highlight the differences. even more heart would be confusing and lacking the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & diffuse 3; you need & kde; 3.1 or new.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information about how to use Kdiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / Changelog or in the file Changelog in the Quell package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile & diffuse 3; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & diffuse 3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE gives you the folder in your system where KDE installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & Beaches 3; autoconf and automaker used, you should not encounter any problems with the compiling. however, you should encounter difficulties, please report on the & kde; -Mailing list thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cutting (Ctrl or Shift) copies into the clipboard and deletes the marked text. insert (Strg-V or Shift) adds the text out of the clipboard at the current Cursorposition or replaces the current markings.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only differences display: files are identical in all folders and do not appear in the folder structure, and thus not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you will need to re-examine changes to these options to the folder with the function Update.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries to display the differences. this also leads to that identical files are not already copied into the target folder. if the target folders these files do not already contain, they are missing after the merge. (the behavior will probably be amended in a later program version) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons on selecting the source with the marking A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present), when clicking on the button are removed accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In the default setting, this option is deactivated. underball in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & kpager; displays a mini-show of all virtual working surfaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspace, to change their size, stop them or move it. this works both within a desktop and with several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & kpager; may display all virtual working surfaces as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows inside & kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked, if on the empty background of & kpager, the context menu has only the two entries to set up... and loading. if however, click on an application within & kpager; click on the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing, On desktop, and finishing. the commands do the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window on the full size of the desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Send the application to the selected virtual desktop. appears only when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this cross-box is marked, window within the & kpager; s can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other working surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, in the & kpager, the names of the virtual working surfaces are shown.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Crosswise this field leaves the & kpager; the numbers of virtual working surfaces can display. together with name, it is attached together with name, the names of folders, & eg; 1. working space.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is crossed, the background of each desktop is also displayed as a background in the background.</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is crossed, the current programs will be displayed as a small window in the & kpager; otherwise, only the empty spaces are shown to allow them to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here, the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple calculations with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the windows with their standard symbol and pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & kpager can be determined: classic and kpager; in a 2xn-Raster appear, as well known as Pager applications in some other Windowmanders; waagrecht shows all virtual working surfaces in a horizontal row, which is very good for the representation lateral on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pin-Miniprogramme in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can display in the size, display the windows as symbols or with their content and can move outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click on the right mouse button inside & kpager; and following selecting a switch set up... leaves the dialog settings appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this may not be changed in the dialog settings, but you can do it manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagc with any text editor, such as & kedit; or VI. if you do not want to register writing for the file, you need to register as a user root or contact your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowdered mode and assign value. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& moumousetool; emulate a mouse-click as soon as the mouse-cursor occurs a while at the same place. it is meant to help people who emulate the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) Syndrome and which any mouse-click pain is prepared. besides, it can emulate pulling with the mouse. this does require a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& moumousetool; can handle the pain using when clicking the mouse arises and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you can also prevent pain using your computer when using your computer, you should seek a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it once again: even if & moumousetool; pain helps to avoid pain with clicking with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the mouse because of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic aids is applicable: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & moumousetool; is simple: & moumousetool; monitors your mouse movements and runs a mouse-click as soon as you break the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shifts are activated, makes & moumousetback; move the mouse, waits until the end of the motion, before the slogan will run the mouse button. in this way, you can run the goat with pressing mouse button. the smart moving requires a little exercise, but you get used quickly to it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This wedge period must remove after the end of the mouse movement before & moumousettool; one mouse click away.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Is smarter relocating, the set field is moving (1 / 10 s) active. here, the time will be set, the & kmousetool; after downloading the mouse button waiting, before it will release the mouse again, if there is no limit for the mouse at the time.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& moumousetool; now supports clicking on mouse-postponement. this function creates a slow effect on the left and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool; the first time will be started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can shorten your reaction time. open the & collcenter; go to sound & Multimedia, choose sound system and here the rider genera. there is a slider sound buffer to shorten you to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting marks is marked, it will run & kmousettool; at every start of & kde; this function is currently only under & kde; available. with GNOME or other shutdowns, please drag the respective documentation to figure out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings to the values which were adjusted at opening the dialogue. have you already pushed the button on the button, the settings are set back to the last slide of application.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best use & moumousettool; initially with the preference. especially the smart moving you should be switched off at first. if you then click on the automatic mouse click, you can later take the smart moving.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the responses of & kde; at sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse-click without effect stays: clicking on the neutral ingredients of windows or on places in the browser window, which do not represent a link, will not lead to unreported reactions. you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse jerckelt, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse ball. as this happens, from mouse to mouse differently. it should be clear however, if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and soiling can be easily scraped with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system breaks down the execution of & moumousetool; if you have just started a moving course. if you are using the smart moving tool, this means that & moumousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by losing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & moumousetool; using another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you carry out a mouse-click. thereby, the status of & moumousetool; reset, and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you input text, tries & moumousettool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to a different location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor over there, where you want to have it. but you can't miss the mouse on a neutral area of work space when you're using a keystrophy. safe zones for the mouse-cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the cover lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart moving, but I don't manage to edit it.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart moving is an advanced function of & moumousetback; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy it into the clipboard, to add it into the clipboard, or run any other action, in which you want to move the mouse at impressive mouse button. but there will probably only be some advice. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Use the smart moving tool if you are just starting to start & moumousettool; click on the one end of the text range a mouse click and keep the switching key pressed while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and again pressing the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse button; the mouse button pushes a sound like a mouse-click. so you know exactly when for intelligent moving the moving time starts. later you can use the smart moving even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & moumousetool; to be able to use the XTest extension for & X Window; this should be the case on most of the system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and that is set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& moumousetool; pressing the mouse button once the mouse-cursor is short. this program was developed for people that suffer from RSI syndrome and which the antigen of the mostasten pain is prepared.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& moumousetool; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button loosed in. in this way, the pulling and derivative with the mouse can also be done.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filtering, text is dealt with, before it is sent to the program speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation to select false words or abbreviations, to select a matching language and spokesperson, or to deal with a certain lack of voice oners and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In order to understand the operation of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech Dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; differs four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it will be drawn to all other orders and keeps these assignments. if the edition of the Screen reader is read, the orders received will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders are continued after the release of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the nightly highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that can read messages. while you & eg; a long text on a website can be read, you can contact & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you encounter by the cardboard card is a text reservation. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text contracts are meant for the output of longer texts which have no special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just a reading, this issue will be stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen readers. you will be applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; -News.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter for the text and pass it on to the next filters. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are run as modules. in the future, there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings can replace parts of a text by other text. the added parts can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & nbsp; will be supplied with pre-defined string Emotifs like: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & mail; in a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; -Umformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. in delivery of & ktts; some XSLT files are included in the translation of & XHTML; in SSML included.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With intercom copies, you can submit orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text at & ktts; if you have set a female voice for example, you can read text from KDE news about it. Siehe. read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, after which he is applied to a voice output. if the filter notes that its rules may not apply, he will continue the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text application, a message, warning or a & kde; sent message to & ktts; sent it through all activated filters that have been created on the page below. the processing is carried out in the sequence in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the comfortably normal filters. if a filter does not gauge, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter, and it will appear on the following subroutines.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up strings, you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparator patterns. will these patterns be found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text. large and small case is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">If you choose a name for your filter, you can choose one. these names can be selected at any time, only by the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string "string" column. the list is being processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to postpone the marked word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can download a list of words or regular expressions from a file that list the current list or delete. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">Is here a language registered, the filter will only apply if the spokesperson speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you click on the mouse-click the & Ctrl; key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered, the filter will only apply if the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separately by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID run programs will be available with the program qdbus; the & DBus; -numbers you have to leave. if for example & qdbus; the application ID Copete-3432 is shown, you can only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string chilling filter is only applied to the text, if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if match. all input fields empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison of words the character shafts filter cover regulars in the form\\ s word\\. the words must therefore be limited by separating characters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this handbook you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. if you have the & kde; regular & # 160; expressions installed, you can call it in the dialogs to add or edit the help of these expressions. the & kde; Editor & # 160; Regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package indicated.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filter and propositional flow filter (SDS filter). SBDs may start reading text into individual sentences. this can also be synthesized by the first phrase, not the entire text order. so you can also jump or jump back on the cardboard card orders or stopping, even if the language learizer does not directly support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the propositional filter filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up by typing a propositional filter filter. you can change its settings or add more Statues, beginner, but will be deducted from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to try and check the language selection. check out the box selection orders, which speaker & ktts. check out the box selection again, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker has changed. of course, you need to have set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then you can start reading more quickly since only the first set needs to be processed and not the entire text block that can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can keep text orders on the card's orders or break off, even if the language learizer, this function does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal proposition is automatically set up for the first time. it can not be switched off, only removed. change anything at this filter, unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Propositional provisions compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator mark (tabular code 8) to the Statues (tabular code) are automatically removed from the text). note that the standard propositional filter is attached to the string.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; -News (kicking), warnings, news or the output of Screen Reasions.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal propositional filter filter, you can insert it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>

<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system administration mode. previously, all options are shown, which means that settings can only be viewed, changing settings is not possible. in the system administration mode, you can reach by clicking the button-setting system administration mode at the lower end of the module. it is the input of the password required.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three riders:</seg>

<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphically surface like kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is only recommended for experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on fundamental network technology is given, in the second all of & knetworkconf; alterable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section can not replace knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information on the integration of the PC is conveyed in a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large distribution. IPv6 is expected that in the near future, this description is concentrated on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the operator, which is a valid IP address, or if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address may not be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet for such machines can be made possible by hiring a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses are used in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254. the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">Additionally, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so all computers are on the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = of your own computer). the standard route is required for IP development.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The netaddress 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in your own machine. usually, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part you are the configuration files which are affected by & knetworkconf; where they are stored in different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file sometimes is dynamically changed at DSL connections so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections to find another content than set there.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& soldier; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar. the first goal was to create several archives on a tape. the first goal was to create a surface for tar, which presented the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective extracts. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a band can be used, it must be integrated by & kdat; this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& soldier: spult the band back and reads the pre-tension information of the bank. realize & soldier on the tape not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects and kiss; the prospar, it searches for the matching index on your disk. can not be found, you will be asked if the band index is to be created anew.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol of the band's work is changing to indicate that the band was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the belt can now be searched through out the application for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Prior to the throw of the bank, initially the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">There is a change of symbol for the band by changing the symbol for the band that incorporates the integration of the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be cast out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & soldier may be used, it must be formatted by & soldier; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band species must be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process corresponds not to the formatting at & kiss; does it happen before you use the tape of & kiss; formatted usually a formatting of the bank-ahead, DAT drives however not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the bandname and the capacity goes & kiss; with the formatting of the bank. all the data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you must select the files to secure files. that can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a folder in the local file tree. only this file or the folder is secured.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are secured.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the so marked files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu of Sichuan...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was initiated, dialogue will open up settings for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "" "" "if you confirm the settings, the dialog appears to secure the backup process, including data rate and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or a folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. it is only checked the selected file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a box. only the marked files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry.....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test process has been started, the dialog settings for verifying. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">"" "" "" "if you confirm the settings for verification, the dialogue will appear" "". "this dialog shows the progress of the test process as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can manage the re-establish, the files must be recovered, marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or a folder in one of the archives that belong to the band's drive. it will only be restored the selected file or subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a box. only the selected files and / or subfolders are recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog settings for recovery. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">"" "" "" "if you confirm the settings for restoration, the dialog appears re-establish. this dialog shows the progress of the creation process as well as the transmission of data and the remaining time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band indexfile by the bandcontent. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types of the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">Here you will create a backup profile with the exactly marked files and the default settings. you can make your backup profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder, in which the backup should be carried out. the list of data files will be automatically updated according to the chosen work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders, which are listed under backup files, is that only the files are stored on the same file system, as the folder. folder that are on other filesystem, you can list separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform a incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files are guaranteed that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file against the call of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons are pitted; and lt; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings allows you to set up the menu item in the menu settings... in the menu settings. the following settings can be made:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the banddrive (normally / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-recurring version of the band.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command will be transferred to the drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or typework can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option turned on, tries & kiss; to block the throw at the banddrive. possibly this setting does not work with all band's drive.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched, when solving the integration of & soldier; automatically the tape is discarded. use this option not at floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & kiss; the hardwareseives block size for the banddrive. not all drives support variable blocksizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kiss; in any case, block size for your band's drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & soldier is formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the bank. this file should only occupy a storage block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band-ID. the format of this string is calculable: seconds, making calculator the full name of the system in which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the epoch in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to locate a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat /.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with & GNU / - tar. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental securities.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup club. this symbol is only active if a band is integrated.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystems log; the program is suitable for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where to receive information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystems log; experienced users access the quick access for example on issues related to their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystems log; helps users to understand what your computer is in the background. the program is suitable for inexperienced users, which do not know where to get information about your system or where the system sets the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & kshaflog; experienced users access quick access for example on issues related to their server. & ksystems log; therefore, tries to provide some advanced functions with whose help the protocol files of certain programs may be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystems log; a number of useful features. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & kshaflog; functions available, with whose help the individual protocol-lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sort out. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this handbook.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start tries & ksystems log; initially the most important protocol-file of the system - the system protocol is opened - you will not open up instead of using a small news window, so you have a mouse-system log; very likely not with system administration right. the protocol files usually find themselves in the folder / var / log, for the normal users usually don't have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion. the list of the log lines is now automatically changed, so that only log lines are displayed next to the filter all. then a protocol line will only be displayed when in one of the columns the string string of the filter search is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also choose another entry at this point. select the string "string" string, and enter the name of a process, and carry out the name of a process so shows you & ksystems log; all protocol lines sent to which process have been sent or created.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of stage errors are displayed with a showy color as a protocol-lines of a stage critic. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched off-setting dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), you can look at the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case, you will use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Furthermore, you can switch the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystems log; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open up additional subwindow and manage. once you have chosen a subwindow, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystems log; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find more current information on the supply sources of & ksystems log;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystems log; also take a look at the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archiving: ksystems log; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv. this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is rapidly developing the standard for control of the system starts at the high level of the system in the & Linux; this is because it is easier to use, powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binar file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine on System V Init without having a reinstallation and new format. therefore you have to ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD init that configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you want to start at the peak of the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setters that only once started. such calls are after rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand at / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems own this file, even if there is actually not much used to do this. you can also want to run a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit of what to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first that he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard Runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the presented Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can proceed with the inittab changes. if you still have a bit of it, then come repair by restart the system and perform the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it now start all the right scripts? if you enter's -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stops init actually Systemservices? very simple: each of the scripts is written that it is a argument as start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts actually from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd servers. init reads the name, and if the one contains, the script will be called with the argument. if he contains a S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user-running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc., network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv. it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: just drag an entry in the range of Available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. thereby, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they pick an entry from the range of Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy it to a new Runlevel, you must select from the Edit menu or select from the context menu and even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to add the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries which have been thrown into the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of top or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired running level with inserting (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To manually change the sorting number or the name of an item manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by re-pressing the entry button to accept the changes, or push Esc to dismiss the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu require a confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc) if they are available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv. if changes to presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have cemented with the standard Runleveln heruMexican and now the machine starts re-resistant. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the entry button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have made some system services with & ksysv, for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, as system services are launched in these distributions, but unfortunately the configuration for the proprietary layout programs of this distributions, however, does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the programme for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all the configuration files are available (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply complete without message if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the user and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two carton cards, user interface and user list. to edit the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only represented when you have expanded system preferences. only if you have space requirements (Quota) for users, a box card will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards may appear if the shadow - passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd as in BSD-uniform are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card administration appears, if the shadow - passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD -uniform are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card details appear only to be activated and initializing (Quota) and initializing (recognizable by the file quotas user / quota group on the file system). here you can modify parameters for each user, where the space restrictions are stored in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected by means of the field file system with space constraint.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The carton card groups informs about the group members of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, you will find in the field primary group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by highlight them in the big field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the menu user or group or click on the matching button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or the selected group is analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO BootManager, remove the boat password, remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, modify, change and more.</seg>
