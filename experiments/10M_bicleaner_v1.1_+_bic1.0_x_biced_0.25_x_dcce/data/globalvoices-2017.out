although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American films , have danced with American music , American authors read and operated his sports .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist .
when 14 years old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fri@@ ght re@@ porter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magn@@ ates who were the Supreme Court of judges who wanted to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , everything else is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation had only reinforced for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so welcoming , that you can always be that you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had a very black@@ ish love written about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how to deal with his imp@@ unity .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he tells us exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it , and publicly explains his con@@ temp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ino , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 13 million votes , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that ever reached by the party candidate .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ?
I could not get Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example , Professor Bill Sil@@ cock , director of journ@@ alism , the people from all over the world take up a deep belie@@ ver man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Tr@@ umps Welt@@ illustr@@ ative does not coinci@@ de with the Peter B@@ h@@ atia , the current editor of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ h@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
Tr@@ umping intolerance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life long , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
still it fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life .
then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career .
these people and those who are em@@ bodied by them are experiencing my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump pier@@ ced his way to the nom@@ inee Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ piece to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps because of his con@@ temp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they all shared their racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , I broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as rac@@ ists .
to arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of which the majority who know are tuned for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed ?
in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with con@@ temp@@ t for those who look differently than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( ft . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ opening of the White against all other ethn@@ ici@@ ties , &quot; words from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and wh@@ i@@ plas@@ h , as said the great Van Jones , has done exactly what America has done so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality , it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is always welcome .
for this country chose as his president , twice the son of Ken@@ ian@@ man whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s white promise and says : hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the herds , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who liked in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a sound@@ strong &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ cked the quantity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lat@@ ino has a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they responded .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and sound@@ proof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ umps Country , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find space in this new America .
and that leaves me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , which is played in both places , not only the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump only 16 od@@ ters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds distant from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) plays in the municipality : one out of children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students is the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and bankrupt@@ cy .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and gave the youth so a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI are :
once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and play with shiny eyes and play in the tru@@ sting you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ go , and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located on the main garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay , capital - on instruments produced from re @-@ made waste material :
music with re@@ prepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycled under direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez so began to transform parts of apost@@ as@@ y into instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ tering violin , viol@@ as , c@@ elli , contr@@ ab@@ asses , guitars , cor@@ ds , trum@@ pets , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , and percussion , all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire covers classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ische and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article of the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez is a local ec@@ ologist and a musician for the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of the beginning :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a out of waste @-@ made violin .
today there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and that the project Orchestra is called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical power to : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates around one billion tons of trash each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
comp@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from rub@@ b@@ ish music around the world .
the orchestra has played his music even before the Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successfully fighting against illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing .
this post written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
the re@@ publication is done as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operated in liber@@ al@@ anic waters illegal fishing , before looking for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly taken over and slightly til@@ ted to welcome a footh@@ old of this species on its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they are ref@@ using to make one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing violin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ref@@ uted Ki@@ il@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan Fisher@@ ies . he is part of a team who discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the pill@@ age of the land .
at the core of this initiative , criminal practices crosses and resources protects , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) was established .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand up each other where it is about illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is in@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , conce@@ aled , there is extremely difficult to detec@@ ting because of it is the illegal fishing a leading cause of over@@ fishing by regions .
through the inten@@ tional mis@@ temp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm that a del@@ ik@@ ates balance .
however , while actions against illegal fishing were once replaced by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also by cutting @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions now occur in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there the individual countries can communicate with each other , for example lists existing licenses , to di@@ v@@ apor@@ ated activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour .
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open seas , using satellite channels .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in the botanical areas . also , so diges@@ ted lanes discover - some such that suggests that a ship invites its captured fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a criminal spirits .
countries that are against illegal fishing are based on this information then accepting such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their load . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing will be financially worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Director of NF@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain valued 20 million USD to lost sales , which will lose eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate the East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages , present to the region commercial fishing from around the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
among other practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake licence papers , specification of fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically use the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ seamless control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could be illegal and a country could not say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you dar@@ ed my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Com@@ m to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ ects ships .
it has exposed criminal networks , which had distributed counterfe@@ it licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has fle@@ eing boats and found it .
thanks to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to give suspic@@ ious ships of precise locations .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be further developed , also helps to track the illegal vessels that likes to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , which they can no longer be used by satellites .
Cop@@ eland is helping build a system that connects different information levels with each other . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world market by means of each of the single fol@@ dable ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with neighbours to get a better idea of who is doing what is doing - this makes simply sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system per@@ missible the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel criminals , but also deter@@ red .
ships who had previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and hardly expected to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fisheries management , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia helped , Gre@@ ko 1 re@@ trace , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tu@@ pp@@ nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now also other countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa a hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing every year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , to the so called West Africa Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; they now fight against illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of bringing more such initiatives and structures to other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member land of Somalia could report his first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was released under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and have been used locks networks , which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into the bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a particular , collaborative way to protect oceans actually works in the entire world ocean . Emma Br@@ yce is a professional journalist and lives in London . there they writes on the topic of environment , technology and nutrition .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . location in Venezuela is continuing to say : demonstrations in several cities with the goal of earning the country . &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
in protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the bai@@ li@@ sen@@ th@@ eb@@ ung of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

especially big waves hit the news about police oppression in the central north @-@ north of Marac@@ ay .
there , the prot@@ esters went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed supporters of the government .
hours later they left the cathedral again , but the protests went further .
in other parts of the country some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ arian T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not carry sk@@ irts because you could otherwise see something that many National@@ gar@@ den@@ ies don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the extent of repression per day :
thus , the dictatorship has suppres@@ sed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an office procedure - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of other innumerable people on the street .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was forced by his father to join the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba .
as by now an adult man Qu@@ ij@@ ano said in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military @-@ per@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
34 years later he retained the secret of the surname for himself .
in the situation back then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manip@@ ulated by his father .
at that time I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie@@ vements . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983 , a time of state frozen , was his father from 1976 until 1978 . commander of the secret services 141 in prison La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qu@@ ij@@ ano , the oppres@@ sors , who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qu@@ i@@ jan@@ os son , a man who realized during the years the scale of atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy and who said before a Federal Tribunal against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent , and how this child has chosen for itself a way of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was rounded up with a boy who made combat sport .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend about it .
he said ,
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP
pass only that they do not take you one day and I must save you .

therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would become a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . for so my Father had raised me .
on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simple everything .

&apos;@@ dah the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he commanded me to increase . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just all possible - were standing .
everything from that was stolen .
he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket wrapped and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that it was a great l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke where the stolen items were dropped and subjected me with an aler@@ ship .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I sp@@ ined into and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on the people .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fortified the one end of a cabinet . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
they rarely get a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , they poured him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the rocks there in it was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked me , How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me for the third time to work , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were cap@@ tivated by hand@@ cu@@ ffs and bind them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people with the face down - all were cap@@ tivated by hands and feet .
near the entrance cau@@ dal men silent on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why did you otherwise brought me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father talked about it at home .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and k@@ ills .
( according to indications of survivors the civil is Jorge Rom@@ ero , which was also indicted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the memorial La Per@@ la , by the former Fol@@ der chambers .
the way you came here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map you &apos;ll see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured it for the first time .
here their names were altered and they were assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization a number assigned .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were cast into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ phem@@ ism - for the sho@@ cking of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos; mare
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; back then at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war @-@ mare &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war is a ba@@ on@@ ett or perhaps military @-@ sign that one is fighting against an enemy .

but if one walks into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ lt , then that is not a war @-@ mare but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could be involved in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an Officer with Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and to ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
once he called me a criminals and I said , and thou that you miss cars on the street ?
you are not criminals ?
he explo@@ ded anger , struck me and cried out :
if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you hanging .
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time I took a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover out of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothes at home .
back then I accused the defense to have been a co @-@ conspir@@ ators in this crime . I resist , no problem , they can lay me the burden what they wanted .
I was anyway there to tell .
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act &apos;
now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . if you have children first , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I was even so far to say :
well , you have executed people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kids disp@@ ens@@ ed ?
one day my father brought a girl to his house whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they just could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom you could commit their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ ous act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was introduced back , they used machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
they were sm@@ ashed and somewhere ent@@ ail - no idea where . &quot; one will never find something , &quot; said My Father .
but something of course remains always .
&apos;@@ I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father .
the thought , to view my Father , was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I did not kill him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt relaxed and asked me , what the whole exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried ,
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate .
he res@@ isted only &quot; Na then put me on . &quot;
exactly that was what I did .
in 2010 I re@@ generated the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ ach me that I am taken before . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qu@@ ij@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still ahead of the process .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : among them severe , un@@ lawful freedom of freedom in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture and subsequent death in five cases and a fall of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .

the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the span@@ ish order of the judgment .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 and crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity . the Court imposed in 28 cases of life @-@ long pen@@ alties and in nine cases of prison quarters between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was mis@@ test .
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .

Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by uns@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court part is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years to justice for victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ W.@@ O.@@ S. , which represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was found , so that there was a memorial site which is now managed by human rights organisations .

a translation errors makes the elderly in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the shield with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend its leader .
the photo was spread in social media .
edit the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where you can extend its leader in the last month , witnesses of a very special translation .
on a shield , the Japanese word means that the &quot; older motor@@ ists &apos; means , fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with BÃ¶@@ sem rear &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists . &quot;
the false translation was on electronic display in the entrance area from 1 to 20 September , and in the building itself .
edit the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was often shared in the social media .
the error was to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , one of the inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the proper , if gram@@ mati@@ cally not completely correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the pre@@ fecture Kyoto exc@@ used for the translation errors . furthermore , they stated that the bug had already been contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely apologize that elderly people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older motor@@ ists in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police there are the percentage of older drivers that are involved in accidents , but quite an occasion for concern .
in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for instance , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents of seniors . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , the seniors caused 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
this will increase their share of 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of the elderly caused by the same time increased in the same period .
the name non @-@ mentioned re@@ porter brought comments to light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudices some Japanese seemingly are against older motor@@ ists :
the article on Yahoo with the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( fear@@ ful motor@@ ists &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the translation is actually not , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not find that that is a real translation defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true fund@@ ament for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
for over@@ putting two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is in case of mat@@ ernity . in general the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - mother language should be .
so to translate a French mother language , for example from English to French - not from French to English .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language , translations into English . this may lack an understanding of overcoming , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers , to learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees , nevertheless leave fir@@ ing internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English skills are made as the best to be done , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ren@@ en and pu@@ zz@@ ling sentences resulting from machine translation show that this technology can still not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages quite particularly .
some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which are often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for stylis@@ tic reasons - not to be read or understood at all .
photo by Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be as jewelry yet acceptable or at least harmless . but from large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translation .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serial source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors take on internet and television
main@@ page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Fre@@ ies Adventure ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soc@@ ied@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet user useless , they do not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the internet pages of V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also over@@ threw pictures of the protests in Caracas , who were organized by opposition groups , who oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro@@ s .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was dressed , and recommended the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of turmoil .
traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 during the 2014 report on protests . back then , the Commission of telecommunications would like to report on the demonstrations and lock@@ ings when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission was calling this as a call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have filed myself again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two lit@@ re lim@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also affects the website , on which the National Assembly res@@ umes their meetings .
previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider will be able to use DNS . this is a technique , by which the DNS server requests from certain domains answer .
when a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server answers or deny the request during the call to such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third channel , the transmission was set on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V c@@ amer@@ aman Elvis Flores , which was transferred to the protests in Caracas , in custody .
Flores was beaten while he was in police officers .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went again on shipment .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage about the current events in the country still further .
in Paraguay a lot of girls will be slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , Tina fights for the rights of children and collects testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas which were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a documentary by Kurdish , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en , &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , exp@@ iry schools &apos; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices , Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she did not live together with the family that was living there .
shortly before her studies at the university , she returned once again into the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one has become of something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as cri@@ adi@@ tas , one refers to Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money out@@ puts her inferior son or her inferior daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned yet is that children must be paid for countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of an agreement which is not going to lift . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this act as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered records , researched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to call things on behalf of name , for the sense of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ adi@@ tas , guarantees in general un@@ silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family , who complete her daughter in the belief that they are doing so their training to improve their position in society and &quot; something out of itself &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family that takes up the girl and justify its exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive training , and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mis@@ diagnosed , his family will only experience many years later .
sometimes they never learn from them .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in the hospital , her body showed traces of fierce pun@@ ches . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Mil@@ itÃ¤@@ ran@@ ged Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the residence office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants to the east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira proposed on a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injury .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on the incident .
she stressed that the assass@@ inated child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen company &apos;s practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest and called for &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows as children are registered , &quot; defend@@ ant Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
with no papers it is much easier to inj@@ un@@ pun@@ ished the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a breeding investigation into the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be the landmark - when the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers in which their father worked , conc@@ ise had to register and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go working and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets , to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
at the same time , it had to divide the time that you still remained time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock each morning and prepared breakfast for their employer .
Friday for example clean@@ se the fridge , p@@ utz@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more they finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never been star@@ ving , but did not get un@@ bound@@ ed food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books out of the house of house@@ keeper than eating out of the fridge . &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the game Liber@@ al Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on some evenings of the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give the official media reports on the regime of dict@@ ator no faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held her for intelligent , but did not stand with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be able to learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there once again , that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ i , speak at home once again their mother tongue .
their Lord feared that they had the formation they had made her to lose again , she explains .
it was very clear , however , that it was for everything she got from them , paid with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing about which almost never is spoken , har@@ ass@@ ment and the sc@@ ic@@ anen are exposed to those cri@@ adi@@ tas when they go to school .
because the other children parents have , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time , where friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not one group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society cheapest the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share advertisements for clean@@ ers and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay .
the administration of the group is P@@ EPA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town carrier in the As@@ unci@@ on district .
hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and afternoon .
to learn .
please send you .
start from Monday , if possible .
the ad received five &quot; Lik@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she would have had a two @-@ year girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old nie@@ ce . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them .
in the third commentary was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , who wants to work . &quot;

in the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ) , the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores ( in which the workers had to be de@@ ported and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) . therefore , it is not to justify that many girls and boys are going to engage in a system of slavery , where they will be easy victim for abuse and exploitation .
social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
law enforcement writes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian Parliament recently voted against a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and utility of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is adopted by the Parliament , the user and users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law then a job would be set up , which is in charge of providing citizens with citizens to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months of adopting the law , users and users have to register with their correct names and personnel policy , in order to register social networks .
if there is failed to do this , this could be a punishment from up to six months imprisonment , or to make money .
the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ ves and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; je@@ d@@ we@@ de application , which is running and used over the Internet , to communicate with others by means of voice , video and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced if the draft does not exist , as the draft authorities are unable to specify the user and users the registration . unclear is also how to make those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliamentary delegates and sponsors of the legislative power , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user@@ name and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptian people and Egyptian to submit information to their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans are .
experts and experts on the spot are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leadership research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as they are violent by physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
when I take it seriously , this means that they are to set up a strong surveillance system to apply for citizens who apply a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a judicial process .
this is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must be discussed at the legis@@ lature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ised and ensures that no sof@@ tening nar@@ ration on the surface is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was provided for those who are guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Iraqi Kurdistan region in the north @-@ east of the Iraq , the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the respected Persian leop@@ ards .
one sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards that strike through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find more and less prey .
why is this specific type of leop@@ ards so important ?
like R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ ors in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also that a great prey beast is present .
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the wild way is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks down in pure joy .
as a trained Biolog@@ o , R@@ aza is passionate about another side of their country that is not only made up of war and conflict .
for six years she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and the education programmes of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to making protection areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , documented in the northeast of Japan , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o , the progress made during the past six years to rebuild the life of those who have been affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukus@@ hima had triggered the disaster .
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a pre@@ fecture of Japan &apos;s nor@@ theastern which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring areas of Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced out , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
still , the Pre@@ hima pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima still experienced a nuclear accident , already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the Special Report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o shows what progress has been achieved six years after the progress of the local residents .
the detailed report of the paper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected people themselves .
the construction situation in Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ns
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o paper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( s ) , a total of 9 pieces , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate were finished .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures were made of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , and here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fukus@@ hima is the balance of Fukus@@ hima with 70 percent of the final light .
however , one always tries to move even six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated by hand@@ hel@@ pers ( of the others , cas@@ et@@ su it@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final spare parts .
after the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ns in such terms .
almost 40 percent of 2011 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated shel@@ ters , which after the disaster in distress , were settled into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures
as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by un@@ happiness , their tor@@ ches up to December 2016 , which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of fisheries base in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have now been in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing industry have res@@ umed their operation at Fukus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have been in co @-@ ordin@@ ated in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukus@@ hima .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic bomb is , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of arable land of Fukus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear zone &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered over and again , but again Fukus@@ hima remains far off .
the economy numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 per cent at the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fukus@@ hima on the other hand , however , can only have 75 percent here .
however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it was harder to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a full picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . she asked her about the status of re@@ building and also how their emp@@ athy have changed towards the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o led a survey in order to bring more about the un@@ ami awareness among the native population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done .
as it comes to those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in their edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Sh@@ imp@@ o newspaper has increasingly directed their attention to the position of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima .
Fukus@@ hima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols , nuclear accident , which has ever had to experience Japan .
of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
in the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23 000 people , back to Fukus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts were settled .
after the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture .
in disaster regions , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated regions are still older than 50 years old . they have failed to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo .
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encounter people from other countries that speak another language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , however , you often recognise that one more combines than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely to these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat subjects that will often get fewer attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone about language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i explains about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Vi@@ o@@ let@@ a Cam@@ ar@@ asa recalls how the love of music worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in artificial com@@ a , after he collap@@ sed by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Luz . publication with permission .
right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva at a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the Inten@@ sive station : last Friday he had defeated a police officer at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a tre@@ ad against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a sk@@ ull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors performed him this Saturday and now put it into a artificial com@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local picture journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , spread rapidly within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
on the pictures the face of the police officers is also identified with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police were known in the Brazilian federal state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident has been suspended by the active service .
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
if a police officer would be audi@@ ted by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive station , his face would be six months long in television and all the oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ iz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several San@@ itary confin@@ es to him shortly afterwards .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective is also noticeable in social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ lians to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and permit his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing has been divided several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s &apos;s memory :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experienced a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish has been assass@@ inated by his father , because he was an occupied school with a gas station . and now we have been attacked the very griev@@ ed case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by an police station , after having been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has beaten him into his face .
police attack
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brut@@ ally against demonstr@@ ators in the last Friday .
police officers at the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked via speaker to sacrifice violence against demonstr@@ ators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country .
once again the Brazilian media prot@@ esters have fal@@ si@@ fied by taking the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically on a paper@@ back glass windows to make a picture of their title pages illustr@@ ative .
in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with one on the fire @-@ built bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken wind@@ shield than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also recognise if you are strictly against any form of damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are being decei@@ ved by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with police &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the de@@ induced villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all over Cuba closed doors ( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - to Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there is no noteworthy sug@@ ars on site .
it is two years ago when the activity was l@@ aced in the sugar cane .
after the rise , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory lost gradually and according to its facilities , until only the rum@@ st of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some have changed the work .
other res@@ ign@@ es and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , who is up every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not kill his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , who are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were preserved .
that was something he didn &apos;t expected .
N@@ ene reminds us of that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been held .
the sugar cane industry already resist the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effic@@ ien@@ cies , the bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 production was produced by 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country for a few decades , but the poor harv@@ ests have already been no new .
why was the Cub@@ an sugar cane industry turned out ?
the old train station of the church had already been better times .
( photo : Julio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories , the annual production plan was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nonetheless the sugar price grew again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os must remain a pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and the FAO , the Agriculture and Nutrition Organization of the United Nations .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tons ) , the raw export business would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the lac@@ tation came from a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane of Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene is known as a soldier , about the closing of the factory , the word that he is repeated the most , &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
thus the place is preserved , they formed a full time - working group .
before the first opening year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by U@@ lis@@ es Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any withdrawal .
from there the responsibility over the days and the letters were becoming more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge for the occasional factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for still in operation . &quot;
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for the retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was opposed to his will at the lac@@ tation of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with each part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and more important work producers was er@@ ased .
in many cases , no alternatives have been created for the working conditions and services that were generated by the plants in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether during the Mamm@@ ut speech from 21 October 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present persons saw , when he guaranteed that for the regions whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would run well .
the price of the population is closing to the closing of the sugar cane .
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by the M@@ ole .

after two years , the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , that many things change but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane plant closed , or better said than they began to ro@@ cking them , they also heard on to paved the road , this disadvantaged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories .
they were to spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began working .
Ne@@ un@@ and@@ four@@ teenth releases the old soldiers a r@@ ents of two thousand aus@@ ing Pes@@ o per month , in order to retirement the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a down@@ ward person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
it has been tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes up with 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bitter .

first Nations young people use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
recording of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . do they do by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour run mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live exhibitions .
the original workshops were managed by the educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop increases the young participants in conversation topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , analysis , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever of them comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos;@@ Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the territory of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , explains the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section of West@@ kan@@ ada on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered .
the cases have been largely un@@ resolved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the refrain is sung on Cre@@ am .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group that gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ out of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ anz@@ he is available in trans@@ cript , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here :
sometimes I feel like no one would ever care for me
but I try to go on earth for my days
that is the day when you will take our cry
because we lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and proceed as our youth
this is how they can do what they determined the Creator

in order to show potential customers what exactly on the menu stands , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( which means to be , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of every dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether to enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic meals .
in the Tokyo district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies that have just produce that plastic courts , which was documented by the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic meals are so usually that they don &apos;t even see them any more . however , a new trend is turning it today into show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with sho@@ ck@@ oo san@@ ity .
now at special sale : new with plastic bags decor@@ ated cell bands , as they are shown in K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , Cooler Master :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ated magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of Essen@@ ti@@ fications becomes increasingly complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a cell stru@@ ts .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that establishes your mobile phone :
designed to see as an apple , with a candle for mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone @-@ on and mobile phone designers allow you to make your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; are there someone who would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wow , cool , now I can provoke my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic visions can also be a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our newest mobile phone @-@ handed has the form of mel@@ tdown .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and Hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon .
other sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic labels can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # # 8217 ; or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 8217 ;
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the popularity of the restaurant industry . like , with the sho@@ ots san@@ ity .
the following video shows how Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports , foreign and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the los@@ mis@@ hes and transmis@@ sions regularly appear in statistics . however , these reflect not at all the extent of the human trage@@ dies that this fight against itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ Kart@@ ing , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly in the background .
on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the bere@@ av@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind every cor@@ pse , behind every bone loss in the hundreds of pav@@ ements , the stories of innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds might never heal .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico declared the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co . &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trafficking , said to give these victims a voice and stories of people told that in the struggle between the prosec@@ utor and cart@@ els .
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que c@@ ambi@@ an por el mie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life &quot; ) tells us exactly these stories .
one of the main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who has kept secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father and two sisters in just one day , her husband and two sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have been asked to go and to graves , according to the people we loved , &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who also is here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you stand at the assurance of my father , but that does not get it paid , because that require a ster@@ nation .
where are we supposed to get ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co , &quot; why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a Les@@ erin by Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post by Tax@@ co , at the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism I have been known for several years now .
I come over every day of newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the title pages with images , which actually can only be derived from a textbook for criminals or from A@@ ts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the sing@@ ular or sadly it is sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they go through the streets .
for me it is like those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them too .
I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ el@@ essness of human beings is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to speak , that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stir@@ red and quiet .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of ex@@ tor@@ tion in the main urban district . &quot; in this it describes how armed crimes were put away from their business until they end up not only the business but also destroyed their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain about it never dies , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes back high , if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the more we are removed from each other , the better .
it included her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , for you don &apos;t know when they perform or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the reply is no , because I forgot how to crying . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence written by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assass@@ inated by organised crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ ity ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells you to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Ch@@ ich@@ i &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the surface with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother was gone .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood has been past two years before , when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home , who saw bloody crimes of his father , which was shot by armed men from a squ@@ ander@@ ing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
in 2006 Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders for public security and government of the United States .
in 2010 alone the prosec@@ utor 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this is equivalent to cut 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands who are organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ading the country &apos;s soul .
only few stories live in view of getting new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to tor@@ tured the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in intelli@@ gible way .
when a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages to which he is linked , these images are shown on which violence is represented .
the factor check is important at a moment in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or , or fal@@ si@@ fication a fake .
but how is the years after something the first time sur@@ faced ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to pers@@ ist .
let &apos;s take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
these false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - deny not the fact that there are abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our longing for images on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 a tank @-@ wag@@ ons crossed the place of San@@ ge in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ es and explo@@ ded . there were 230 people came to life .
after the civil war , Africa has been a two @-@ largest country for years and devast@@ ated it . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths that were difficult to drive .
trag@@ ically , the pet@@ rol trucks fell victim to the victim .
the official representatives described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ ed houses covered , including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ating the soccer world championship .
houses contaminated and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the un@@ know@@ able .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ more photos of the incident form the gray scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of shor@@ th@@ ated body that irrit@@ ate on the ground while persons they look at .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo was fal@@ si@@ fied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not related to related trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am had attacked the Nig@@ erian towns B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye@@ witnesses reported dramatically from atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops have been burnt down and cor@@ pse in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were sm@@ ashed , shot or burned .
only by satellite images could be displayed the following times .
the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
a mass@@ acre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
you are not Charlie .
you are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failures ; Africa check has documented orders for Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament for mass@@ ages .
another step further brings personal comments like this example , the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message , published by the United Nations who could flee stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following address that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this photo comes from a sau@@ di @-@ Arab news page that ended in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ a being said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she used the picture from the DR Congo to be@@ see this information .
the original contribution , which last published on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations that have called AF@@ P as their source , were also noted that this statement was written , but did not make the picture taken out of the DR Congo .
the world @-@ wide range of false information
traces of these false coupling dates back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reverse image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( stand of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found the said picture from the DR Congo very similar .
they come from a combination of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , others have tried to relie@@ ve the counterfe@@ iting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have absorbed examples for the mis@@ used use and linked them to the respective countries on which page they were published . by doing this , we want to be more evident than by the language alone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the countries below ( which were also associated with each other ) , several examples may be used for abuse .
here are some cases that can now be fully booked ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the or@@ an@@ ed countries indicate both sides or servers , about the examples of counterfe@@ iting or fal@@ cons are still available .

this judge which has appeared exclusively in English also includes references to counterfe@@ it images of rum@@ ors , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to outline that Muslims kill Buddh@@ ists and the other way ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ical nation@@ alists ) .

this post , which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , suggests that the DR of the Democratic Republic of Congo does not show Muslims killing Christians .
Saudi @-@ Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page clearly affir@@ med that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein has been given in 2012 that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story to the picture from San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still included in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 over students , who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic Social Page An@@ Ã¡@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar cre@@ ek attack . &quot;
as the picture later in connection with the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ ya@@ hoo@@ .de U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and del@@ etes a discussion among Muslims following the mass@@ acre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities were taking these events , the mut@@ in@@ comparably in the name of Islam , had a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the mass@@ acre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were attacked in no religious context .
instead the goal was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( es@@ isch ) , 2014 .
after a message that was supposed to be written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acre was in circulation , translated it on discussion , like this here in the Vietnamese and explained it to the mis@@ message .
from the Embassy in which the picture from the DR Congo has been included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of a faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on cap in Grau ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer completely re@@ trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web@@ cast , and exp@@ elling them in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all these cases , which only appeared clearly after the original warfare of 2010 , the image may ultimately possibly be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
Fr@@ ames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that these Po@@ sts go through . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslim - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated compared to a European or French life .
wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how pictures in connection with these efforts are used .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these pictures .
with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ inten@@ tionally share the water around a tragedy .
sug@@ gesting this mood of mis@@ - and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and narro@@ w@@ ns it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that keeping the back of images of a ref@@ usal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and viewers des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work on it to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment , because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image can be sug@@ gesting , which actually may be used either from the context or completely mis@@ cre@@ ed type . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any examination of false subsidies should also be considered as internationally it can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . un@@ re@@ plac@@ eable ) strives to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ usable words are already well known ( such as the famous Portuguese su@@ ction ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ ak@@ esa ) .
but everyone resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly with every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ us@@ h you with your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years .
and words in H@@ uns@@ creen language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ zin@@ ess that you feel after spending cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst fl@@ ut@@ catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst flood and lands@@ catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally uses end of May , are passed through strong rainf@@ all the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are mixed .
over 400 000 people have been affected ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places .
the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water@@ ways in some areas went slowly back .
health and hygiene of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ for@@ ama city with water states of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly fluid exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue crisis , warns save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in high water , water standing up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the yesterday over@@ thrown water level of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da E@@ la .
the Air Force has provided five planes to rescue operations and further five are made for transport of emergency services included in their flooded villages closed down .
also various organizations and start@@ ups have been explained to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ es in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
if any search and lif@@ ebo@@ arding d@@ ron@@ es for their operations require , please call the number 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate the dry food and life @-@ necessary goods for flood @-@ offerings -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97 or 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ o centre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ stur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; high water help &quot; button which allows users to call for a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then forwarded to the s@@ ri@@ le Red Cross .
in addition , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; button which resulted in more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat actions for high water and lands@@ li@@ ous people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring people in need in need of emergency and help support aids in need . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;

use approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend .
I trusted her my four year old daughter to trust her children ; she is my rock in the fire .
in one minute we call for par@@ ole for the rights of women .
in the next step we are rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and men , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ towel high , bound from an American flag , other sc@@ ou@@ ting slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years to separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - of the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
it un@@ Muslim me .
there are 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be Muslim to different kinds . but somehow we all put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer .
this dra@@ wer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , which are as I don &apos;t fit , un@@ Muslim .
un@@ Muslim will become dis@@ Muslim
I ste@@ h so not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry in America is best sold : Rum@@ i .
which images come to a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as a blinds in Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was a orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran , and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry .
but in the Western idea , religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this dele@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the reduced images of Muslims , Western books have been col@@ oni@@ alism for centuries .
this temp@@ ting voice is determined by the dark man who should be afraid and the exotic woman who should be saved .
the pioneering Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ car@@ ded the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these images continue to rise further today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood acquisitions they continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I worked for thirteen years in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty nar@@ r@@ ative fo@@ atives dominate our news@@ letters .
this Nar@@ rati@@ v o@@ vers@@ had@@ ows the reality that has led nine Muslim women over the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this nar@@ ration fails to acknowledge that when French , Muslim women are prevented from bear their head in public buildings and sau@@ di @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body that these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group puts its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong nar@@ rate weak@@ ens Muslim women , the movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on the American ground of Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this nar@@ rati@@ cally has our collective imagination of such deep and fla@@ vor@@ ful that often Sik@@ h @-@ men and children are used for the aim of tim@@ us@@ li@@ ous attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we can tell is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
which belong to 1.@@ 7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create fo@@ sters that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ os of 1,@@ 7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to make seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigration of the first generation , which come from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rant parents came to live in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American stun@@ ts from Bangladesh and the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time when Khan was re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were essential to Muslims and Americans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now imperative to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Americ@@ an@@ erin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes when I wonder why I am not a pig farm , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or carry my hand@@ some flas@@ ks to bear all the Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pe@@ pp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not wear all the flas@@ ks with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected at the airport for almost always . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of emin@@ ent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam .
these lies are produced in the current volume of a well @-@ produced Islam@@ fin@@ ite series with banknotes , Thin@@ k tanks and experts for Fal@@ sch@@ information which is our already faul@@ ty picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manip@@ ulated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the manner in which we can tell , the Islam@@ ism is in more than just a stranger who tear the head of the head .
or as the scary map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .

Islam@@ ism in its ugly forms understands our adher@@ ence to .
it takes our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and diverse , that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .

I want to explain this .
I was born as the Muslim but a Muslim has only been born in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
when social scientist describe religious life , they attack on the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behaviour might not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor to see my neighbor in the surf that I am Muslims , if they could look through the 15 meter concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all@@ ab@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I reli@@ ed them in my arms and her the Arabic verses for the protection of the Quran , and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

Muslims to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims have to be how she taught me to relate to God : Allah M@@ ian , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a people , that - over centuries - was established by an &quot; Empire &quot; which a company established with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien com@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colonial countries &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected in a century above a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my Grand@@ mother , an Indian , cold @-@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as a &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as a &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he conducted the first mosque in England .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1.@@ 7 billion people are deeply moved into our unforgettable family rooms ; our un@@ stolen history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops that were distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , were to pursue in Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the ruins of the war .
an American Muslim means to know that the su@@ icide @-@ rate of veter@@ ans has risen by over 32 percent since 2001 .
it means to know that when a tragedy is home to the US and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name , which history is reported four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four @-@ hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ists named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X a American hero .
it is the heat that I sen@@ sed as people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we are saying black lives .
an Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a K@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , represents the in@@ dur@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1,@@ 7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch become structural Islam@@ ism .
structural Islam@@ ophobia is in the Muslim registr@@ ars that began with President Bush and President Obama has been extended .
it consists in consistent surveillance of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders on people from the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list , &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims into the Vis@@ ier .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we throw from Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University showed a scientifically non @-@ correct image and b@@ ate them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 regarding evolution .

the Con@@ vers@@ ations , which we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we come back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous prints , which we engage in our news actions .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslim within the media industry , which tries to grasp our frequently with ties with ties and forgotten history .

but I am worried about this difficult global time we are in .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is a reason for the conspiracy theor@@ ist that existed in the dark corners of the internet , now the White House will lead .
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have Muslims led to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years ago , she had not been given her ; now they dominate a large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am worried about the realities and the story I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who have made me today &apos;s in@@ ges@@ ted Muslim .
things that I left behind here like a snack bar in my speech .
things perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that makes our humanity like a story , where someone is being made to another . &quot;

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people by creating the &quot; others &quot; in public opinion , four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions about the role of this , conscious and un@@ consciously aware of the &quot; others &quot; as my girlfriend and I think in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake is spe@@ ech@@ less , while he has already broken countries and &quot; among others &quot; people bom@@ bed and goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.@@ 7 billion .
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
stor@@ yt@@ ellers , by Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barriers ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the umer@@ ation of stories in their original language is a possible response to it .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ named blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written basis , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already performed events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to children .
for the creators of the project are valid :
the mass dying of the languages of the world may be avoided when we create cities , assume diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while listening often is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to the list@@ ings to appreciate , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ eller puts its history first in its own language and then translate them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional trainer , so lead their devotion and their representation to the audience .
they call laughter and emotions that the language no longer be a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate is also the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative for their land .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the har@@ es and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after having explained the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara was asked , &quot; How did it speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide dit@@ ch he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness :
you have heard !
you were attentive ...
they were very with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS in order to tell their own stories .
Puerto Rico demands from the US Neu@@ fest@@ ation of State school
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which participated in 72 million US dollars , participated in various religious and civil organizations in a mass demonstration ; the march started with the So@@ tor@@ ary Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
called by the group &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Civil Front for the Neur@@ examination of the debt ) and the Ã@@ kom@@ en@@ ic church meeting Puerto Ric@@ os .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the debts of the debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is her demand :
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os demands that politicians , banners and government agencies responsible for debts are accountable for their corrupt .
we call for a financial review and a guid@@ eline without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions appropriate re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation , which acts in favor of the economy .
we will be pressed and suppres@@ sed .
the people of Puerto Ric@@ os refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our reti@@ re@@ es will not find themselves with sin@@ king payments .
we require immediate action .
the island - not into the state @-@ bund@@ ling territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organisation without party membership is focusing on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state of state .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
measures imposed from the outside without the participation and conviction of the citizens are risk of being rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration took the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been mixed for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s : public@@ a , the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture that is oriented in Berlin , dedicated a meeting of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign .
MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie d@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; published books within three to five days , las@@ es excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ dies ( The cost of freedom : a collective neighbour ) .
the book , which was released last year and here license is available , contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of repression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction there is :
this book wants to discuss as movements for Fre@@ ies knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Fre@@ ies have been working on page to look over the fog that surrounds our news@@ letters and to create something from our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who has been de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was painted from the Ab@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information on his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which are pushing for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let &apos;s start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what have we decided ?
what have we given up in this process of timeless extreme beliefs ?
the Web@@ developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention of governmental authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military proceedings from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported to be contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad administration and realized it from a alleged death penalty against her husband .
his place of residence and state remain unknown but still unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project built in Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes are predic@@ tive than the work that he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the passing cross of many civiliz@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and per@@ si@@ can influences .
at that time Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything to it , this architecture , which not only em@@ powers the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but of the world .
this strip , into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a period of time that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .

N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and ba@@ it taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read English well , write and speak .
he has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked him . he taught other incar@@ nate , write and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought the internet to me .
he has also attached other incar@@ nate how to use computers , at least theoretically , without having kept one in their hands .

Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) has disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption tra@@ vers@@ ed director after the arrest of his sentence again to previous post
Mos@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corrupt , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison along with four other defend@@ ants ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the Mos@@ ambique airports , whose council stood Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately asked his res@@ attitude to the company , which happened on April 19 then .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Assembly of the Republic , which failed to apply the motion , there would be no obstacles for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return his old post as the company was not discipl@@ ined after his custody .
however , many inhabitants do not know the action well .
the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re @-@ charge the director :
represents the lack of transparency in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we take note is that also the company should have led a disciplinary procedure against the resistance movement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the company contradic@@ ts , however , and prompted no adequate legal steps to use the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mos@@ ambique social media , this behaviour also re@@ jects the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reluc@@ tance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and had half of them .
he could keep lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company he helped damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be gladly paid for its silence .
reluc@@ t@@ ably !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young musli@@ m , and student of Political Science in Brazil , says the director of no morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za from the state rewards because he ins@@ ul@@ ted him , I can not believe that someone was rewarded with so massi@@ vely in such a way .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is missing to return to morality and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as the hand@@ ele it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre @-@ loaded and sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind you that a th@@ ief was part of the prison :
Die@@ be belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ ines , the Mozambique is not only to be remembered as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , cutting @-@ cutting and - incidentally - prophe@@ tic Red@@ ner .
one of its most famous oral representations was , when he energetic confirmed that &quot; a more ambitious person is capable of everything , also the father@@ land for its ambitions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he does not change the tactics but he doesn &apos;t turn off from his ambitions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is simultaneously criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ closing :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat for 10 years and came free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or sp@@ elling .

according to information from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known soci@@ ale network took its posts from the net , because they played the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although over the origin of the word it is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ t origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the others ( in bur@@ mes@@ ic Scrip@@ tures ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements gave the word an extreme ab@@ ide@@ ation con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sensual content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically calling from hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in order to express their use .
furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with a different mean@@ ings that have the same letter such as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ically also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( camel ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the various mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends on spiritual ways , if she knew how he can relie@@ ve his back pain by making a word play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + das Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ically - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radic@@ alised nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical , before it was all Po@@ sts , which spread in suspic@@ ion , racism .
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ ebook .
what it should do instead is to analyze the mail carefully and control it by checking the following words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( gap between ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ story nation@@ alists who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , received a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to cutting their nationalism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords often become a K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply to start to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from social network :
... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the lifts , post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; Facebook community standards not dis@@ missed . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radic@@ alised nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have been doing more about the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community to ask for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform , but this doesn &apos;t work .
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical assistance , and as words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as curr@@ y . &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they didn &apos;t attempted to am@@ end the fal@@ si@@ bly dissolved Po@@ sts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits , they would have great revenue , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided a lot of pro@@ ach among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users become aware of Facebook funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts who had no hate speech , but nevertheless they were removed :
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical text reads , &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian movie and watch an Indian movie .
just to check if Facebook contains the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot used with permission .
over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to use social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed for his failure , who retired hate @-@ hate speech on his bur@@ ial pages under control , critic@@ ised .
but instead of just cens@@ ored the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would be better to look at the context rather on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is at the end with the children before
a wedding ring in the sand .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously decided to ban a law that is supposed to ban this practice , so that the old age is now at 18 .
prior to this change in the marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities were firm on the practice , and in May 2016 , the leaders of the inter@@ religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group of representatives of the different religious groups of the country gathered that the state cannot interfere with , since that , age , not the ripe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is an authorized partner of the UN &apos;s rights Convention , the min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; min@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; defined every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical central office of the country , that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 .
online Pe@@ ti@@ tions and social media movements that were committed to disman@@ tle laws to children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no concerns about telling the critics of children before , they should , who still take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this sort of religious opposition sort of tension in this actually complic@@ less cause , and at some point there were doubts on whether the opposition would correspond to the draft law at all .
but in the beginning of 2017 the draft bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which meant to be discussed at the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the President of the country has to agree and proc@@ laim the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators announced on Facebook a status update , which les@@ ion @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle was posted on Inst@@ agram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against the children before was elected in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this and no one decided against it .
having decided earlier in the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of the social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws for the children &apos;s before finally been changed .
Facebook @-@ member of Lo@@ vell Francis , who suffered a ministry in the Ministry of Education , said :
it has so much time and unnecessary talk , used to wor@@ sen the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the mon@@ og@@ amy before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now , and that is worth every price .
while A@@ bel Jackson of the opinion was , it was definitely long enough to manage the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ e Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook of Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which implies : , , Excellent News !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the most popular age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the population of 18 years .
the draft for the amendment of the German law was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and of which were 35 present during the vote .
all members , who were against , have voted for the law .
the mon@@ opo@@ lies in Trinidad and Tobago are no longer permitted by law .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ ren@@ age@@ Gu@@ ild@@ hood .
many thanks to all activists who have drawn him out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our members .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to be able to engage his promises . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the general prosec@@ utor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a suppor@@ ter of the law said it is quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj would go against the law they wished for most social media users , one would approach the debate on the subject matter .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , when we , instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that only panic and inno@@ cu@@ ing can give rise to the fact that the state , our daughters to protect them that they might be beneficial to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s before in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or continue to be the norm , although there are laws that they fail .

on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption , which coinci@@ de with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day - the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s website was ch@@ opped off from the Yar@@ osla@@ v@@ l district . h@@ ackers have left a funny message .

around 11.@@ 15 the message was removed from the side - but in the cli@@ mac@@ ros , however , it remained intact .

on Sunday morning the office of the Pro@@ secution , the Local News Service Yar@@ news discussed that they were ch@@ opped .
through the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can see another Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , reciproc@@ ally to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright law in the USA , internationally dar@@ k@@ elt .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey un@@ ra@@ ged the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia .
day by day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porter and fans of TV @-@ series rep@@ el off against the blocking .
although a lot of technical use Internet users are used to use conver@@ gence tools for block @-@ block websites ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ prevalence of the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been written by Wikipedia , just as recently in a published report by Berk@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law was adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
according to China , Turkey is the third @-@ known country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain locked , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ F@@ S ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) than the Platform all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alised peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine @-@ host connections ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is now available in spite of the legal ban .
in a blog@@ post IP@@ F@@ S reports about his efforts :
since we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) we put everything on it , sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ F@@ S platform . thus , the possibility to read content on de@@ centralized and distributed ways .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ F@@ S also gave that this step is done independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ isten from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to hollow similar mir@@ rors when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .

there is no complete copy of a proxy address , a mir@@ rors .
one access a different URL that is not the original one . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when these are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ alese wildlife photographer uses his camera to raise awareness of the need for natural protection
a su@@ zu rhin@@ o , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and washed colours .
the motivated himself was a camera to wear and try to deal with the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar attempts to bring Nepal to the international scene at the age of 28 .
and his homeland is right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that direct attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook as this will help him first @-@ class position in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer ! !
I just rested home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood tigers already from face to face ,
a tiger can be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not in sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I was back home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately drew up , we look at and he star@@ es me through the Sal @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Children &quot; ( lit . : I clicked on environmental protection ) on his photos .
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ alese and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited 22 days long and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , there are Indian women for the first time speaking the name of their hus@@ bands

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az , and was originally written to Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
a revised version was once again published as part of a Content @-@ sharing Agreement .
in many parts of India , women are avoiding the greatest care of speaking the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences should they abuse the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by an Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a manor and rejected by her family and the community of the village , after having married a married relative with name .
the tradition of their wives also did not name the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less s@@ lic@@ ences to fear , if at all , they should not come out of this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the Pun@@ e district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health guards as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and were thus fast becoming the main navigation theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to un@@ cover practices , such as children &apos;s heating up to the ex@@ iting of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ esses of change .
the first video that showed the Roh@@ ini in its discussion round , was of women who do not name their hus@@ bands in the name .
she has decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem which women can easily identify with .
to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands , there is a Br@@ ing , which they all must be paid and never put into question .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this as a che@@ que , as a woman without morality .
the tradition has been deeply rooted in so deeply that we have never thought about this discussion round .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , which had never mentioned her husband in the name before , at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells you :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband shr@@ ink@@ ly long after the video was at the end .
intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name it from now on by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started its first discussion board .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that there was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the issue in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video@@ projection the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in the promised women to never speak the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells you :
a woman was so shy that she died during the whole exercise just ahead of himself ; another decided to allow the whole gest@@ ating frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ renalin talking about , with an old Br@@ uns broken , the women decided that they would actually try their hus@@ bands to name their hus@@ bands .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini was given a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ red , she was afraid and said it was an error .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arose in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the car@@ cin@@ ber@@ red point on the forehead , which shows the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus :
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband , that I would wear the galvan@@ ized Red Point , if he also k@@ icking it .
he laughs only and I listened to him to wear it .
the other women have not stopped completely so , but think they are now in a better position , even to choose him not to bear in some days .
for many women the discussion will be a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip at any discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what could hear &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent months , she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; they danced and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things , such as our identities on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to say certain things according to say , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only supported Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ was @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide hem@@ d over a pants , wear ; they did not trust .
after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ election , mor@@ als linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , the Roh@@ ini her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Upper shirts ) into a discussion round , so that women could wear them .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can carry je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will be able to create it .
on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion , have already changed , Roh@@ ini , that things are slowly coming into roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of her hus@@ bands .
some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and are not a different family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
women in discussion will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the feed for more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating the river .
by giving each other self confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club everyone gives us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reported to other people what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

a new system of kidn@@ apping for gl@@ ass@@ istants , probably for non @-@ believers purposes , presumably by the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the intern@@ ships .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims were de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been removed .
two men were arrested and in consequence they stood that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi .
I give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a gl@@ ass@@ ment of gold could bring gold or wealth , explained the police officers from Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on flat @-@ member men were registered in Mozambique .
another group that is the target of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN adopted a mission in the South African country to investigate these intern@@ ships .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Ireland , where the government has developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel into the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men , who are travelling to Mozambique , are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks , war@@ ped the Mos@@ ambique police after the latest assass@@ ination of three smooth men due to their body .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange where the murder took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Lag@@ y Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ n in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already been following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of gl@@ amor@@ ous men .
the persecution and assass@@ ination of flat @-@ member individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district Mor@@ Romanian bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , for probably ab@@ err@@ atic rituals , has also an@@ gered the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also existed , according to which the victims have power in mind , the riches of the riches .
in the last days three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , the indicated that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique faces :
I would like to go to E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , whom people would have dressed to go on the road , and they would not hurt sex against good notes , work , and other achievements , a nation where people would love to earn their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ ass@@ essor for tru@@ thful purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; will be ch@@ ased that aim to reach their own wealth .
despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for ma@@ inf@@ ant humour did not miss .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which probably has recently been made .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of de@@ tained Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; after the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to , which calls for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has described Li@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he said it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet , Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ eing or allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ dened on the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised several responses from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Com@@ miss@@ ar of the United Nations for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials in order to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment if the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad to be a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway took the shock , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government expressed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon @-@ headed by China since 2010 , since 2010 the exports were largely blocked .
once the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a unconditional release to expression and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo .
because of its imprisonment , he was not able to counter its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was requested to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants .
the leaders of the EU , Federica Mog@@ her@@ ini , called for the release of Li@@ us on how to participate in a statement on 30 June
at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Li@@ us married as well as family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; us Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad said that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far it helped him in his con@@ val@@ escence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary and Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the message submitted to Chinese authorities , not only Li@@ u fre@@ iz@@ ers , but also to liber@@ ate his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the invitation from the US Embassy moved a fur@@ ious response from China after itself , with the exterior of the State Department , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with an un@@ answered and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
protection and freedom such as travelling freedom and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal systems , as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mer@@ kle@@ y and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push Li@@ u and his wife condition@@ ally .
I call on China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so he could go into proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokes@@ person Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 , in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by Li@@ u to visit Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28th , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family make sure .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously told that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells you :
Canada is calling for China to uph@@ old his international human rights obligations , including free speech , true and responsible for the exercise of these rights .
France
French Foreign Affairs called for China in a statement on 29 June on , Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and family can contact him .
although the news station France info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , there was no further information that France will not pick up for any further information whether France will eventually take him .
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the festive affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June on 27 June , Li@@ u fre@@ iz@@ ers and a greater tolerance for those who use the peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legis@@ lature Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u by the ruling Democratic Party Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellbeing .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been rigor@@ ously pun@@ ished , led to a harmon@@ ising , stable and aff@@ lu@@ ent China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens are inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .
license : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shan@@ mug@@ gling , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this observation has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
during the meeting , during a meeting of the international branches of the Chamber of Law@@ yers of the State New York , the Ministers noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , because they are compared to other countries .
he support Singapore as a city should be considered .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I tried to explain that we were different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Caval@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to rot@@ ate &quot; the logic , &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , we can say that we will ultimately be no land .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight from the responsibilities , a mandatory injury .
Singapore , if you are not my land , eat land it is then ?
the reasons for Shan@@ gh@@ ost were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given that , it appeared inevitably un@@ democratic .
however , it def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re appears from author@@ itarian rulers to be present , leave the tw@@ isted logic , as it adap@@ ts better to their power .
in the end @-@ effect , the answers to his American guests were given the answers to his American guests in regard to our press , our it@@ ative , our political system really non @-@ answers .
corresponding questions tar@@ ma@@ ths he with non @-@ answers to rational species .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ gh@@ ness to clear his opinion as it did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , it is a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Shan@@ mug@@ gling the effort to get up this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the city of Singapur .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he pointed to the reviews that one should begin to read the full address of the conference , so that one could understand the context of the memor@@ andum of Shan@@ mug@@ gling better according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the wording .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore is so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died in Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously meant it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an presents his disappointment about Shan@@ mug@@ gling , who is a leader of a growing generation , such a po@@ le@@ mic statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said , ...
at least I knew by Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , and the members of the old brig@@ ade , which I expected - do I agree with them or not , but this is another matter .
but with K. Shan@@ mug@@ gling , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review die the weakness of Shan@@ gh@@ ams Arg@@ um@@ enten :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr Shan@@ gri &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did a mistake on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ben@@ ign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
as he plays an important role within the government &apos;s cabinet , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mug@@ gl@@ are on the importance of heavy importance .
why do they afford their military service , they do not defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel policy ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , and has always been a city :
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have a lot of people angry ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we always had a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country mainly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by putting personal questions .
on my clear position then follow the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ wardly in anger , when they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me that .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack if they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there is no weapons with us !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is said to be considered as the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
first , I have many American friends I very admire .
nothing would be given to me if you would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamp . &quot;
first : as a &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to , is basically , mirror @-@ hard , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &apos; The Simp@@ sons &apos; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) .
if Canada would really be a nation of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter .
harmless , means un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to be and no attention to deserve .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , remot@@ ely from the things around one around .
I would even go as far as to say , that the desire to be free and alone , is a prime minister of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own issues .
what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we are lacking the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au joined the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ ded Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band has released a music video , which took over the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and restore the civil government in spite of its ple@@ dge the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ sty Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which rules makes him his girlfriend .
although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days , this was divided by Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 lique@@ urs .
last month , the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activ@@ ist challenged the public to look at this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ special about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has pers@@ isted in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; 44 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the commander of the army absolute decision @-@ making through important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 11th rule : &quot; changing your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; imagination &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities to be responsible for activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit has been set up in the army , supervised by online content and individuals who accused , the monarchy will be denied .
Thailand is set a stri@@ fe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ Ã¤@@ ts@@ ei@@ rist ) .
on 20 May 2014 , the war was set out in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to be prosec@@ uted , its decision is expensive U @-@ boats to buy although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how persons are thrown into a black v@@ ans , before you bring them into a dormit@@ ory warehouse , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are sitting in the prison , because they have supposedly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and internet users will be offen@@ ded long , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band made the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute from Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Asia @-@ Asia

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri St@@ ate@@ y@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ war war has officially ended , but its fo@@ ols are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ il@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asien .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , weak@@ ly , Geor@@ gi@@ ans , and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to so@@ jour@@ n in the area .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also named in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia as well as Ge@@ ister@@ ium .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 the total population of 16@@ ,000 people since 2011 was hardly ever risen by a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ kov@@ t@@ g@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and quite rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it &apos;s hard for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unique . &quot;
in front of the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens , all served by the community .
now there is only paved road with verbal splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central plann@@ ers of the Soviet Union , have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which are still one or two families , one recognizes on balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
as they discover me with the camera in your hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our Mother has banned us that we can photograph ourselves , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is simply forbidden to us , that is all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining companies called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in sub @-@ contractors ( cultivation of agricultural products for equity ) such as livestock , bee@@ keeping and vegetable plant .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not abandoned in front of Ab@@ le Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay forever in Ab@@ le Asia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she does not support her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pensions are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and spend holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do so - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha G@@ aly@@ a calls her to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could construct zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day they remembered the village of thor@@ ns in front of the war .
despite the relatives , who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ le Asia was simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased country in Su@@ k@@ li@@ i ( administrative city in Ab@@ ch@@ asien ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains it re@@ um@@ ented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband is working in the K@@ ohl@@ bauer .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that it was initially a very frigh@@ tening situation than many people left the village after the war .
but in the course of time she lost her anx@@ ieties .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work , and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember each day as the city and war once were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation comes to the end , a little boy goes over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hiding them .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted him back .
he plays with the ball , which then rolls the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the dropping buildings .
these ruins are part of her childhood , which provide for uncertainty in their lives .
you do not know it different .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the State of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ acking was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the path of migrants across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ell and gol@@ d@@ colored ear@@ rings in Te@@ ddy bears @-@ form .
it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born there and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama &apos;s .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit .
the hotel has rather no charm .
for about 2,@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with k@@ ole , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haiti immigrants come here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the top of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cardboard boxes .
it wants to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medication they can not pay them , they sm@@ iled them with a bal@@ m that had exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if mom@@ my Africa had an appropriate nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jog@@ hur@@ t@@ che ) posi@@ ert with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acking .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it fits her as African women are very nice women .
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again .
they have already been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move toward the north .
the family had heard of other guides from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey into the United States .
he has been a guest in Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the B@@ usti@@ cket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us that their guests will send their often text messages if they went to gr@@ aci@@ ate them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have given them to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
in this winter , Valencia and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the B@@ usti@@ ckets are sold to numerous African migrants to be expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar per night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly shar@@ k .
some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking location outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States .
the majority of migrants travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled with his wife and three children before men who wanted to press money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , a single @-@ known , offered him her roof .
some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers also consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that their house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those that have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she is fed in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair fle@@ es who made her a manifestation , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travellers more , boy and the elderly .
they laughs sad , while they put them briefly before .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; you have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users , which is possible to pass by far from the company .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users at the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification in which it indicates the District government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 h @-@ h women in the autonomous Il@@ i pre@@ fecture were arrested , because they had installed the app , just after they had replaced the app , with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , that the app would determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and follow , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective power supply with System @-@ categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elecom .
the main function is the block@@ ing por@@ no@@ graphy web pages , from online che@@ ating , tro@@ jan@@ ers and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network .
this app with fil@@ tering for min@@ ors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these features can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers can manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it .
this introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often gri@@ mmer for those who live in remote , depres@@ sed ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ely Internet shut@@ downs .
based on Twitter based media ou@@ let &quot; images from the China &quot; ( of the mod@@ ulus of mod@@ ulus ) , the cens@@ ored messages published in China showed photos by a check@@ point , on which polic@@ emen the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ate then if they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they might be de@@ tained by up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the camp .
we are back again in ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from the China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images of King China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password demand of a Windows operating system , allowing for full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city &apos;s party Council to minimize the proliferation of illegal contents .
all government branches , authorities and the related institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when running their computers and communications devices .
a current report from Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st of August its &quot; personal ID maps , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards to register with local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy them . however , this action does not viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible approaches , including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , Part 1 : all cry after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane shares his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at and set you that you &apos;re alone on a place where everything is important .
everything has gradually dissolved and a truth , which is clearly recognizable from both inside and outside .
one who makes their name all glory .
one that has manifested itself into a list of feelings and expressions , which do not allow any metaph@@ ors .
but when you get the reality back and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn out the characters in beings from flesh and blood , and all cry after death .
all doubts can be found in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the un@@ he@@ ils . you will realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone was built around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to make me &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the leader of the security service it form@@ ulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he asked his power over us , by even destroyed the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn during a peaceful protest like wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it came out so that the city cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ an Ak@@ bar &quot; cry .
all the neighbour@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , just my own .
for the first time it was silent , reg@@ att@@ un@@ ning , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that stands up into the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce .
during the third night things had a little cal@@ med down , after the electricity supply in the district had to work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by crying out several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice through the silence reluc@@ t@@ antly .
a few minutes later , some of my friends were brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends closed to me ; we joined ourselves to a glorious picture , which met my expectations fully and fulfilled .
in such a moment you become aware that you are liber@@ ated the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply does not interests you in the bar@@ ing@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low you - nothing can give you your voice , after you put them all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men : my father was already there , as I am now .
the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let &apos;s listen to me as you &apos;re &quot; O@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only then brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ ted eyes rich@@ ed on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity , perhaps at the Revolution .
I was as safe as I answered , &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in sol@@ itary and his father immediately with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father immediately with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the f@@ ank of this per@@ flu@@ ent set lies in me until today in the nose .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture , which I was exposed to months .
I walk the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a walk to the single cells .
I gave me all the details exactly before I went to the room .
otherwise they have probably assigned a greater cell this time .
I have to share it with just one other prisoners and may immediately sit myself without having to wait for their permission .
after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I went back to a well @-@ proven communication method : to beat the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ fin @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ head office &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me ultimately .
apparently , in any of the surrounding cells there was a prestigious man middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness let me know no distinctive face , and doctors are not there here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like me ? &quot;
all the answers have one its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately listen .
the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would leave him if I stay .
li@@ ar .
I &apos;d like to have had a bird @-@ shy to exp@@ el all of these cro@@ ws that lab@@ s on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I still hear it &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
it must be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ playing on the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , the secret was successful : to protect state security from us and to prevent that we che@@ ating the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ board and sm@@ iled the narrow eye @-@ view of their world view .
this is not a house that is here not a country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their cl@@ an into a hero .
I went to the audi@@ ob@@ room and tre@@ ad on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky male ; at least he comes to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; despite the facial expressions , that you gle@@ am , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important to your life than you can join this t@@ age@@ di@@ just and protest on demonstrations which will soon be finding an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have used it to me not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say anything when ins@@ ults and blows after a friendly conversation become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to be pun@@ ished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the affection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe that probably comes out of the Klo@@ acks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is at your cry .
give it the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you can not with@@ hold your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not able to play it enough , why they inter@@ change the pipe by a cable .
during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a trash , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment .
they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within a single hour three of them altern@@ ated three of them , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no favor at all , why he was next to an electric packed ring .
flow through my whole body , enough to store my whole quarter .
my hal@@ ted bodies that lay down on the floor was the perfect power leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been at midnight for midnight .
I decided to lay me back again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours left , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
the door opens up and the morning light meets the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I responded with the voice of an exhaustive young people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my master , my father must make dre@@ ad@@ ful worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be silent and away you , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the j@@ ord@@ an R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b speaks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was recorded by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b spends the majority of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ ve to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again also to his couch .
but what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his nic@@ otine lips to discover .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had heard them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) .
for six years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and free expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of the Syrian Arab world , however , it also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only rich in their hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ anz but also in cities that are rich in Syria through to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with its 25 years H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a person who is not restricted in his mind by limits , and can be according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he grants a special dis@@ credit against the US American foreign policy .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas , something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian f@@ lowed - even if he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a man , while in water rede@@ emed Nes@@ cafÃ© in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset .
the law of the law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramad@@ an .
obviously H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do with protest against Islam on the other hand .
basically the sle@@ eves are loud coffee and the swe@@ ar of K@@ ent cig@@ ars in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky above all when you have a look into the neighboring countries .
therefore , you have to do it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramad@@ an of water to drink , in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior of Jord@@ an@@ iens has told a appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila , already for the second time .
some parliamentary groups , supporting the Islamic action front - the j@@ ord@@ ian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ tal @-@ singer Ham@@ ed sensu@@ o , the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradic@@ ts and the main reason for the concert .
the members and former press conference in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was said &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many say in addition , the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the well @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the whole region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila the j@@ ord@@ ian people as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is continuing to employ &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement is likely to be simply not simply @-@ to @-@ face rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic but in fact a more clearly marked @-@ cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work .
in 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional Gender Standards zu Lei@@ be , adding his vision of the fate of Arab women to have pres@@ iding sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently crus@@ hed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; volunteers &quot; - the in@@ official outside .
human Rights Watch claimed its climax in 2016 . however , the number of volunteers reached its climax in 2016 ; however , it still appears that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence in 2016 .
according to a law for crimes against crime from 1954 , women , who are exposed to risk of in@@ fam@@ il@@ ess violence , &quot; and for their release , is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen .
also H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy back on issues that are long as tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , but doesn &apos;t matter that he &apos;s his music , the full explicit beginnings of sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics .
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a policy of politics &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are politically active in the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which man , in his words , &quot; what you want , &quot; be faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were deeply cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ian online programme Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn away from the context , inter@@ woven and his opinion was cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says .
today H@@ d@@ ai@@ b openly acqu@@ ires H@@ d@@ ai@@ b open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , still remains in memory thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work later on behalf of the pot@@ assi@@ es , in the eighth century could write openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ anian not ?
the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ al intelligence service took several former government officials and members of the teaching network , with the grounds that they have expressed criticism in social media critical to the problems that are deeply rooted with deep in the country .
given that the concert H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs views only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change within the next generation of the Jord@@ anian .
for him progress is a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has promised Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Le@@ ila for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks slower , cautious and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ ian society .
ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dreamed not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them to experience &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region is shaping up with music , art and literature on a true and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , stre@@ amed uni@@ tions and in artificial ways of making guided democracies . at least he hopes that .
until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to over@@ lap and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these large , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding origin of Neb@@ uta Festival .
you suspect that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory implies that the Fest@@ ing , dr@@ um@@ mers and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over and from a time , in the armies of Japan mar@@ ched in the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to pick up a few great seats , so we have a great view .
it is difficult to imagine how big these parts are ...
a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally t@@ l ) .
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two forts are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True and a stunning way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ at@@ tem@@ are !
Y@@ at@@ tem@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high feast was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

rare , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep away the Peruvian youth from the crime and promote a legitimate job like the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us more important port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road consuming and illegal drug trafficking are daily .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region could not be secure .
at the same time Peru experienced Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports enthusiasts such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more standardization into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can provide these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity even has inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts to show one another in order to show who you can create the ec@@ centric L@@ ooks , as one can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook @-@ profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to spend young people to dive their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and get a training in the hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the offer opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job which is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year , and reported about some of their achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love Let@@ ters to guer@@ rilla war

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the Beit@@ rags &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commandment to guer@@ rilla warfare &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not yet much more important , people who feel themselves lou@@ der , affection ?
exactly this question was the two young Colom@@ bian activists from the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation not more from the head and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Re@@ pres@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people to write letters to write guer@@ rilla letters .
only recently , her country was the place of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; international was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ rilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic and , around the clock their arms were carried out , now they must now be integrated into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred towards the guer@@ rilla war , then they must record them into their ranks and support them in the creation of a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that is exactly what they did : up to now , thousands of young people have written letters - commandment to former guer@@ rilla war to welcome them back into society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla warfare , which then shall be given to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in BogotÃ¡ , in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , awarded the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this stated that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much needed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he plane , he told he continued to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent advice .
thus , the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to build up a new life . &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a common history of peace . &quot;
up to now , more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and BogotÃ¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the UN Camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ verified in Cal@@ i , two of the members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ Art traveled in the camp to transmit the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC put themselves on how they had done it earlier in order to counter the prec@@ ep@@ ts of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters of under@@ mining people from all over the country .
it was a very busy moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political knowledge @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a employee of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we had given the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighter .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ illa live ) saw , I saw a guer@@ rilla war that wrote something .
I had to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the rest of the tube .
&quot; &quot; &quot; anyway I spoke to him and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I responded to a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never before in my life someone has written something so nice , so I responded to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I suddenly saw the tears about the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embr@@ aced him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of war , I was tired to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and wanted to help him to write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
for the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and took the F@@ ARC already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state had to develop into the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country .
for a purpose of this scale it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; said one of them .
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who have never found hearing before and no election right , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate , even people with beautiful emotions that were revers@@ ed by their circumstances and environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me sore .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much harm to teach us something and a smile can give us a hug .
many former fighters have responded to letters .
Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian has been prophes@@ ied that after the dra@@ inage for peace prevail .
this is not the case .
as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and protest to their rights . and that is also totally justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , we call on all def@@ ender of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they hear - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring victims , because we know from our own experience , that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
with terror activists have experienced the reporting of recent months on persecution pregnant men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ value above the dor@@ sal a@@ Q @-@ community , is not only generated by night .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic currently .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ law in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines , after reports have been published , the exhau@@ sting , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic are discussed .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ ak@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chn@@ yan authorities , the suspected que@@ er men , and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
Sabrina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew there .
already since her childhood she felt that she was in fact a woman .
when they grow up , you became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ et@@ sch@@ enen had experienced by the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened at Sabrina .
it is out of fear for her life and ultimately moved them to the USA .

one day I told me that someone took my help .
it was a familiar from D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ woman who put into trouble in trouble .
she had no money , so I didn &apos;t hesitate to delay it without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , she was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chn@@ yan friends , with the following news : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I just got to show a few shopping spots from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men say : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
when I turned into my body , I sen@@ sed something in my body , but I did nothing hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on the Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want the family to be , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thou sc@@ and@@ stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was f@@ lown .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ boards in my right lungs .
OC Media : what kind of health did you put - in the men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sole@@ te , there &apos;s still my male name , but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ dal name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded me back to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going up without the streets ; others wanted me not changed in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I did not change my sex that everything was just bad , and Photoshop .
I have body @-@ size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to handle this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some elderly people spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; You have brought a Monster to the World not only your family , but the whole of the republic .
we cannot touch you because you are a p@@ ious woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a stri@@ ck around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into a flat and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark windows and a numer@@ ic plate with a 95 dr@@ one .
after the third time it happened , it was clear to me that there was a bit lazy .
my human rights @-@ friends audi@@ ted the numer@@ ic signs - it turned out that I was persec@@ uted .
OC Media : how did you f@@ lown ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to disclose their names , but I will say that I remember they all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my m@@ um as soon as I arrived .
I bought them without having to register without reading , without proof of everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it in the garbage .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered on a for@@ eig@@ ner .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not think about you , just because you leave the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you st@@ ak@@ est . you even know your room number .
just to prove it &apos;s : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , but that is a tab@@ u@@ topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements are still in me .
so much I wish I wish , this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera I actually give me trouble how to watch the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I have submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who was eating one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that during Ramad@@ an no man were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
so that my I , they probably invite you to relatives , these will take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men stored in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine says , there would be not very many .
if , then above all those who have no rich relatives , or who were dropped by their relatives to ask Kad@@ y@@ rows court .
as far as I know , they will be held there so that they can present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be revers@@ ed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked either any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alize himself .
OC Media : is this just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source of this information ?
Sabrina : I just quote someone who was de@@ tained for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has since been nothing new from them .
they simply have taken them with them .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was by himself when these people were involved .
until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports yet . we suspect such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if this per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who have been listening to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair for long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think before 2003 I was already familiar to Gros@@ ny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the shar@@ ia was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia was originally intended to approach the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately came back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the shar@@ ia law ?
Sabrina : my eyeb@@ rows were tor@@ tured , I had colored eyelashes , carried ro@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the security of the shar@@ ia never stir@@ red me just a hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chn@@ yan language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ ake not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
one often says to children if people make themselves funny .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed , you were sick ?
Sabrina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to talk about morality in the TV .
he did not speak about us , but above the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people of the town began to change .
anyone who suffered and laugh@@ ed before , viewed you on once with suspic@@ ion .
in time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily worsen@@ ing .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you proceed now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t have a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
I am still working as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , connections , I accompany them to the hospital and helping them to get f@@ oo@@ dle .
I have no pen@@ ny for this .
I discovered these people myself when I flew away from hiding place .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
so is nature that has nothing to do with religion at all .
this is exactly the same as Che@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no pigs .
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have who , the Cabal have , the Russians , and which ; on the whole planet there are - but not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear about what to hear .
I meet so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and during Ramad@@ an - live with men .
do you know many thinking about Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ction .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be accurate , different lifestyles .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
sorry I will be here as personal , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ murder within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate among the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months there has been a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ essness that may arise in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z work and remain anonymous .
one on YouTube shared video was holding the moments after he had beg@@ ged himself .
some people made it quick to clear the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ han@@ i hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could do nothing more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only su@@ icide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and campa@@ ig@@ ners on site warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month was a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanging .
their stories have one thing in common : there were all family pat@@ ernity who felt , due to the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable of taking care of their families and pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi calls for poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab ancestors living in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their living .
in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was an mainly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i Mon@@ archy assumed power and under@@ took great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy all over Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran @-@ coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most common and most valuable utility areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population gets a little bit of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships .
the Iranian regime declined to the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also built a variety of lam@@ bs , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian regions , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these lam@@ bs have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region through drying , and devast@@ ate local farming as well as fish and palms industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi @-@ young people rose to 81 % now .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director of cooperation , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a job , finished school , 55 % a further school and 45 % have a university degrees .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Doh@@ im@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young ancestors of the Nazi men .
Ken@@ im@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse recently . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z , new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the creation process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi takes access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside of their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their suburbs and names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and become so attached , because even the Arab names in the workplace will not be tolerated , ref@@ utable because the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances that the Arab ancestors had to endure , human rights activ@@ ists alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I do not identify with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
if I say that I am not femin@@ ist , many women - in particular white women , who call themselves as an inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well through scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , that women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come to a single ceiling , and that discrimination on the grounds of sex are still moving across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known .
I am convinced and I am talking about twice and thre@@ e@@ fold among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to talk on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black transi@@ ent women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ community or on black women from the Diaspora ; when I speak , on which kind we have been physically , mentally and verbal , both in and outside the feminist movement , decide to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
but nevertheless all agree that women - all women - should come together to raise &quot; their voices and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk that there are in addition to sexu@@ alized violence an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women in two times .
or above that black women and women of other ethn@@ ici@@ ties and home countries earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls are referred to more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence suffer from a higher risk of suffering , domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want that all men , all men and all men have the same rights at all . on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect to a movement as a black woman whose center is the white woman who refuse to refer to the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ feminist spheres , who repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner mour@@ ned 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refused to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a human and margin@@ alised essence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to connect myself group@@ ings that also absorb our customs and customs in order to drive its ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to reach white women the importance of the excess of skin color and gender . for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to make them become a better .
even though the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women from different homes a home and devi@@ ate themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name .
I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join me the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather that pers@@ isted for a white feminist paradigm so that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it &apos;s more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves in this way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will call immediately separ@@ atism and exclusion , after having read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I existed .
I &apos;m recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life neither passed , nor ignored , nor is rejected .
pad@@ lock against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published once again .
over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past 7 years - mostly with board @-@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern for the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers and the impact of pollution to its church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of reservoir , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ h@@ Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video Mus@@ a takes the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ s@@ key , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq based documentary film@@ maker and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , produced , filmed and published .
the focus of her work lies on the followed , little notice sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques , with their help suppres@@ sed communities to tell their stories in their way .
Paragu@@ ays Women and her difficult fight against violence
a group of women constitutes &quot; The crying women &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mor@@ de in the country and in the region and show their rejection .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by Kurdish . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Christmas @-@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) which reported on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect the persons concerned .
a police comment@@ ar said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they have nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their Ex@@ partners , who had become violent to him for violent .
since the end of her relationship had passed some time and the police said , her statement would be placed to the acts , but more could not be done .
when a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for Mis@@ sh@@ ir@@ ation , also useful the acoustic display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing .
a few days later the second wife moved their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women do not even refund , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also dependent on the men that they mis@@ sh@@ out . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence , sign the victims of violence at all .
inhal@@ ing 1 beats and Statisti@@ cal 2 Un@@ visible Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ als and a legal system , which do not sub@@ ju@@ g@@ inal 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty realisation of pun@@ ches and statistics
it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ sh@@ and@@ led , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher at the Centro de Doc@@ ument@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that not even ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise the extent of the gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them .
however , the figures available are however al@@ ar@@ ming .
in 2015 at the District stadium of 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women .
86 % of ads came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace . also here 86 % of ads came from women .
in the ads , 40 % of women said they were physically mis@@ diagnosed , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic mis@@ trust .
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ an women &apos;s minister in Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who has been re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mis@@ trust ad , 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who would be re@@ funded because of physical mis@@ trust ad , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated it at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s icide in Paraguay is no own criminal off@@ ence , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s authorities can not be documented adequately how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman is due to violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ als and a legal system that doesn &apos;t work
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but then there was still . this was supposed to regret it forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together . but for two years she bore mental violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recogn@@ ising the most severely recognizable :
I never thought that I would once be victims of failure .
when I have read earlier this , I always thought that this is just women who are too embarrass@@ ed , because they can decei@@ ve themselves of violent men .
I was convinced that I would never ever happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the misery by Carlos Vera .
without name to name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour has also been a form of failure .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ als would at least have had some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner took her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o called CRE@@ O ( &quot; I think &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of failure .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
you do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic mis@@ trust .
her wealthy partner she finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started to beat her .
Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against its former partner who developed into an un@@ manage@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly concerned about money , power and influence of their former Partners .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not apply .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of Mis@@ sh@@ and@@ ora is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill is discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ den@@ llas ( # Prin@@ ter ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os movement ( # Non @-@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law considers to explain Fem@@ izi@@ de to an independent crime continu@@ ance and pun@@ ish harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legislative text was changed in some points to also win the Members for the Law , the feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are p@@ iled , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and will be pun@@ ished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill is intended to cost the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedur@@ al costs which need to bear the victims of violence currently , if they just want to reimbur@@ se it and want a safe accommodation to abandon the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose : &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Paraguay , Mis@@ sh@@ land is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer regarded as something Nor@@ mal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who are wel@@ ded in view of these facts is guilty and contributes to the wron@@ g@@ ish perpetr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to report as long ad , until distr@@ action is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen sen@@ at . previously , parts of the law had been altered . however , among other things , a passage was cancelled , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the filing of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after prohibition of a newspaper continued to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; letter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Information Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the bot@@ tom@@ an newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one year ago , the om@@ bian authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage of corruption in the sult@@ an .
You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he dra@@ fted a imprisonment sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and raised in court , but were later released .
Oman was governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a stat@@ ute .
since then , he , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Ober@@ ster commander of the Armed Forces , Finance , Secretary of State , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ an is marked by the pers@@ istence efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists .
the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , also campa@@ ig@@ ners , campa@@ ig@@ ners , to express their views on public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was arrested , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties bound the hands of justice . &quot; in it , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the judges of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , to raise a sentence in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; output Az@@ am@@ n from 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Edi@@ ting Committee , was arrested and arrested by the ISS and upon his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy chief editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , who had been following Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is detention as chief editor .
the newspaper was closed at an in@@ definite time after the Minister of Information Minister had given the statement , that &quot; the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on each other , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 at the court in mas@@ kat , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and tried the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were condemned by other things because of the disorder of public order &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ grab@@ bing of the state &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ ha@@ j was also found guilty of the violation of an audience ban and embarrass@@ ment for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of detention and money stra@@ ining in the amount of 3000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year professional ban was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a sentence in the amount of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after the use of &quot; a Information Network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit was fixed at the level of 5000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released in prison on 22 August 2016 .
the appeal Court held Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after the prison sentence of his six @-@ month imprisonment sentence from the central prison . al @-@ ha@@ j is still in prison , where he dra@@ fted his sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Appe@@ al also emphasized the decision of the Ministry of Finance to conclude the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n re @-@ permit , the newspaper is looking at its attacks by the om@@ anic government .
on the 8th of January , the information ministers issued a directive with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister proved to be personally another directive , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the ministers introduced a further time against the decision of the appeal report , the publication of the paper .
the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where ever press freedom was injured in Oman .
for further violations , for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop their operation .
due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ ha@@ j the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the extensive injury of the press freedom .
the Golf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ bian authorities at :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go out of their work ;
3 . protect freedom of press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman prevent their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of failure , including judicial di@@ ik@@ anen , can exercise .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understandings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er 2016 in Zambia , figure is done with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in Africa . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for se@@ duc@@ ed medical research there are two reasons : for an absence of global health care , many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases like AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria combined in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , in building their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er is director of the centr@@ all@@ ab@@ ors in the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially at Louis@@ iana , later in Indiana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself was on HIV virus , before he decided to go home to support the sam@@ pled health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media over these research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . thereby , I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I also have a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
G@@ V : what are your opinion of the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being makers .
the solutions that we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here .
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it adequate ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the US and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how large is your opinion the potential for scientific research in Africa , where should it concentrate , and how can we support the development process ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer sciences , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit very much .
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa to Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed , things to do and the complicated access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here .
the system that journals can only be accessed by payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how to change &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers the global food production
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton rus@@ hed to the USA for the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only set by its own imagination and the question as many sal@@ ut@@ ations he can get limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he was therefore not able to use it further .
the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rotation or green leaf .
over the past few years , more such patents have been registered to more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts will ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ enn@@ ia old tradition , Mor@@ ton still grow a salad , but it now needs longer because his work is still growing steadily with more limitations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like being in a river a rock that I have to pump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to do that now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go to sal@@ ads too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stick to the court , no one can breed any more of a new sal@@ at@@ variety because all the features are already patented . &quot; he makes so good as possible and try to grow the ones he wants .
however , it is very careful however and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts from the International Space station ISS have bred red RÃ¶@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; green@@ house &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested if plants are grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software to provide alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was launched to make sure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called by Os@@ si , U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can use the seeds free of them .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed well and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders will only allow others to breed their seed to breed so their own varieties and it will not be immediate - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant pat@@ ernity or prescribed .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the em@@ eri@@ ated Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds also plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter , or only little by taking seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stressed that the &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified crops .
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , cor@@ es , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustainable vegetables that are offered in August and September 2016 . &quot; those who are offered good , locally and sustain@@ ably producing vegetables , should also know that the way that vegetables are cultivated , is threatened .
nutri@@ tionist without seed sound is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit to others to keep their seed well @-@ free . thus , in contrast , its action is to be patented , seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , since the available Gen@@ o@@ pool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is thus more always available , un@@ lawful .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive Director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with a genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property , making it available for plant breeders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat has been patented in an even bigger style as a salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are so bred that they have targeted their desired characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves as far as to those due to which they thri@@ ve into certain environments and threats like p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents . genetic variety is currently necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto @-@ spokes@@ woman recognises C@@ arly Sc@@ adu@@ to that genetic variety are generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four European banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company is set up for the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the intellectual property of other breeders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; da &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant var@@ ie@@ ties to promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result .
such protection does not impe@@ des innovations , but also promotes innovation by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait for a patent exp@@ iring , certainly no innovations .
and if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle already .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and must continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ e@@ ater@@ ies are not attractive for us .
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es in the concept of itself , plant characteristics : &quot; we did not really create the characteristics ourselves .
the plants form them out and as breeders have ultimately no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Carol de@@ ppe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breed a kind , grow also his own values in it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with big farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation , Her@@ bi@@ zi@@ de seeks to grow in his varieties of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very gent@@ leman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents , it create the most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .
the independent plant breeders Frank Mor@@ ton seeks in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders were driven by the leg@@ ality of plant pat@@ ernity of innovative , &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that are patented .
I always need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is protected 20 years ahead of competition with which one makes it very nice to me . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be leaders in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , is working together as a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional commercial plants , the center with farmers is working together and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for the bree@@ der differ from country to country , because the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be part of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declares that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it is directed against the current practice of the European patent application , the patents on conventional plants allowed .
however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to put the Patent Office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa to learn something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems is declared that the organization is currently a global alliance for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seed systems , scheduled for the planned next year of the official launch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity in the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid agencies such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published in it . it represents that farmers have the opportunity to engage in seeds , to exchange and improve seeds , so that a stable supply can be ensured with food .
in the report also stresses the importance of a diverse , local supply to seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that it will soon be recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
still the Egyptian authorities still unlock the content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts .
on the weekend of May 5 , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the W@@ Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about sel@@ ectively .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it sharp@@ ly critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the W@@ Network for Human Rights Information ab@@ rupt , in spite of this attack and the mo@@ ck of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which must adhere to its objective to un@@ cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it was never so difficult to pursue these goals , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI has never been so difficult to overcome the block and not give up . we insist on to continue our task .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 web pages , such as b@@ don@@ or the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar @-@ speaking network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he does not write in Egypt &apos;s web pages and media .
now the blog , which he set up to deal with the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , the provider with which Zi@@ adas blog is native , on the other hand , is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards during December 2013 , while he recorded the student &apos;s student and recorded a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ves around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the blocking of the government and reflected , what this means for him :
the , to unlock blogs is very old , however , has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ alities al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , so it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a sie@@ ge of sie@@ ge ; An arrest , a attempted murder , pre @-@ charge of the National Security Council , the blocking of blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked .
2 ) You have proven that I do not wrote in vain . in other words , my words have an effect , if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I took it to the post of articles to deal with the cens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ gs go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this erg@@ es technical tests on the networks of various internet service providers ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE documented the block@@ age of vendors , possible by orbit@@ ing inter@@ net@@ tle and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
on Monday , June 12th we noted , as the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
the situation is additionally wasted that the cens@@ ors are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which it can proceed before the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and whom will they attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the population will dispute .
the Brazilian army is in use in fav@@ elas in N@@ iter@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day for day we report newspapers in whole Brazil with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard theme .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ den second day is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ be Rob@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence can be reached in Rio to the highest level since 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are daily daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local paper .
for detailed reporting of violence in Rio @-@ known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; .
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision explained the paper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex @-@ proliferation , etc . all that happens from the civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio , is in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor in the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war jer@@ k in a country that does not recognise war at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that , according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 states , which are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we realize that a war is dis@@ course , if it is distor@@ ted , it can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; be used more than it ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira against it , to call the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for accountability in the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself has demonstrated - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and com@@ plac@@ ent neglect of public service .
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent spot in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil , according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per federal state , Rio is at number 16 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company of South America , empha@@ sizes such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , for years the security policy of the state .
these safety @-@ policy measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ ific@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police force and to maintain a unity permanently there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . for some years the U@@ PP , however , after several reports on sc@@ ic@@ anen and repression against the poor communities who should protect the newly @-@ made police unit , increasingly under bombing .
on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why the force in Rio does not comply with the Geneva Convention criteria - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
besides legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war draws serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this demands the state to use resources and paths that are typical for war . this includes the penetration into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with which a civil is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ir@@ ref@@ using balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the Advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organisation Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syrians in a state of sie@@ ge .
the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume it on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the mass@@ acre was practiced by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these have stood by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under sie@@ ge , which resulted to rely on local residents or rely on tunnels and check@@ points .
through long@@ lasting block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population .
in return , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the conventional , in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their dietary fi@@ ad@@ fast@@ ness makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the direc@@ ting of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we opted for cultivation of fungi , because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Le@@ ila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fought for three years , known this project and expressed his relief that it now gains more and more &quot; famili@@ arity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO Gh@@ ir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey a 125 family knowledge to the plant@@ ing of mushrooms so Dr. Le@@ ila is a Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 , but will continue until Monday , the 04 . September 2017 , continue to collect donations to Can@@ do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally produced fuel will be used to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Le@@ ila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
afterwards they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was achieved , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they are designed to have a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed to mushrooms anywhere in the East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Le@@ ila stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom stem from various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breach of the sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suff@@ iciency by using vinegar ( such as paper , tea , coff@@ ees , cardboard , etc ) for creating new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work homes .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and sie@@ ge becomes visible .
we want our experience to be inspired in crises areas and we can help humanity . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people were prot@@ ested on October 21st in many district capit@@ capit@@ ols in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were gra@@ ded in the north of Portugal .
two forty @-@ two people died and approximately 70 were violated as a result of the Wald@@ br@@ aries of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government had proclaimed a state of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the region of Gal@@ ic@@ ia in Spain , where there were 4 dead persons .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ out@@ breaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande is a similar tragedy , where it was through the fires of 64 deaths and over 200 injured .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest @-@ areas by satellite @-@ recordings , are burned alone in Portugal about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the Ernst of the situation : there is only a fire in 4 districts .
all Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017
some of Twitter users shared images :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the events :
the narrow tragedy ...
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighters by the state .
people asked why civil protection was unable to def@@ ec@@ ate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ eign , by the Bund of the farmers of Portugal explained the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything .
they did this Sunday somewhere : there are d@@ utz@@ ous reports of open streets that were enclosed by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits are questioned in con@@ ges@@ tures with high fire risk .
a far @-@ reaching proposal to the whale form , which the government had introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was made by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a de@@ duction of the law if the applicant led the means to self @-@ protection , that was an open back@@ door so that everything was built , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val leads in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus was pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made of slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this kind always spread further .
these issues have added that the website of civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants sought or tried to contact , affiliated to offline .
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ered the population with information : they used the own civil protection data with the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of fire@@ men and was postponed to this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : there was more than half a million access strikes .
even the founder asked for help :

the journey from the refugee from Afghanistan to the successful entrepren@@ eur

during one night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings that had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government , so Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair .
at this time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afgh@@ an istan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother said it back then , she knew she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy should break .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the locks .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara &apos;s dominating party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ soldier was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt prot@@ ection@@ able .
the Taliban in their hatred on the Haz@@ ara well @-@ known Taliban were getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again .
he worked for a few years in a coher@@ ence . the work was hard and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little salary , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed bags with mort@@ ar that were he@@ avier than he himself to earn their living .
at that time , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site , on which we worked on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services and no heating whatsoever . we found n@@ ylon sl@@ ats in front of the open windows so that we are not er@@ fr@@ y at night . &quot;
after four years A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k 2002 came to Italy .
some time it was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which divided twice a day with the need for needy .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for exp@@ ired asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that advance asylum seekers in the country are des@@ astrous .
the human rights organisation for Europe for Europe writes , the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center , if they officially launched a request for asylum - what may be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then , people who don &apos;t have money for an accommodation , either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road .
so erg@@ ing it also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ selfish lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate itself from these conditions soon .
after spending several years different work in construction , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while still a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ lim@@ p opened .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Be@@ h@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of director , Am@@ in Wah@@ id@@ i .
the film won the Venice City Award , which was already awarded the 24th of 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans company , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gna in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals are far enough beyond Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and retail , and aim back to the country that he had to leave out as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know that my people suffer .
I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ks plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; in this way they can sell their crop excess on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts , but in the end are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law , which considers that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users must be able to use the social networks within six months following a successful law enforcement , on the website of the authority under stating their full name as well as their expulsion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment , or the indign@@ ation of a criminal payment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was adver@@ tised by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there .
may , another deputy proposed a legislative proposal , in which har@@ dened pen@@ alties would be introduced for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials .
under Egyptian law the avoidance of the president as well as government institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law proposition , such a act would act with prison and money loans , right @-@ wing experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the fall of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) , which was arrested on 13 August 2013 , as he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup against the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 prot@@ esters were arrested , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in jail at a distance date .
