<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American films, have danced with American music, American authors read and operated his sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When 14 years old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fright reporter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnates who were the Supreme Court of judges who wanted to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">Free after Method Man, "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, everything else is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration had only reinforced for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming, that you can always be that you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very blackish love written about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how to deal with his impunity.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells us exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague expressed it, and publicly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latino, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes, which he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that ever reached by the party candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not get Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example, Professor Bill Silcock, director of journalism, the people from all over the world take up a deep believer man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "also Trumps Weltillustrative does not coincide with the Peter Bhatia, the current editor of" "" "Cincinnati Inquirer" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumping intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life long, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">Still it fits to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with patience and grace to me and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice has helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who are embodied by them are experiencing my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump pierced his way to the nominee Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpiece to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they all shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, I broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of which the majority who know are tuned for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that she has disappointed?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look differently than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (ft.).: as much as "reopening of the White against all other ethnicities," words from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as said the great Van Jones, has done exactly what America has done so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality, it is nonetheless a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is always welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as his president, twice the son of Kenianman whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "however, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the White America's white promise and says: hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the herds, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who liked in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a soundstrong "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" rocked the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "Latino has a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they responded.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they called them and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and soundproof" "" "NEIN" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God be thanks, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Country, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find space in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">That the music, which is played in both places, not only the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump only 16 odters south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an ancient colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds distant from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La Banda de MÃºsica (music bande) plays in the municipality: one out of children and adults of the existing Symphony Orchestra, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students is the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its drug abuse and bankruptcy.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and gave the youth so a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI are:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and play with shiny eyes and play in the trusting you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongo, and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located on the main garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay, capital - on instruments produced from re-made waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprepared instruments that consist of local firm waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled under direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez so began to transform parts of apostasy into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imittering violin, violas, celli, contrabasses, guitars, cords, trumpets, trombones, trombones, trombones, and percussion, all produced from the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire covers classical music, folk music, paraguayische and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article of the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez is a local ecologist and a musician for the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: a out of waste-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and that the project Orchestra is called.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentary called" "" "Landfill harmonic" "" "(harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical power to:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates around one billion tons of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Compfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from rubbish music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can be successfully fighting against illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fighting wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication is done as part of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operated in liberalanic waters illegal fishing, before looking for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly taken over and slightly tilted to welcome a foothold of this species on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they are refusing to make one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing violin.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister surrounded by countries that you simply" "" "refuted Kiilu" "", "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading clerk of the Kenyan Fisheries. he is part of a team who discovered the ship at the time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the pillage of the land.</seg>
<seg id="106">At the core of this initiative, criminal practices crosses and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NRO Stop illegally Fishing (Illegal fishing) was established.</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand up each other where it is about illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is inregulated by definition: what is caught, concealed, there is extremely difficult to detecting because of it is the illegal fishing a leading cause of overfishing by regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the intentional mistempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may harm that a delikates balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing were once replaced by bureaucratic hurdles and also by cutting-empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions now occur in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There the individual countries can communicate with each other, for example lists existing licenses, to divaporated activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open seas, using satellite channels.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in the botanical areas. also, so digested lanes discover - some such that suggests that a ship invites its captured fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly also if they have a criminal spirits.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing are based on this information then accepting such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their load. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing will be financially worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain valued 20 million USD to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i each year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate the East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages, present to the region commercial fishing from around the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Among other practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake licence papers, specification of fantasies, the fish protected species and fish in nature conservation.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically use the lack of international co-operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-seamless control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier a ship could be illegal and a country could not say" "" "you dared my harbour." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say 'Comm to me'." "" "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks, which had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has fleeing boats and found it.</seg>
<seg id="128">Thanks to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that should help FISH-i to give suspicious ships of precise locations.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which will always be further developed, also helps to track the illegal vessels that likes to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that we try to cross," says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, which they can no longer be used by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is helping build a system that connects different information levels with each other. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually take effect on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the marine protection organisation Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world market by means of each of the single foldable ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with neighbours to get a better idea of who is doing what is doing - this makes simply sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permissible the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals, but also deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who had previously confiscated without license and hardly expected to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries management, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia helped, Greko 1 retrace, the inspectors found there on board tuppnets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now also other countries" "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa a hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing every year." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "there are six countries together in 2015, to the so called West Africa Task Force." "" they now fight against illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "" "" safety is the goal of bringing more such initiatives and structures to other regions, "" "" says Copeland. "" "</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member land of Somalia could report his first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was released under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and have been used locks networks, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into the bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the Take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a particular, collaborative way to protect oceans actually works in the entire world ocean.

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to join the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As by now an adult man Quijano said in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated during the Argentinian military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the BÃ¼rde, the same name as his father carry up to the brutal military-perations in the prison of La Perla, which he watched at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">34 years later he retained the secret of the surname for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I was not able to realize that my father was a thief, Folterer and murderers.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerievements. during the Argentinian military dictatorship of 1974 to 1983, a time of state frozen, was his father from 1976 until 1978. commander of the secret services 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Filing.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressors, who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who realized during the years the scale of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy and who said before a Federal Tribunal against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent, and how this child has chosen for itself a way of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father began to take me to the military base, I often went with us into the sports hall. there I was rounded up with a boy who made combat sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father from him and a few days later he showed me a black-white photo and asked me to identify my friend about it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said,</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you were friends with one of the ERP</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they do not take you one day and I must save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito revolucionario del Pueblo, - revolutionists People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Labour Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">Therefore he offered me to go back to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would become a secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine. for so my Father had raised me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base, I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simple everything.</seg>
<seg id="228">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="229">'dah the prisoners are tortured</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he commanded me to increase. he led me to a baracke, in the cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - just all possible - were standing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything from that was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small in a blanket wrapped and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that it was a great lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the Baracke where the stolen items were dropped and subjected me with an alership.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I spined into and saw a couch that were tortured on the people.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fortified the one end of a cabinet. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely get a man with handcuffs on the bed, they poured him with water and pursued him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: ComisiÃ³n Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The rocks there in it was horrific... like a dirty wind.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately again and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked me, How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another?</seg>
<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me for the third time to work, he led me to the entrance of La cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated by handcuffs and bind them.</seg>
<seg id="250">"" "he spoke with" "" "Chubi" "" "Lopez (Jose LÃ³pez, a civilians who was also charged in the process) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cuadra." ""</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people with the face down - all were captivated by hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">Near the entrance caudal men silent on the mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="253">"" "when my father noted that I saw to the prisoners, he said," "" "What guckest thou so, Arshole?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">"" "" "" "why did you otherwise brought me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father talked about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">Besides La cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices.</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero hit a man there and kills.</seg>
<seg id="260">(according to indications of survivors the civil is Jorge Romero, which was also indicted in the La Perla-Ribera process, the students RaÃºl Mateo Molina to death).</seg>
<seg id="261">In the following video Emilio Fessia, head of the memorial La Perla, by the former Folder chambers.</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came here is also the way on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">If you look at the map you'll see that they took about this path and then tortured it for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="264">Here their names were altered and they were assigned as part of the process of dehumanization a number assigned.</seg>
<seg id="265">When they survived the torture, the prisoners were cast into the cuadra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be laid.</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shocking of men and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'War' mare</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"" "back then at the age I had no idea what the" "" "war-mare" "" "- as they called it - was." ""</seg>
<seg id="270">But when I was later on the military, I was in the gendarmerie - it was clear to me that war is a baonett or perhaps military-sign that one is fighting against an enemy.</seg>

<seg id="272">Archiving of the archival</seg>
<seg id="273">But if one walks into a house and the fridge, the record player, clothing, paintings, money... stilt, then that is not a war-mare but vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">I always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could be involved in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an Officer with Gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house and to steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my Father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">Once he called me a criminals and I said, and thou that you miss cars on the street?</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not criminals?</seg>
<seg id="281">He exploded anger, struck me and cried out:</seg>
<seg id="282">If you go so far, then I will find you and bring you hanging.</seg>
<seg id="283">We need no one else!</seg>
<seg id="284">So my father was.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no only good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">When I said in the trial, I showed a photo of that time I took a jacket and a roller pullover out of wool. both had my father from La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="287">We were not poor, but he still brought clothes at home.</seg>
<seg id="288">Back then I accused the defense to have been a co-conspirators in this crime. I resist, no problem, they can lay me the burden what they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="289">I was anyway there to tell.</seg>
<seg id="290">'The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominous act '</seg>
<seg id="291">Now, where I am older, I find remorse.</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. if you have children first, you recognize the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I was even so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">Well, you have executed people during the dictatorship. but what the corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kids dispensed?</seg>
<seg id="297">One day my father brought a girl to his house whose mother was killed.</seg>
<seg id="298">She was like our pet, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl.</seg>
<seg id="299">I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?</seg>
<seg id="300">They just could have put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people. but what their corpses disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom you could commit their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominous act that can be done to a human being.</seg>
<seg id="304">My father told me when democracy was introduced back, they used machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="305">They were smashed and somewhere entail - no idea where. "one will never find something," said My Father.</seg>
<seg id="306">But something of course remains always.</seg>
<seg id="307">'I have seen how you killed people! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The thought, to view my Father, was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I did not kill him because of all the atrocities that I had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="313">"" "then he suddenly said," "" "I don't know. I have not killed anyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="314">"" "" "" "I felt relaxed and asked me, what the whole exaggerated patriotism and the" "" "Western and Christian feelings" "", "which they allegedly defended, actually were good." ""</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried,</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me what to tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You have committed horrible crimes, and you have forced me as a child to participate.</seg>
<seg id="319">He resisted only "Na then put me on."</seg>
<seg id="320">Exactly that was what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I regenerated the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">Nobody can preach me that I am taken before. I finally said against my own father.</seg>

<seg id="351">The error was to the translator Julian Holmes, one of the inhabitants of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News made a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "terrible" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "horribly" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police there are the percentage of older drivers that are involved in accidents, but quite an occasion for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for instance, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>

<seg id="375">Photo of Flickr users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For overputting two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is in case of maternity. in general the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - mother language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">So to translate a French mother language, for example from English to French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as their native language, translations into English. this may lack an understanding of overcoming, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers, to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees, nevertheless leave firing internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English skills are made as the best to be done, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbrenen and puzzling sentences resulting from machine translation show that this technology can still not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages quite particularly.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which are often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be as jewelry yet acceptable or at least harmless. but from large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translation.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a serial source for its translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: protests and censors take on internet and television</seg>
<seg id="391">Mainpage of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Freies Adventure) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet user useless, they do not have access to the Vivoplay access to the online radio station Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later other users wrote that the internet pages of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also overthrew pictures of the protests in Caracas, who were organized by opposition groups, who oppose the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a Traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was dressed, and recommended the Users, VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant since 2014 during the 2014 report on protests. back then, the Commission of telecommunications would like to report on the demonstrations and lockings when they continue to report on demonstrations, as the Commission was calling this as a call for violence.

<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I have filed myself again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litre limonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEIT filtro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay has been inaccessible by a blocking of the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online stations. this also affects the website, on which the National Assembly resumes their meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous post-research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local internet provider will be able to use DNS. this is a technique, by which the DNS server requests from certain domains answer.</seg>
<seg id="406">When a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server answers or deny the request during the call to such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third channel, the transmission was set on Thursday, April 6th, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, which was transferred to the protests in Caracas, in custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police officers.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went again on shipment.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulated the Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans access to multi-media coverage about the current events in the country still further.</seg>

<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she started working as Criadita for the family. as criaditas, one refers to Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money outputs her inferior son or her inferior daughter to another, abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>

<seg id="425">This act as Criadazgo's practice is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduation, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - gathered records, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things on behalf of name, for the sense of gratitude, which is vaccinated the criaditas, guarantees in general unsilent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double delusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who complete her daughter in the belief that they are doing so their training to improve their position in society and "something out of itself" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that takes up the girl and justify its exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise not receive training, and perhaps even starving.</seg>

<seg id="443">She stressed that the assassinated child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations like UNICEF or Callescuela made deeply rooted in the paraguayischen company's practice of Criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They recorded the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came to protest and called for "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows as children are registered," defendant Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">With no papers it is much easier to injunpunished the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations demanded a breeding investigation into the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criadita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farmers in which their father worked, concise had to register and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go working and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets, to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">At the same time, it had to divide the time that you still remained time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up at five o'clock each morning and prepared breakfast for their employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Friday for example cleanse the fridge, putzed the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the ground.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at the end, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more they finished with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says, she had never been starving, but did not get unbounded food. "I was allowed to get more books out of the house of housekeeper than eating out of the fridge."</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the game Liberal Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">"" "on some evenings of the landlord Alvarenga, next to him and editorial from opposition newspapers such as" "" "sendero" "" "or" "" "El Pueblo" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to persuade them to give the official media reports on the regime of dictator no faith.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he held her for intelligent, but did not stand with her." "" "the landlord had found someone who heard, while he spoke about politics," "" "says it." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be able to learn" bad habits "there once again, that Alvarenga, who belongs to the Indigenous group of the Guarani, speak at home once again their mother tongue.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they had the formation they had made her to lose again, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="474">It was very clear, however, that it was for everything she got from them, paid with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also in school Alvarenga was discriminated against. "a thing about which almost never is spoken, harassment and the scicanen are exposed to those criaditas when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children parents have, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents, a criadita is.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to my home. I had no friends in school or neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time, where friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not one group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">Society cheapest the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="481">In January 2015, a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which you can share advertisements for cleaners and children's maid in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="482">The administration of the group is PEPA Kostianovsky, a town carrier in the Asuncion district.</seg>
<seg id="483">Hello! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="484">To learn.</seg>
<seg id="485">Please send you.</seg>
<seg id="486">Start from Monday, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="487">The ad received five "Likes" and many comments.</seg>
<seg id="488">A woman from the place Ãemby wrote that she would have had a two-year girl and gave her phone number.</seg>
<seg id="489">Another woman who also came from Ãemby offered her 15-year-old niece. "she likes small children and is very pretty," wrote them.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the third commentary was written by "a girl from the inland, who wants to work."</seg>
<seg id="491">Then the fiddle in the ad turned once again a:</seg>
<seg id="492">Dear friends, I have found a found. I look at the same time it works with her.</seg>
<seg id="493">Thank you, I write again, if something is.</seg>
<seg id="494">The business was completed.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the prolog to the report Criaditas, Â¿Hasta cuÃ¡ndo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criaditas, like long yet?), a collection of testimonies say former Criaditas, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery, CuÃ±adazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay, the Conquistadores), the Conquistadores (in which the workers had to be deported and Spanish indoctrination). therefore, it is not to justify that many girls and boys are going to engage in a system of slavery, where they will be easy victim for abuse and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="498">Social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Criadazgo.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months of adopting the law, users and users have to register with their correct names and personnel policy, in order to register social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If there is failed to do this, this could be a punishment from up to six months imprisonment, or to make money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill that consists of six paragraves and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defined social media as "jedwede application, which is running and used over the Internet, to communicate with others by means of voice, video and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced if the draft does not exist, as the draft authorities are unable to specify the user and users the registration. unclear is also how to make those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary delegates and sponsors of the legislative power, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password "to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to set a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of which it would be necessary for the Egyptian people and Egyptian to submit information to their identity to access the network.</seg>

<seg id="513">Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German "leadership research") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German "Egyptian initiative for personal rights"), told Global Voices:</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as they are violent by physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">When I take it seriously, this means that they are to set up a strong surveillance system to apply for citizens who apply a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it to a judicial process.</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must be discussed at the legislature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary session." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and enforcement shall be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in which the control is maximised and ensures that no softening narration on the surface is present," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">One subtype of the larger family of leopards that strike through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are due to Wilderei, the loss and the fragmentation of their habitat and since they find more and less prey.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this specific type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">Like Raza shows in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predators in the Kurdish ecosystem," and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also that a great prey beast is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopards actually in the wild way is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a large cat in the camera, Raza breaks down in pure joy.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from the Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still is the region to rebuild.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, documented in the northeast of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made during the past six years to rebuild the life of those who have been affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was a prefecture of Japan's northeastern which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring areas of Fukushima and Iwate have been forced out, because the tsunami had let whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Still, the Prehima prefecture of Fukushima still experienced a nuclear accident, already alone that 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Special Report of Kahoku Shimpo shows what progress has been achieved six years after the progress of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The construction situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwns</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo paper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (s), a total of 9 pieces, saigai kouei juutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate were finished.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures were made of Miyagi, and here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is the balance of Fukushima with 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, one always tries to move even six years after the disaster, evacuated by handhelpers (of the others, casetsu itutaku) into final spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in temporary shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwns in such terms.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of 2011 Evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated shelters, which after the disaster in distress, were settled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three concerned prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by unhappiness, their torches up to December 2016, which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of fisheries base in Iwate and Miyagi have now been in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing industry have resumed their operation at Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident, have been in co-ordinated in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic bomb is, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of arable land of Fukushima, are located in the" "" "nuclear zone" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered over and again, but again Fukushima remains far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The economy numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 per cent at the same level as before the misfortune. Fukushima on the other hand, however, can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants, it was harder to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a full picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the status of rebuilding and also how their empathy have changed towards the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of the article, the Kahoku Shimpo-Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey in order to bring more about the unami awareness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to be prepared for future earthquake and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it comes to those who had to evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has increasingly directed their attention to the position of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, catastrophenols, nuclear accident, which has ever had to experience Japan.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts were settled.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In disaster regions, most of the evacuated regions are still older than 50 years old. they have failed to compete for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people encounter people from other countries that speak another language, the differences appear to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, you often recognise that one more combines than it seems at first sight.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the Intensive station: last Friday he had defeated a police officer at GoiÃ¢nia with a tread against the head. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a protest against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the BundesuniversitÃ¤t GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-Hirn trauma and several fractures.</seg>

<seg id="603">If a police officer would be audited by a protesters and land on the intensive station, his face would be six months long in television and all the oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared by Luiz da Luz, divided the video on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officers and several Sanitary confines to him shortly afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all over Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The Municipality of Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the Western Cuban Province of Mayabeque, is widely known as el Central - to Spanish sugar mill - regardless of its fact that there is no noteworthy sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activity was laced in the sugar cane.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the rise, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory lost gradually and according to its facilities, until only the rumst of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to be reinvent.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some have changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resignes and commute daily to the factories, which still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who is up every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not kill his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, who are in operation after a long inactive time because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he didn't expected.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene reminds us of that in MaÃ±alI would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise has not been held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resist the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production was produced by 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country for a few decades, but the poor harvests have already been no new.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned out?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old train station of the church had already been better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to focus on production on the most efficient factories, the annual production plan was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nonetheless the sugar price grew again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos must remain a pound, according to the 2016 report "agricultural perspectives" by the OECD and the FAO, the Agriculture and Nutrition Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tons), the raw export business would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation came from a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane of Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene is known as a soldier, about the closing of the factory, the word that he is repeated the most, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">Thus the place is preserved, they formed a full time - working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first opening year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents that would only be removed from the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date differed.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. do they do by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour run mobile audio studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live exhibitions.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were managed by the educators David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop increases the young participants in conversation topics such as "cultural identity, language, analysis, love, self-acceptance," or whatever of them comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school'Na Aksa Gyilak'yoo in the territory of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, explains the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section of Westkanada on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases have been largely unresolved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, despite influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the refrain is sung on Cream.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group that gave them a strophe in the dialect of Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebookout of N'we Jinan, the Stanzhe is available in transcript, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever care for me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports, foreign and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the losmishes and transmissions regularly appear in statistics. however, these reflect not at all the extent of the human tragedies that this fight against itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the head of the Sinaloa-Karting, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind every corpse, behind every bone loss in the hundreds of pavements, the stories of innumerable parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds might never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico declared the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco." (German: "with drug trafficking, said to give these victims a voice and stories of people told that in the struggle between the prosecutor and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, if businesses close because they are threatened by drug retailers and whole communities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que cambian por el miedo" (German: "as fear life") tells us exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">One of the main character is Guadalupe, a father, who has kept secret tombs after his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost their father and two sisters in just one day, her husband and two sisters.</seg>

<seg id="777">KYHB, a Leserin by Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this post by Taxco, at the state of Guerrero in central mexico.</seg>

<seg id="779">Disease and Sensational journalism I have been known for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come over every day of newspaper kiosks and see the title pages with images, which actually can only be derived from a textbook for criminals or from Ats of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the singular or sadly it is sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants Narco (German: drug dealers) will be when he is great. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of the offenders if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is like those who have lost someone who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happened to them too.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inelessness of human beings is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified that they were" "" "sincere" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to speak, that they will be spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirred and quiet.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of extortion in the main urban district." in this it describes how armed crimes were put away from their business until they end up not only the business but also destroyed their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never dies, the trauma remains, the fear comes back high, if you are alone.</seg>

<seg id="796">It included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, for you don't know when they perform or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my deep-rooted feelings, but the reply is no, because I forgot how to crying. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article "The forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence written by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions on how: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was assassinated by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicity?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a guard and he tells you to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the surface with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother was gone.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood has been past two years before, when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home, who saw bloody crimes of his father, which was shot by armed men from a squandering car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">In 2006 Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was organised by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders for public security and government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone the prosecutor 3103 Morde. this is equivalent to cut 8.5 Morden per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands who are organised crime in Mexico and invading the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only few stories live in view of getting new headlines. this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to tortured the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country in the last four decades, in intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the years after something the first time surfaced? content in social media, no matter whether true or untrue, tends to continue to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it was misleading to use tragedies which actually have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">These false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - deny not the fact that there are abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our longing for images on messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank-wagons crossed the place of Sange in the east of DR Congo, kippes and exploded. there were 230 people came to life.</seg>

<seg id="833">It shows rows of shorthated body that irritate on the ground while persons they look at.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not find its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years the same photo was falsified several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not related to related tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram had attacked the Nigerian towns Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported dramatically from atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops have been burnt down and corpse in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained back to count corpses," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were smashed, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only by satellite images could be displayed the following times.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack remained unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt of the Boko Haram, to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again, as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">You are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">You are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this missive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failures; Africa check has documented orders for Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all of these cases the picture was presented as a testament for massages.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments like this example, the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture from Sange occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message, published by the United Nations who could flee strokes, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported from violence against the Rohingya, Posts like the following address that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This photo comes from a saudi-Arab news page that ended in 2012, the President Myanmars Tha being said, monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she used the picture from the DR Congo to besee this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that these Posts go through. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murder of Christians by Muslims or - to defend the Muslim - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underestimated compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how pictures in connection with these efforts are used.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe in these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who have unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggesting this mood of mis- and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowns it the real Greys of what actually happened in the DR Congo, in Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that keeping the back of images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images readers and viewers desensitise and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work on it to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, it is the fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "Technologists experiment, because with algorithms to support the fight against" "" "Fake News" "". "you will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image can be suggesting, which actually may be used either from the context or completely miscreed type." ""</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (eg. unreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in each language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unusable words are already well known (such as the famous Portuguese suction) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobakesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But everyone resist stubbornly with every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, why a full explanation and sometimes something context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, during the author and linguist from "Untranslatable" Steven Bird chose to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find for example words from the VAT language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Bemush you with your parents in recognition of how to strive for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in Hunscreen language that are spoken in parts of Brazil as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The convenience or laziness that you feel after spending cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They escaped other cultures, revealing other ideas and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site would like to publish more of these "insurable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the "Treasure Languages," which are very appreciated by Untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barriers?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the umeration of stories in their original language is a possible response to it.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Unnamed blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written basis, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already performed events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to children.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project are valid:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass dying of the languages of the world may be avoided when we create cities, assume diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "while listening often is often associated to understand" "" "these events instead" "" "listen to the listings to appreciate, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storyteller puts its history first in its own language and then translate them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional trainer, so lead their devotion and their representation to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions that the language no longer be a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storytellers Rassidatou Konate is also the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative for their land.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of the hares and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After having explained the importance of his Fabel, John Nyamusara was asked, "How did it speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a wide ditch he shares his sense of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have heard!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were very with me!</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been mixed for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's: publica, the annual conference dedicated to the digital culture that is oriented in Berlin, dedicated a meeting of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the German based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' published books within three to five days, lases excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Indies (The cost of freedom: a collective neighbour).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was released last year and here license is available, contains a number of approaches that deal with free culture in the face of repression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction there is:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss as movements for Freies knowledge and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for Freies have been working on page to look over the fog that surrounds our newsletters and to create something from our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted from the Abdra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information on his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice which are pushing for his release, and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let's start thinking about their own destinates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What have we decided?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of timeless extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Webdeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in the detention of governmental authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel reported on the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military proceedings from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported to be contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad administration and realized it from a alleged death penalty against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and state remain unknown but still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project built in Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes are predictive than the work that he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the passing cross of many civilizations and here merging Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and persican influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put everything to it, this architecture, which not only empowers the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip, into the digital archaeology and conservation has created a period of time that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel was not yet able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom and bait taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read English well, write and speak.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each one who asked him. he taught other incarnate, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought the internet to me.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He has also attached other incarnate how to use computers, at least theoretically, without having kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Warten), a Prosabine, which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She pushes the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arab into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is license-free.</seg>

<seg id="1226">The book is devoted to public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here an excerpt from the book of Nora with the title "It happens":</seg>
<seg id="1228">It is happening on every visit,</seg>
<seg id="1229">That I was vershadowed in the world of your charming eyes,</seg>
<seg id="1230">That I loose the meditation in the moment we embrace.</seg>
<seg id="1231">That each of the dangers is no matter,</seg>
<seg id="1232">Each of the fences, bonds and watchmen</seg>

<seg id="1239">To bring all the moments back,</seg>
<seg id="1240">And about your absence of cry and smile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I persuade myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bassel wrote Ghazi:</seg>
<seg id="1243">A year passes, my soul</seg>

<seg id="1245">I am in your cage,</seg>
<seg id="1246">And you are still in the cage of monsters</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights) has disappeared more than 65,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, Amnesty International has died at least 17.723 Syrians.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people are unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for release of Bassel for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We reiterate our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: due to corruption traversed director after the arrest of his sentence again to previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mosambique reacted with anger to a corrupt, in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, which was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison along with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mosambique airports, whose council stood Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately asked his resattitude to the company, which happened on April 19 then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Assembly of the Republic, which failed to apply the motion, there would be no obstacles for Cambaza to return his old post as the company was not disciplined after his custody.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not know the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated de PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re-charge the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">Represents the lack of transparency in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step forward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP.</seg>
<seg id="1263">"" "" "" "what we take note is that also the company should have led a disciplinary procedure against the resistance movement." ""</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company contradicts, however, and prompted no adequate legal steps to use the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mosambique social media, this behaviour also rejects the case as" "" "reluctance" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence and had half of them.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could keep lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company he helped damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza will be gladly paid for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Reluctably!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young muslim, and student of Political Science in Brazil, says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza from the state rewards because he insulted him, I can not believe that someone was rewarded with so massively in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is missing to return to morality and serve the state, * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as the handele it was an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre-loaded and sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to information from Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known sociale network took its posts from the net, because they played the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although over the origin of the word it is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindit origin or generally used as an adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or the others (in burmesic Scriptures) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements gave the word an extreme abideation connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically calling from hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in order to express their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore, there are several burial words with a different meanings that have the same letter such as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written on Burmically also 'Kalar htaing', as well as other words such as' Kalar PAE '(spage),' Kalar oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooker Aung Kaung Myat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends on spiritual ways, if she knew how he can relieve his back pain by making a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + das Frageword (la) in Burmically - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radicalised nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical, before it was all Posts, which spread in suspicion, racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyze the mail carefully and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example" "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar PAE" "" "(gap between)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-story nationalists who disseminate hate speech, received a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to cutting their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords often become a Katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply to start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends only that the word 'Kalar' was banned from social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new directive of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the lifts, post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post "Facebook community standards not dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radicalised nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, who has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have been doing more about the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community to ask for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but this doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it appears as if they have started this without local context or technical assistance, and as words as "chair" or "peas curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they didn't attempted to amend the falsibly dissolved Posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits, they would have great revenue, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of proach among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users become aware of Facebook funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook Posts who had no hate speech, but nevertheless they were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmical text reads, "I want to sit on a chair and watch an Indian movie and watch an Indian movie.</seg>

<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>

<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously decided to ban a law that is supposed to ban this practice, so that the old age is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Prior to this change in the marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were firm on the practice, and in May 2016, the leaders of the interreligious organization (IRO), a group of representatives of the different religious groups of the country gathered that the state cannot interfere with, since that, age, not the ripe. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "" "" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is an authorized partner of the UN's rights Convention, the minors" "" "minors" "", "defined every person under 18 years of age." ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics from the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married with 15, in Trinidad and Tobago were 2.8 percent, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical central office of the country, that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online Petitions and social media movements that were committed to dismantle laws to children's before, followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no concerns about telling the critics of children before, they should, who still take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This sort of religious opposition sort of tension in this actually complicless cause, and at some point there were doubts on whether the opposition would correspond to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in the beginning of 2017 the draft bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which meant to be discussed at the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and proclaim the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators announced on Facebook a status update, which lesion-Ann Boiselle was posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill of law against the children before was elected in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for this and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having decided earlier in the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media users had been enthralled because the laws for the children's before finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member of Lovell Francis, who suffered a ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has so much time and unnecessary talk, used to worsen the core of the matter, but do you know what? the monogamy before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago now, and that is worth every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of the opinion was, it was definitely long enough to manage the practice, Lara Quentre Thomas overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook of Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which implies:,, Excellent News!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group, who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The most popular age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the population of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the amendment of the German law was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">In the House of Representatives, there are 41 members and of which were 35 present during the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All members, who were against, have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The monopolies in Trinidad and Tobago are no longer permitted by law.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our members.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">"" "" "" "many months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to be able to engage his promises." ""</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the general prosecutor Paris Al rawi, a supporter of the law said it is quite legitimate if Maharaj would go against the law they wished for most social media users, one would approach the debate on the subject matter.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, when we, instead of discussing the discussion so general, in a way that only panic and innocuing can give rise to the fact that the state, our daughters to protect them that they might be beneficial to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's before in different gradations are legal or continue to be the norm, although there are laws that they fail.</seg>

<seg id="1390">Through the mirrors of web pages, Turkish users can see another Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, reciprocally to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the USA, internationally darkelt.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey unraged the popular and crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes more evident how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporter and fans of TV-series repel off against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although a lot of technical use Internet users are used to use convergence tools for block-block websites (a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been written by Wikipedia, just as recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been adopted since 2007, after the Internet law was adopted (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the third-known country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain locked, there are now several Mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System) than the Platform all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralised peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine-host connections), which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is now available in spite of the legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">Since we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia) we put everything on it, snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read content on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also gave that this step is done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirroristen from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to hollow similar mirrors when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices, as well as staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Farm "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy address, a mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One access a different URL that is not the original one. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then when these are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he saw around him, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated himself was a camera to wear and try to deal with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar attempts to bring Nepal to the international scene at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his homeland is right next to the Chitwan National Park, offering it the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that direct attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook as this will help him first-class position in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wild photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father, that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran out with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood tigers already from face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can be bothered by the opinion of the sheep not in sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I was back home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately drew up, we look at and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for Children" (lit.: I clicked on environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Nepalese and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otdia National Park recordings of Otters. up to 12 days lasted until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was once again published as part of a Content-sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women are avoiding the greatest care of speaking the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect her husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences should they abuse the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by an Indian state Odisha by a manor and rejected by her family and the community of the village, after having married a married relative with name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of their wives also did not name the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less slicences to fear, if at all, they should not come out of this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health guards as well as housewives, a unique club, and were thus fast becoming the main navigation theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs that exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is committed to the reduction of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pahas been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to uncover practices, such as children's heating up to the exiting of HIV- and AIDS infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassesses of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that showed the Rohini in its discussion round, was of women who do not name their husbands in the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem which women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To pronounce the name of their husbands, there is a Bring, which they all must be paid and never put into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this as a cheque, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition has been deeply rooted in so deeply that we have never thought about this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, which had never mentioned her husband in the name before, at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband shrinkly long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Internash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name it from now on by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started its first discussion board.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that there was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the issue in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the videoprojection the women tried to put the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of her husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in the promised women to never speak the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she died during the whole exercise just ahead of himself; another decided to allow the whole gestating frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin talking about, with an old Bruns broken, the women decided that they would actually try their husbands to name their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini was given a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she starred, she was afraid and said it was an error.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arose in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the carcinberred point on the forehead, which shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband, that I would wear the galvanized Red Point, if he also kicking it.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughs only and I listened to him to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely so, but think they are now in a better position, even to choose him not to bear in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion will be a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we are doing a trip at any discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what could hear" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months, she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; they danced and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these issues for so many years and yet I have spoken about some things, such as our identities on our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things according to say, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of this is okay, but some wanted a Salwas-Kurta, a wide hemd over a pants, wear; they did not trust.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-election, morals linked to the Saris and much more, the Rohini her own couple of Kurtas (Upper shirts) into a discussion round, so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can carry jeans and Rohini is certain that they will be able to create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion, have already changed, Rohini, that things are slowly coming into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of her husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and are not a different family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in discussion will know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the feed for more freedom of movement or their own clothes-election - at the end of a difficult to navigating the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club everyone gives us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not just limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and reported to other people what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which probably has recently been made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of detained Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to the hospital for liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" after the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto, which calls for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has described Lius" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a spokesman, he said it as" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to call up calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet, Liu Xia, freeing or allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely widened on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised several responses from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the High Commissar of the United Nations for Human Rights, met by the end of June Chinese officials in order to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment if the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Liu abroad to be a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway took the shock, after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government expressed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon-headed by China since 2010, since 2010 the exports were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Once the message had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee brought his hope for a unconditional release to expression and lud Liu to pick his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of its imprisonment, he was not able to counter its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6, the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was requested to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leaders of the EU, Federica Mogherini, called for the release of Lius on how to participate in a statement on 30 June</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr Lius married as well as family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all the visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "us Ambassador Terry Branstad said that the Americans" "" "wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad, in so far it helped him in his convalescence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary and Polley, announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the message submitted to Chinese authorities, not only Liu freizers, but also to liberate his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The invitation from the US Embassy moved a furious response from China after itself, with the exterior of the State Department, that "no country has the right to interfere with an unanswered and irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley shared with that China should offer the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as travelling freedom and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled to Chinese constitution and legal systems, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push Liu and his wife conditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20, in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vortex could be overshadowed by Liu to visit Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28th, the Canadian ambassador John McCallum China urged to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to make sure of his family make sure.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP previously told that Lius wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is Liu not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada is calling for China to uphold his international human rights obligations, including free speech, true and responsible for the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">French Foreign Affairs called for China in a statement on 29 June on, Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all treatments which he, regardless of where, requires. furthermore, his wife and family can contact him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news station France info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, there was no further information that France will not pick up for any further information whether France will eventually take him.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">"" "" "" "the Council of the festive affairs in Taiwan called on 27 June on 27 June, Liu freizers and a greater tolerance for those who use the peaceful means to challenge political reforms and democratic development." ""</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu by the ruling Democratic Party Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to treat themselves in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed himself very concerned in a statement on 28 June by Liu and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Lius wellbeing.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my belief that the initiatives that he took and for which he had been rigorously punished, led to a harmonising, stable and affluent China, which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged as I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens are inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the charter 08 signed, which stands for democracy, freedom and the rule of law in China.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmuggling, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting, during a meeting of the international branches of the Chamber of Lawyers of the State New York, the Ministers noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, because they are compared to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore as a city should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we were different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to rotate "the logic," to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable country, we can say that we will ultimately be no land.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight from the responsibilities, a mandatory injury.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my land, eat land it is then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons for Shanghost were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given that, it appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, it defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the topic, the good old lyre appears from authoritarian rulers to be present, leave the twisted logic, as it adapts better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end-effect, the answers to his American guests were given the answers to his American guests in regard to our press, our itative, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarmaths he with non-answers to rational species.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanghness to clear his opinion as it did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, it is a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmuggling the effort to get up this point if he was paid high in order to be part of the city of Singapur.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he pointed to the reviews that one should begin to read the full address of the conference, so that one could understand the context of the memorandum of Shanmuggling better according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the wording.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore is so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He died in Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party win for decades).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is no country," "" "he obviously meant it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan presents his disappointment about Shanmuggling, who is a leader of a growing generation, such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore has said,...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew by Lee Kuan Yew, and the members of the old brigade, which I expected - do I agree with them or not, but this is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmuggling, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The new part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question which is asked for me in Japan is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1744">Depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is regarded as polite to show interest in his interlocutors by putting personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">On my clear position then follow the default answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly in anger, when they are held for Americans, but don't bother me that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag to their backpack if they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and the 11th of September.</seg>

<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp. "</seg>
<seg id="1768">First: as a "nice" to be referred to, is basically, mirror-hard, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from 'The Simpsons' (who has one's own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada would really be a nation of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing in which you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless, means unobtrusive and uninteresting to be and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, remotely from the things around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go as far as to say, that the desire to be free and alone, is a prime minister of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own issues.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders as "nice" is perhaps just cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We are lacking the warm, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) then Justin Trudeau joined the stage to show that Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop band has released a music video, which took over the junta, which took power in 2014 and restore the civil government in spite of its pledge the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phasty Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which rules makes him his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly politically, the music video refers to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days, this was divided by Facebook uploaded video 1.254 times and received 8.800 liqueurs.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, the Charlie-Chaplin-Video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activist challenged the public to look at this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, inspecial about how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persisted in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" 44 "" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the drain section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the commander of the army absolute decision-making through important national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "changing your attitude" refers to the notorious program for the "imagination" of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are regarded by the junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to be responsible for activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit has been set up in the army, supervised by online content and individuals who accused, the monarchy will be denied.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is set a strife against "Lese Majeste" (MajestÃ¤tseirist).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war was set out in Thailand.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia-Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">Now it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian-war war has officially ended, but its fools are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The deserted villages of the northern district in Tkuarchal show striking images.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchilava are located in the carbon basin of Abchasien.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, weakly, Georgians, and Armenians lived and worked together to sojourn in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and chases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also named in AbchAsia as well as Geisterium.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011 the total population of 16,000 people since 2011 was hardly ever risen by a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral-pink brillencirclell and goldcolored earrings in Teddy bears-form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born there and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama's.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has rather no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2,50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with kole, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - still hundreds of African and Haiti immigrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms RamÃ­rez tells people in full minibuses and from the top of the coast to call it: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It wants to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medication they can not pay them, they smiled them with a balm that had exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mommy Africa had an appropriate nickname for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children again.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and move toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other guides from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and Africans often travel together the route and that Africans are already talking on Whatsapp from Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">As many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before in Brazil and worked as a construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest in Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the Busticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>

<seg id="1933">She declares that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have given them to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">In this winter, Valencia and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the Bustickets are sold to numerous African migrants to be expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar per night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly shark.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking location outside.</seg>

<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled with his wife and three children before men who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, a single-known, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Some months later the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>

<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers also consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that their house is full, but it is also nostalgic, because of those that have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she is fed in her album with numerous photos.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users at the Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a cell notification in which it indicates the District government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, the app is said to prevent access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities use the app to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 h-h women in the autonomous Ili prefecture were arrested, because they had installed the app, just after they had replaced the app, with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, that the app would determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and follow, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, pictures, ebooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective power supply with System-categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blocking pornography web pages, from online cheating, trojaners and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control your own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors should help the children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these features can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers can manipulate the home network of a person or steal it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often grimmer for those who live in remote, depressed ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routinely Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Based on Twitter based media oulet "images from the China" (of the modulus of modulus), the censored messages published in China showed photos by a checkpoint, on which policemen the inhabitants indiscriminate then if they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they might be detained by up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city's party Council to minimize the proliferation of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and the related institutions including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when running their computers and communications devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current report from Freedom House, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs, to the 1st of August its "personal ID maps, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards to register with local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos" and destroy them. however, this action does not violate the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible approaches, including those that relate to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordan Rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends the majority of his time inside; sometimes he strove to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine lips to discover.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which had heard them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks her old proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of the Syrian Arab world, however, it also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only rich in their hometown Amman Relevanz but also in cities that are rich in Syria through to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With its 25 years Hdaib sees itself as a person who is not restricted in his mind by limits, and can be according to his own statement with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he grants a special discredit against the US American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas, something to do with his identity as "Palestinian flowed - even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine yet.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think of my own circumstances," "" "stressed Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think so because I am a man, while in water redeemed NescafÃ© in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law of the law also states that the public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do with protest against Islam on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sleeves are loud coffee and the swear of Kent cigars in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky above all when you have a look into the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, you have to do it easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan of water to drink, in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior of Jordaniens has told a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary groups, supporting the Islamic action front - the jordian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontal-singer Hamed sensuo, the cultural and traditional norms of the country contradicts and the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press conference in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was said "just" because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many say in addition, the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that questioned the well-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the whole region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the jordian people as" "" "progressive supporter of human rights" "", "which is continuing to employ" "" "for intellectual and cultural pluralism." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement is likely to be simply not simply-to-face rhetoric but in fact a more clearly marked-crystalline reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional Gender Standards zu Leibe, adding his vision of the fate of Arab women to have presiding sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a apparently crushed unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of "volunteers" - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Human Rights Watch claimed its climax in 2016. however, the number of volunteers reached its climax in 2016; however, it still appears that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure in order to support women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law for crimes against crime from 1954, women, who are exposed to risk of infamiless violence, "and for their release, is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy back on issues that are long as taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically, but doesn't matter that he's his music, the full explicit beginnings of sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man.</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "he became a policy of politics" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "is the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are politically active in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which man, in his words, "what you want," be faith or non-faith, heterosexuality or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that barely any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were deeply censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordian online programme Roya, to later note that his comments were torn away from the context, interwoven and his opinion was censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib openly acquires Hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, still remains in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work later on behalf of the potassies, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanian not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the jordal intelligence service took several former government officials and members of the teaching network, with the grounds that they have expressed criticism in social media critical to the problems that are deeply rooted with deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Given that the concert Hdaibs views only the tip of the iceberg - the actual challenge is to make a structural change within the next generation of the Jordanian.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has promised Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks slower, cautious and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is shaping up with music, art and literature on a true and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streamed unitions and in artificial ways of making guided democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is done, Hdaib will continue to overlap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These large, extravagant warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding origin of Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">You suspect that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory implies that the Festing, drummers and dancing over more than one thousand years have been handed over and from a time, in the armies of Japan marched in the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to pick up a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A joint center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition to Wa no Akari (literally tl).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I looked at the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two forts are just visible.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only True and a stunning way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18 meter high feast was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sports enthusiasts such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more standardization into the experienced hands of hairdressers that can provide these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity even has inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the Beitrags" "" "commandment to guerrilla warfare" "", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important, people who feel themselves louder, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question was the two young Colombian activists from the foundation of BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation not more from the head and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la RepresaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write letters to write guerrilla letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was the place of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "" "" "international was considered as significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">But in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and, around the clock their arms were carried out, now they must now be integrated into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeply hatred towards the guerrilla war, then they must record them into their ranks and support them in the creation of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: up to now, thousands of young people have written letters - commandment to former guerrilla war to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare, which then shall be given to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡, in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"" "" "" "this stated that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much needed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plane, he told he continued to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent advice.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to build up a new life. "letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story about a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters were collected within the framework of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19th in one of the UN Camp in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javerified in Cali, two of the members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation BogotArt traveled in the camp to transmit the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC put themselves on how they had done it earlier in order to counter the precepts of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters of undermining people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very busy moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political knowledge-student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a employee of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we had given the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla fighter.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut, in which the guerilla live) saw, I saw a guerrilla war that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I had to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the rest of the tube.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "anyway I spoke to him and asked," "" "hello, what do they do?" he answered, "" "" I responded to a letter I wrote to me. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone has written something so nice, so I responded to it. "" "" "" "" I suddenly saw the tears about the cheeks. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of war, I was tired to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and wanted to help him to write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and took the FARC already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice through the state had to develop into the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">For a purpose of this scale it is worth overcoming all obstacles, "said one of them.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who have never found hearing before and no election right, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful emotions that were reversed by their circumstances and environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me sore.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much harm to teach us something and a smile can give us a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian has been prophesied that after the drainage for peace prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">This is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to attack weapons and protest to their rights. and that is also totally justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we from the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">Therefore, we call on all defender of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they hear - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring victims, because we know from our own experience, that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2248">The first report was published by the journalist Elena Milakina in the Nowaya Gaseta; she threw a light on the methods of the Chechnyan authorities, the suspected queer men, and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a Monster to the World"</seg>
<seg id="2250">Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grosny and grew there.</seg>
<seg id="2251">Already since her childhood she felt that she was in fact a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2252">When they grow up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for them, why she moved to Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="2253">After a group of Cheetschenen had experienced by the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened at Sabrina.</seg>
<seg id="2254">It is out of fear for her life and ultimately moved them to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that someone took my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">It was a familiar from Dagestan, a transwoman who put into trouble in trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2258">She had no money, so I didn't hesitate to delay it without hesitation.</seg>
<seg id="2259">While I tried to help her, she was a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet, with my telephone number and a picture of mine. he sent them to his Chechnyan friends, with the following news: "then there are no men more in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents made by the whole WhatsApp the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I just got to show a few shopping spots from the backseat of my car, I heard a men say: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned into my body, I sensed something in my body, but I did nothing hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard one sentence, but this time on the Chechen:" "" "how long do you want the family to be," "" "thou scandstain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know that there was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was flown.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two keyboards in my right lungs.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: what kind of health did you put - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there's still my male name, but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office, I got it with fear; it was a Muslim, a caudal name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded me back to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They presented absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by going up without the streets; others wanted me not changed in the official TV in Grosny and say that I did not change my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body-size C - what should I say in television?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to handle this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">They said to her, "You have brought a Monster to the World not only your family, but the whole of the republic.</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she put a strick around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into a flat and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with dark windows and a numeric plate with a 95 drone.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After the third time it happened, it was clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends audited the numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flown?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to disclose their names, but I will say that I remember they all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mum as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without having to register without reading, without proof of everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it in the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you do not think about you, just because you leave the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you stakest. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it's: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you get in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "" "" "however, we do not talk about gender equality, but that is a tabutopic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish I wish, this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually give me trouble how to watch the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was eating one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no man were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So that my I, they probably invite you to relatives, these will take care of the problem with the person affected and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men stored in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says, there would be not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all those who have no rich relatives, or who were dropped by their relatives to ask Kadyrows court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they will be held there so that they can present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "" "" "say," "" "should they be reversed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked either any village or a military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged to radicalize himself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a mutation or do you have a source of this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has since been nothing new from them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was by himself when these people were involved.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, they were not presented as bandits, there have been no reports yet. we suspect such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if this persecutions and kidnappings of people who have been listening to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation, have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair for long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think before 2003 I was already familiar to Grosny as I still lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia was originally intended to approach the" "" "civil isation" "", "but ultimately came back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were tortured, I had colored eyelashes, carried rohrenjeans and short Tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the sharia never stirred me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnyan language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spake not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says to children if people make themselves funny.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed, you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to talk about morality in the TV.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us, but above the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people of the town began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Anyone who suffered and laughed before, viewed you on once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic is steadily worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you proceed now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't have a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">I am still working as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacup, connections, I accompany them to the hospital and helping them to get foodle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no penny for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I flew away from hiding place.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So is nature that has nothing to do with religion at all.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Cheetschenen, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no pigs.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have who, the Cabal have, the Russians, and which; on the whole planet there are - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear about what to hear.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many thinking about Transidentity to men who love men and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truction.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be accurate, different lifestyles.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I will be here as personal, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>

<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab ancestors living in Iran, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">In a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was an mainly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi Monarchy assumed power and undertook great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy all over Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran-coming oil and gas fields, as well as some of the most common and most valuable utility areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population gets a little bit of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and hardships.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime declined to the Ahwazi Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of lambs, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian regions, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These lambs have only led to worsen the devastation in the region through drying, and devastate local farming as well as fish and palms industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi-young people rose to 81% now.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director of cooperation, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, finished school, 55% a further school and 45% have a university degrees.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices, that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high increase" of the number of self-murder among young ancestors of the Nazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Kenimi said that especially the unemployment has become worse recently. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahwaz, new ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the creation process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not prefers Arab labor force, the local Arab Ahwazi takes access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside of their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their suburbs and names to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and become so attached, because even the Arab names in the workplace will not be tolerated, refutable because the speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances that the Arab ancestors had to endure, human rights activists alarm, before the situation is explosive.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions where many different positions have been expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">If I say that I am not feminist, many women - in particular white women, who call themselves as an intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, that women today still earn less money in spite of equal education than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come to a single ceiling, and that discrimination on the grounds of sex are still moving across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am talking about twice and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to talk on skin color, on racism, on black CIS women, on black transient women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I speak, on which kind we have been physically, mentally and verbal, both in and outside the feminist movement, decide to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But nevertheless all agree that women - all women - should come together to raise "their voices and" Kumbaya, my lord 'to sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk that there are in addition to sexualized violence an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women in two times.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and home countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls are referred to more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence suffer from a higher risk of suffering, domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want that all men, all men and all men have the same rights at all. on the other hand, I can't connect to a movement as a black woman whose center is the white woman who refuse to refer to the gender and the skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist spheres, who repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner mourned 1851 in her speech:" "" "I am not a woman?" "" "and I also refused to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is a human and marginalised essence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to connect myself groupings that also absorb our customs and customs in order to drive its egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to reach white women the importance of the excess of skin color and gender. for some of them continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to make them become a better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Even though the intersectional feminism was founded to give women from different homes a home and deviate themselves from the white feminism, is still the word "feminism" in his name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself fully and completely from feminism and to join me the movement of Womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather that persisted for a white feminist paradigm so that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it's more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: as we can defend ourselves in this way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will call immediately separatism and exclusion, after having read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I existed.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I'm recognized because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life neither passed, nor ignored, nor is rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and processed version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by Kurdish. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# Christmas-einefrubin) which reported on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commentar said Ada BÃ¡ez, that they have nothing against Luis Balbuena, their Expartners, who had become violent to him for violent.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship had passed some time and the police said, her statement would be placed to the acts, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When a further wife Balbuena showed for Misshiration, also useful the acoustic display of Ada BÃ¡ez nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second wife moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women do not even refund, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also dependent on the men that they misshout. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence, sign the victims of violence at all.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhaling 1 beats and Statistical 2 Unvisible Misshandals and a legal system, which do not subjuginal 3 Paraguays laws: good approach, faulty realisation of punches and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is hard to determine how many women are really misshandled, Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports that not even ansatzweise the extent of the gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," explains them.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015 at the District stadium of 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace of peace. also here 86% of ads came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said they were physically misdiagnosed, 55% of women spoke of psychic mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguan women's minister in Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "on every woman who has been refunded in Paraguay because of psychic mistrust ad, 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman who would be refunded because of physical mistrust ad, two women who do not do this," "" "stated it at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's icide in Paraguay is no own criminal offence, the prosecutor's authorities can not be documented adequately how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman is due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible Misshandals and a legal system that doesn't work</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want that, but then there was still. this was supposed to regret it forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos together. but for two years she bore mental violence on one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time recognising the most severely recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once be victims of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I have read earlier this, I always thought that this is just women who are too embarrassed, because they can deceive themselves of violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never ever happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the misery by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name to name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during their two year relationship and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetoric whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour has also been a form of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and did not leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of Misshandals would at least have had some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner took her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo called CREO ("I think") that consists of women who are all in some way victims of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">You do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner she finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it was mainly concerned about money, power and influence of their former Partners.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, faulty implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but not apply.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill is discussed in the paraguayischen parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Pordenllas (# Printer).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# Non-Weniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter which is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law considers to explain Femizide to an independent crime continuance and punish harder to punish as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legislative text was changed in some points to also win the Members for the Law, the feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions are piled, which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill is intended to cost the bulk of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which need to bear the victims of violence currently, if they just want to reimburse it and want a safe accommodation to abandon the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">"" "" "" "Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislator does not provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, Misshland is seen as a part of interpersonal relations.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the paraguayischen senat. previously, parts of the law had been altered. however, among other things, a passage was cancelled, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure is done with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in Africa. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for seduced medical research there are two reasons: for an absence of global health care, many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined in the poorest countries of Africa far more serious effects than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, in building their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the centrallabors in the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially at Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself was on HIV virus, before he decided to go home to support the sampled health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warriors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media over these research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrior talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results. thereby, I support the samic national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I also have a research program for developing molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what are your opinion of the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions to have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions that we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the funding and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it adequate?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the US and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries. it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there are interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion the potential for scientific research in Africa, where should it concentrate, and how can we support the development process?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There are need for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer sciences, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit very much.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa to Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed, things to do and the complicated access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that journals can only be accessed by payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how to change "Open Source" seed producers the global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton rushed to the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For nearly 20 years, Morton's work was only set by its own imagination and the question as many salutations he can get limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he was therefore not able to use it further.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotation or green leaf.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more such patents have been registered to more plants such as grain or carton varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts will ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still grow a salad, but it now needs longer because his work is still growing steadily with more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like being in a river a rock that I have to pump." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we need to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go to salads too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stick to the court, no one can breed any more of a new salatvariety because all the features are already patented. "he makes so good as possible and try to grow the ones he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful however and tries to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts from the International Space station ISS have bred red RÃ¶mersalat of the variety outreddish in the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there will be tested if plants are grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"" "the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" "" "Open Source" "" ") is inspired by the movement for free" "" "Open Source" "" "software to provide alternatives to copyrighted software." ""</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to make sure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property and thus are usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called by Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can use the seeds free of them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed well and sell it. "open source" breeders will only allow others to breed their seed to breed so their own varieties and it will not be immediate - two aspects which are prohibited by many plant paternity or prescribed.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeriated Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board member Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds also plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter, or only little by taking seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stressed that the "Open-Source" movement does not work with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, cores, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "those who want to buy good, locally and sustainable vegetables that are offered in August and September 2016." those who are offered good, locally and sustainably producing vegetables, should also know that the way that vegetables are cultivated, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritionist without seed sound is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit to others to keep their seed well-free. thus, in contrast, its action is to be patented, seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, since the available Genopool due to the ever more numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is thus more always available, unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive Director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with a genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property, making it available for plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts such as Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat has been patented in an even bigger style as a salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are so bred that they have targeted their desired characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves as far as to those due to which they thrive into certain environments and threats like pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents. genetic variety is currently necessary than ever since the changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman recognises Carly Scaduto that genetic variety are generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four European banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company is set up for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the intellectual property of other breeders" "" "da" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties to promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is up." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Such protection does not impedes innovations, but also promotes innovation by providing more material and know-how to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait for a patent expiring, certainly no innovations.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait for such a long time to breed plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle already.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources always have been a general good and must continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and moneateries are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible if we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton interferes in the concept of itself, plant characteristics: "we did not really create the characteristics ourselves.</seg>

<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who breed a kind, grow also his own values in it.</seg>

<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents, it create the most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>

<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be leaders in the "Open Source" breeding, but the concept is spreading quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, is working together as a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional commercial plants, the center with farmers is working together and helps them to breed new varieties that fulfill certain demands.</seg>

<seg id="2687">(regulations for the breeder differ from country to country, because the Ossi obligation cannot simply be part of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it is directed against the current practice of the European patent application, the patents on conventional plants allowed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to put the Patent Office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and seed companies from all over Eastern Africa to learn something about the "Open Source" seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">Still the Egyptian authorities still unlock the content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of May 5, the Egyptian government has documented the website of the WNetwork for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported about selectively.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it sharply criticized the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The WNetwork for Human Rights Information abrupt, in spite of this attack and the mock of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities, which must adhere to its objective to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it was never so difficult to pursue these goals, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI has never been so difficult to overcome the block and not give up. we insist on to continue our task.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 web pages, such as bdonor the independent news page MADA Masr, Arabic-speaking issue of Huffington Post and that from Qatar-speaking network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of webpages to the victim please. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides the ANHRI's blog contains also on the blog of the Colombian and human rights research, Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he does not write in Egypt's web pages and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to deal with the censors of the Egyptian government, even the aim of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Ziadas blog is native, on the other hand, is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent almost 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards during December 2013, while he recorded the student's student and recorded a video as the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolves around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the blocking of the government and reflected, what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, to unlock blogs is very old, however, has a priority in the era of Abdelfatalities al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been able to convey to me the feeling of a siege of siege; An arrest, a attempted murder, pre-charge of the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I do not wrote in vain. in other words, my words have an effect, if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I took it to the post of articles to deal with the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mugs go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this erges technical tests on the networks of various internet service providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE documented the blockage of vendors, possible by orbiting internettle and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noted, as the blocking of web pages that VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally wasted that the censors are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis, with which it can proceed before the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will they attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The population will dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day for day we report newspapers in whole Brazil with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard theme.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2758">Reports like these are daily daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local paper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For detailed reporting of violence in Rio-known newspaper "Extra" on 16 August the editorial "This is not normal," in which she announced a new section called "War in Rio".</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the paper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world such as murder, robbery, sex-proliferation, etc. all that happens from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio, is in the heading "War in Rio" (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, the editor in the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure.</seg>
<seg id="2765">"" "" "" "extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war jerk in a country that does not recognise war at all." ""</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that, according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, 843 states, which are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we realize that a war is discourse, if it is distorted, it can also be used, atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then ask questions to cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" be used more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira against it, to call the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to account for accountability in the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and bad planning - as an extra in the analysis of military deployment in Rio itself has demonstrated - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockages, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories, a joint initiative of the peace organisation Pax and the Forschungsinstitut The Syria Institute, are located in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib currently around a million Syrians in a state of siege.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition assume it on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these have stood by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus under siege, which resulted to rely on local residents or rely on tunnels and checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through longlasting blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">In return, a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and perform the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the conventional, in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their dietary fiadfastness makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The directing of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we opted for cultivation of fungi, because they have high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel scarcity, locally produced fuel will be used to provide the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices, that they began with" "" "production from the regions" "", "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2821">"" "now they are designed to have a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed to mushrooms anywhere in the East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people were protested on October 21st in many district capitcapitols in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires that were graded in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Two forty-two people died and approximately 70 were violated as a result of the Waldbraries of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government had proclaimed a state of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the region of Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 dead persons.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fireoutbreaks that spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande is a similar tragedy, where it was through the fires of 64 deaths and over 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest-areas by satellite-recordings, are burned alone in Portugal about 500,000 hectares of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>

<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus was pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of slightly flammable wood, like in a vicious circle, according to fires of this kind always spread further.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These issues have added that the website of civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as inhabitants sought or tried to contact, affiliated to offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that catered the population with information: they used the own civil protection data with the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer of JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of firemen and was postponed to this fateful weekend in October so that the servers followed the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires: there was more than half a million access strikes.</seg>

<seg id="2873">During one night in the fall of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2874">Two years ago, a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mujahedin groupings that had conquered the short-lived pro-Soviet government, so Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair.</seg>
<seg id="2875">At this time Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in Central Afghan istan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother said it back then, she knew she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy should break.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the locks.</seg>

<seg id="2883">CC-2.0</seg>
<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of Hazara's dominating party Eb-e-Wahsoldier was just murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt protectionable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban in their hatred on the Hazara well-known Taliban were getting closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked for a few years in a coherence. the work was hard and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little salary, and went into Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed bags with mortar that were heavier than he himself to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, the life of Afghan refugees was shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "remembered Ashark in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the jobsite, on which we worked on." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating whatsoever. we found nylon slats in front of the open windows so that we are not erfry at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and strangled on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application, Ashark 2002 came to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time it was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church which divided twice a day with the need for needy.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for expired asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that advance asylum seekers in the country are desastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation for Europe for Europe writes, the system is suffering from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special recording centers." "" "this is improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unbiased personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center, if they officially launched a request for asylum - what may be drawn after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who don't have money for an accommodation, either rely on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So erging it also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unselfish lifestyle helped Asharaf to liberate itself from these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After spending several years different work in construction, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while still a second hostel and a schnellimp opened.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the theme of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") of director, Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award, which was already awarded the 24th of 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans company, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afghan.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Asharafs goals are far enough beyond Italian Gastronomy and retail, and aim back to the country that he had to leave out as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where a risk is, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I never forget my country and I can't live happy if I know that my people suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">They represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else. "</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forks plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservative techniques. "in this way they can sell their crop excess on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts, but in the end are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey itself. now he would like to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment, or the indignation of a criminal payment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was advertised by sixty parliamentarians, is currently the legislative and constitutional Committee of the Parliament and should be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">May, another deputy proposed a legislative proposal, in which hardened penalties would be introduced for the insult of the President or a high officials.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law the avoidance of the president as well as government institutions is already punishable. however, under the law proposition, such a act would act with prison and money loans, right-wing experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the fall of the Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo Zid (known as Shawkan), which was arrested on 13 August 2013, as he demonstrated violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup against the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protesters were arrested, who were arrested in the same incident, four years in jail at a distance date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his proceedings were postponed to the 20th May because the prison Direction according to human rights groups was assigned to the accused of bringing the defendants from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan threatens the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, hypocrisy of e.g. arms, illegal assembly, murder and seeking murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal said in Giza the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of pro-Morsi seat block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
