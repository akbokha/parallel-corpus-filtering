this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before the someone had heard of Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he released spectacular that the NSA listened to illegal tele@@ phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally cor@@ rupted Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if it sounds crazy , read it .
it is an unbelievable story .
but do you know who the chapter is not at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 10 years the government has been determined against R@@ isen and called on him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists .
according to the first constitutional order , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ gs they provide .
thus , when the government was standing at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said he would prefer to go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the process , it happened somewhat unusual .
suddenly , although they have been advised for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped on margins .
the reason : in time electronic monitoring , re@@ porter and springs can always be hidden less .
instead of failing and bring rates to the statements , that could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators have become secret without his consent , his phone call secret ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel references with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and cr@@ ens .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect his wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all the US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government has led too much from their work as secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore rely on the freedom of the press , which should be protected by the first constitutional order because the government has more and more possibilities , all utter@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology of the government allows to byp@@ ass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , instead of in retro@@ fitting , in witness .
today , there is communication software that has not yet been written as an iron book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source over@@ flow system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , which has been developed by us Swar@@ tz , and today is of the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news page , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer collect information secre@@ tly , and many of the information they would require , would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world develop new sp@@ y technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
it is time to make sure that not only technology as Edward Snowden have a chance to convey mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers .
who wants to tell about Miss@@ y about the care of soldiers who want to report and over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t defeats . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider , which warned us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the biggest data collection of history has been revealed . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that friction and mighty &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness to a statement . &#93; this week we were given by messages about a bac@@ on of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ vens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has gone back .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ vens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend from nursery , a famous cell@@ ists .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to wait for the next publication and on the next release documents .
now it sounds like the P@@ lot of a agency &apos;s subscription or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it seems cri@@ es from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we handle it ?
but the truth is , if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ vens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and this affects us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomenal .
in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ vens will be used by a few of them to hide their assets and de@@ cks -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people this whole world seems very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ vens function .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is the matter .
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
presumably because there have so far no prominent Americans killed in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ vens .
but through the principle , after which these tax ha@@ vens function , Mos@@ que Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
would we have a dat@@ le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a libr@@ arian ID .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed staff from school , school@@ children to pick off .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to cut especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all concerned us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a short @-@ c@@ apped investig@@ ator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator existed as an African Minister , the suspected money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that all of us were suggestions on an attorney &apos;s lawyer , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ per@@ for@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course anybody was handed over to anyone else . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single attorney that has been provided by our covered investigation .
it is not about a single leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very dec@@ ep@@ tive , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing could ever be changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful .
but as a borrowed optim@@ ist , I see that a lot has begun to change .
in the last few years we have seen for@@ ests to more transparency what the owners of firms are concerned .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
since then , the EU captured in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US has lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ vens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ bands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy to get up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end with laws this kind of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da would have landed .
one day after I had completed my design study , I made a rear @-@ farm sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made straight a road trip around the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place ?
but I just got to know him about it ! he says he would go to the peace@@ keepers , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning this . I don &apos;t want to cut off in the trunk of a Maz@@ land !
this is a small box !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I listened to saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a bubble bath . you can sleep in my living room &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was in bed , I star@@ red to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what I got broken down to myself ?
a wild break@@ er sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on toe tips to the door , and my sleeping door shut down .
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
the artwork , which he had bought from me today is hanging in his classroom . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as a stranger , actually friends who waited only to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattresses , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I am job@@ less , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I believe , creativity can create it , fear in fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I over@@ lays how we could earn something about it . our apartment will stay with us for a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us overnight , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so called &quot; air conditioning and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors with us for 20 dollars .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we talked to our last guest and fell at the door to the castle , by Brian , and I join us .
had we just discovered that we can find new friends at the same time , and we were able to pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
in this way , we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room where you visit .
over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
but indeed they do not .
nobody , who is still completely at con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because we all learnt as children that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you look at the things you can do . we were able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and hap@@ tics -- it is the total experience .
we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create the immense confidence between people who never met before .
can design so do something ?
is it possible to create trust with design confidence ?
I want to give you a treasure , which degree of confidence we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ folded mobile phone your left seat .
this quietly approach of panic , which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts you feel when they open the door the first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the distor@@ ting mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most are feeling the responsibility .
so also the most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
only time so , who has now actually Al Gor@@ es mobile ?
could you proc@@ laim on Twitter that he dict@@ ates the President of the President ?
you can now return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour would be presented only once with his name ; if he said , Wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine , you would have 150 respon@@ dents , who all say : &quot; he can really keep very well distor@@ ted cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you &apos;d have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for the people to prevent negative evaluations .
finally we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their arrangements before we put it online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford , as probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and residence .
little unexpected we trust the people most , who are most resem@@ ble us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social incident .
it is exciting when you add the call to one person -- in our case through statements .
if one has less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but one has more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation is common to similarities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preference .
furthermore , we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there .
here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
if you have too little nar@@ rated , such as &quot; hi ! , &quot; you do not get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if one tells us a lot , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aun@@ ching art@@ works in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create design with design , produce this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
with what we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first , incredibly good luck .
second : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need which was not covered before .
for us the business runs very well .
of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties celebrated or devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts me if I just think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the An@@ ru@@ fer , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , the 123 million displaced nights had only a fraction of a problem .
because people trust each other too right .
when confidence works , there can be mir@@ ac@@ ulous arise .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even gave blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who are inc@@ lined to go to heart attack due to permanent activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel to save life , even though they are not yet familiar with it .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while one gets a b@@ yp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you feel lonely , they bring books over .
they can even stay longer than to calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay is running .
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money @-@ trans@@ actions ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is now just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hiring industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade in which human relationships promises .
people place a part of himself open , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , this is compatible with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but it is less authentic .
but what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
what if on every place you visited , a group there would wait to be a thoroughly re@@ plen@@ um and show one at a Kne@@ ip@@ ent@@ our district , one of which you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would like to share apartments from reason to sharing ?
how would that look like ?
what if cities would like to take the idea of a common part ?
I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government ,
the residents have now been offered . students who were in search of a qu@@ ay ,
were given to people whose children were deduc@@ ted . they were launched in incub@@ ator programs ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , at night , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems to be as crazy as it was attached to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality also gave it before .
there have been similar websites in front of us .
so why has our work worked ?
apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome profound prejudices .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to reflect every time a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a Belie@@ ver ? a experts ?
maybe even a sister .
or suppres@@ sed , a bra@@ in@@ doctr@@ ination , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay on security at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know any Muslims .
presumably the people do not talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met any Muslims , it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee @-@ owner -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ gladly @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ting myself .
no , not as homo@@ sexual man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why are you oppressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the L@@ ily was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in relation to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I felt a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
I read him , thought to , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow devotion which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm will sometimes bring me to the wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone percei@@ ves you , you fully understands , and yet somehow loves you ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had turned into the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ ina . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ ged from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly into indign@@ ation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; best line@@ age ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ra@@ ging Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
not only my country had been attacked but in the N@@ u , the acts of others turned me into an susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start building studies .
I remember how I drove me -- when we drove silent -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslims .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then heard , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , the said , &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; B@@ lei@@ ades in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ed you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who had kept for Muslims , and hit the outdoors .
there really were fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because people who had attacked this country , have attacked our country .
I have taken the anger of men to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish and close stri@@ ps .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only poses the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one keeps only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tum@@ our in the body of the USA , but an essential organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , agents and Olymp@@ ion@@ ics .
will make the closing of mos@@ ques America more secure ?
it may stop a few parking spaces but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant and to show greater citizens &apos; participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
while radi@@ ating process has determined that it begins online . as a result , the person can cut a brain @-@ la@@ undering , even by their family , so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ ut their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or from faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes their brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to your imagination , if you recognize them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u club cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups maintain their ideology reasons in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at it , she does not drive them what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Bible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality to read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she would like to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of un@@ righteousness in the world , she would only bring them into difficulties .
of nothing inspired and something that had given sense to her anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts , who said to be a solution .
this Ima@@ m presented the connection to God and her church .
instead of accused them for their anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she kept her to join the IS .
this was an insight , as the Islam@@ ophobia me and my family concerns .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things .
we accept more of an author@@ itarian governance system , conformity and prejudices .
one study shows : if you have reported test people , in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they agreed to military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcis@@ ion of rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an ak@@ ade@@ pt problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims go up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the ap@@ ron of Iraq war and during two election periods .
so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to exploit the foundation of a free society , the sensible and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
we may sense it as the first but the toxic air of fear sh@@ out to all of us .
in assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ist , it is not just about to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was on the dental Fac@@ ulty , cem@@ ented , much promising ...
his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was aston@@ ished and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is from my bro@@ therhood has become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne during her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as in a execution , after leaving statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he took eight times to de@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
we said it and for us it was not an easy decision , for it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one where we can exercise our religion free of charge .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the nursery we drove silent , with high pressure on the mosque .
I took him out , drew my shoes off , went into the prayers , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thanks and was welcomed by our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who were come to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment , I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ced prejudices .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safely ?
or will you connect to those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a Ner@@ v .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , work a thin@@ ker with low @-@ depth , therefore an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , decei@@ ve you . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it allows .
when we look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study to Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things .
they want to prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way I am an exception .
if people seem like an exception to the rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for craf@@ ting , is about to become a billion business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . it is made possible in research organisations worldwide .
before air parcel to our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
through inter@@ locking devices , high speed and acceleration in narro@@ west space .
you can also build self @-@ confident structures .
you have learned to wear bur@@ dens to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must be collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tas@@ ks .
for the modern demos , we use a new location technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a spin@@ ach of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest image e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a plane , that is trying to beat two flies with a cap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gler is it in advance @-@ flight efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most Star@@ r@@ flü@@ g@@ ern it can float , and thus has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a dish@@ on@@ side .
a restriction of le@@ aks is that they react more sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind @-@ bo@@ es .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the air conditioner does not matter what position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number of daily parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts , which join forces to hurt you .
decades ago skilled pilots have been able to fly remot@@ ely controlled air@@ crafts , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a H@@ eck@@ ru@@ y .
recently we discovered that flies with only one works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical simple tel@@ ev@@ ed flight unit . it was invented recently .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no dam@@ pers , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ des , no further actu@@ ator or controversy , just a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical , it happens very much in the interior life , so that it can fly stable and can move around in space .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ gate . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the likelihood it is right to throw it , if everyone can see , is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the Om@@ nic@@ op@@ ter with its eight pro@@ pane , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation .
by this he receives the au@@ ral ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is shot or even how it ro@@ ses .
naturally , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ pane .
some is adjustable in models , the rest is learned directly at the fly flying .
see you that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is spinning in clo@@ ck@@ wise .
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine if also limited .
we will now demonstrate that we are making a half air@@ planes .
the last demonstration studied synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we participated untreated micro @-@ squares -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technologies and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine out there , would like to become a flying lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage lies in the development and the creative act .
it serves as memory , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowing them to form in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago in a very distant galaxy two black holes ever faster , they turned out the mass of thre@@ es in a tenth of a se@@ ater in pure energy .
for this short moment they lit brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole unknown universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy put them in the form of light --
we are talking about black holes .
the whole energy became the space @-@ time tissue itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
1,3 billion years ago was created just id@@ able life on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ ces , humans and -- God always stand for us - even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- R@@ ai Weis@@ s from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ Tech -- to build a huge laser detec@@ tor to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are about by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most of them stopped them for crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy gen@@ ies , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detec@@ tor LIG@@ O : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ome@@ ter@@ - Gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observatory .
during the follow @-@ up time the precision of LIG@@ O could substantially increase what the recognition capacity has improved tremend@@ ously .
therefore they are now called Advanced LIG@@ O .
in early September 2015 LIG@@ O was started for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detec@@ tor , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ous black holes had through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detec@@ tor .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the par@@ ting from my To@@ d@@ ros@@ ken father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all this , for what I worked is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist , with black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a gra@@ dient in the space of space and time .
by passing the wave , the space and its entire content in one direction are stretched and into the other mel@@ ight .
for re@@ viewing lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a correct al@@ ber@@ ated dance .
&quot; stretching and st@@ ing@@ es , stretch and barrier . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched during the advent of waves and mel@@ ted . the stretching of an average human race was 10 high @-@ 21 .
that is , 20 zer@@ len after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st performer , one explained the LIG@@ O employees for crazy .
with a five kilometers long laser detec@@ tor , and that is already absurd , this length should be exactly measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . that &apos;s grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ Os , hunting for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties when building such detec@@ tors are violent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are dark , and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains , LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : facial extracts , the size of your mobile phones .
that is quite convenient . because you can make a picture or a map of things , you can perceive the light of several points ahead of you .
in pots it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that offer you particularly much :
the face of your child approximately .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as audio @-@ board and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot finish with them simple pictures of objects in the All .
but by taking care of changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble area .
so when we convert wav@@ pattern in she@@ ars , we can hear all that literally .
the gravity of gravity can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , so that my colleague Scott has very long busy themselves .
S@@ H : two black , non @-@ going holes , one @-@ pen simply : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very fast , you listen to the same circle with an additional tone change . that sounds like this : Wu @-@ Level @-@ wu @-@ Level @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIG@@ O : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; Yemen , who knows what he has to hear , recognises this as the sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold sun @-@ mass that turn around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the thicker body in all , one with a mass of 29 probe , the other with a mass of 36 probe , revol@@ ve each hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent importance of LIG@@ O .
lightweight a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this road we can hear all loud and the invisible .
much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not visible .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ ser@@ ge@@ che stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about all of them .
however , the exciting physical processes happen however in the nucleus that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through , as these op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would be more transparent glass . however , I would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the jungle is covered by its own neighbor .
using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and that is most important : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before and of which we don &apos;t have any idea of . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , LIG@@ O was equal in the first attempt that we didn &apos;t expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , the black holes bring forth , such as LIG@@ O them , are the Din@@ osau@@ rs of the Universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . black holes are so to speak to Sau@@ ri@@ er@@ bones for our archaeological work .
LIG@@ O offers us a completely different perspective on the events occurring in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great detec@@ tors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in all .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
would I start playing with the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly to do that I was afraid , eliminating my fear .
my fear , speeches to keep , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away .
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life on an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it began with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; estimate , &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I need milk for my beak @-@ up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new way of life in my family . from there I sw@@ am with them always to play with them as soon as you ask myself . no matter what I just do , or wherever I go , I say always yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I am showing me very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things that you desire for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I Cre@@ ire TV . I have more productive TV .
I am doing television , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist .
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days sometimes four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three entries , which are simultaneously in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how to Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running each other on Thursday evening .
around the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced , so still ob@@ end@@ ous . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans of the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire that burn around the world .
do you know who that still makes ?
nobody , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , a business or a classroom to take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not only around the computer , and imagin@@ ative , and it is true if I say , I understand that it does not dream with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spiration -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened to work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is when I set troops up when I painted on a canvas .
so as a result , you have a high tone , lying a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and rational , and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me if the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go forever on her .
many people take if I declare to them the bu@@ zz that I &apos;m talking to writing that writing to me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , that does it .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started working with TV production as I began to work and work , build and working together , I discovered this thing , this tot@@ als , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the money is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the money is a drug .
the money is music . the money is light and air .
the money is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you cannot asp@@ ire to be different than size .
the feeling , not to be different than asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is the ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know that I did not go for failure , and I know only that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it in question .
in order to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more hiber@@ nate , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more things you observe , the more I &apos;m writing history , all the more expectations there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , not true ?
the land , which I have created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the money . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then it stops the bu@@ zz .
revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , hidden .
the bu@@ zz hal@@ ted .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single work@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz heard .
the bu@@ zz of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
I did not love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the money did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hour days , worked out weekends , no rep@@ ent@@ ance , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps not , does not exist , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what makes you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you work , you love what you do , you love to be a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the bu@@ zz feels , if you didn &apos;t know the bu@@ zz , if you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; Ask a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way to the outside , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things are aware of :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
it does not call anyone more &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
when is that happening ?
I forgot it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz is sad , and here everything is changing in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and play their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing exceptional .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of Sum@@ mens , I can do nothing except to adjust .
I am focused .
I am silent .
the land that I have created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ iter @-@ p@@ ens and the song in which it &apos;s going to let go , or whatever the girl leaves in &quot; The king@@ fis@@ h@@ in . &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me is rede@@ emed .
a mental door goes into and a energy ub comes in .
and that is not immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz comes slowly back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is soft , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay with the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the titan@@ ium environment , this is only the replacement .
when I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe me with broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the money is not a force and it is not a job @-@ specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sums of money depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the river which comes from life spirit .
the real sums of money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sums ignor@@ es the pressure of history , that enligh@@ tening tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real sums is simple and original .
the real sums of God is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but maybe I whis@@ pered God the wrong words , for what God said to me that I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , a lot more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I am doing this as a solid rule , so that I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any guilt .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice but if I want to hear the sums again .
I wish it would be so simple . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not about to work ans@@ at@@ zwe@@ ise as you work .
the truth is hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work as well as at home .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person is working better than to be at home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed , none of them .
we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we Dis@@ plat@@ zen Sei@@ fen@@ infl@@ en .
I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I am always after my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children tell me how to live , and the sums of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever ceased with playing ?
you can also say it ! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you can hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a dre@@ amer .
you are right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ p@@ pet show figure .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they mon@@ ds that they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Marien@@ bad or Ke@@ ks replaces me .
and speak my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more requires not .
everyone can get 15 minutes a bit , even at a bad @-@ like day !
15 minutes on the piece !
no mobile , no laundry , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the children beg@@ ged .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is considered to feel the bu@@ zz to have a place for his soul &apos;s peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
to play &quot; Play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and preserve it yourself .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I victories . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not get full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I am not working .
working not without play .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear a UFO melody , she meets me and my soul . she for@@ warding me to new ideas . I re@@ direc@@ ts it to his way . I use it in full and love my work again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it .
I do not need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap blis@@ ters and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the bu@@ zz of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful .
it is me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to work and play more games .
and nevertheless I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fire are still burning .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the money . the land that I am scar@@ ed to the marathon which I run@@ e , the forces , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sums : the sums of life .
the more I feel this money the more makes this unusual , cont@@ ested , naked , and new feeling of feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things out , I get you to life .
this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after a severe violation of the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I was working in neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures .
sure they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; deep @-@ ir@@ rational stimulation . &quot; in doing so , you im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to affect the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that the neurological function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , suffering from heavy tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not imply Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was Chief of ophthalm@@ ologist and working day and night in the emergency .
often I received patients with sk@@ ull @-@ stags trau@@ ma .
you need to imagine that in sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain rolls and the sk@@ ull pressure is inc@@ lined .
to save life , you have to reduce the sk@@ ull pressure .
to do this , you sometimes have to remove a portion of the clouds of brain .
instead of throwing the pe@@ aked brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a rif@@ le , is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to flo@@ urish them .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts there were Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
maybe you are still aware of the bi@@ ology lesson that stem cells un@@ ripe cells , which can transform itself into any cell type of organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells have kept different .
they were slowly and after a few weeks they died .
so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells , but did differently .
we needed long to understand where they came .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our big @-@ stag cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the removal of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing some potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to look like a piece of brain mass from the non@@ lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and they then select coloured , in order to be able to pursue them in the brain .
in the last step we im@@ planted it at the near of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Auto@@ otran@@ op@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ mi@@ tig@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells into brain brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we re@@ im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that after a few weeks they disappeared as if they were taken again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not be used , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we had an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to observe below the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the evidence that they show are these small points . these are the cells , which we inherited in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take food pel@@ lets from a tray .
they made them very good .
as they achieved a stable skill level , we last in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex the manual level .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they could no longer move her hand anymore .
just as it would happen with people , they recovered spontane@@ ously to a certain degree , just like a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural brain mechanisms . they recover to some degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the ape , which recovered spontane@@ ously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original power from before injury .
it is not so accurate and not so fast .
now you see when we re@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the irritation .
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time we found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use .
we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still being im@@ planted with human beings .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I will definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : take a look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trial . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it needs a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi@@ centric study .
you really need to point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit at TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as a inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changing spirits .
we believe capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections - not to influence austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
at this moment , I thought it might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my officers who repeatedly said that democracy would be abol@@ ished , if they would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you to believe in cooperation with me , to believe Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ sting and defen@@ cel@@ esti@@ al democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are wor@@ shipped , our future is dark and our great , new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out you to an interesting contradiction , which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin summit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain mountain , who throws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the debt mountain ,
but few recognize its scep@@ tics .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , however , are too anxious to invest it there where it could be productive and income that you could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , a 3,4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar have been invested in the US , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , streets , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds much money until one compar@@ es it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do , except the stock b@@ lower and the real estate prices .
so debt and un@@ productive capital make up the twin summit , which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , which could not invest in an end @-@ loop the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who could not invest in . exactly as O@@ di@@ pus Father , who might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow .
un@@ wanted the circumstances leads , which lead to that O@@ di@@ pus k@@ ills him .
this is my ha@@ des with capitalism --
his exce@@ ed@@ ly art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy a solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we understand by democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ eles defined democracy as the social form , in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed off naturally too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be an error to min@@ t the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these conclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision on the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they gave the working poor , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gives them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal vo@@ icing in questions of the state of state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long been held --
like a candle , that lights very bright , it is also quickly spread .
however , today our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta who ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy came up only when a full separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process was established upon policy , while the economy is -- the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our democracies today , the separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , while the economy is gradually under@@ mined the policy and depri@@ ved them .
do you wonder why politicians do not have so much earlier ?
it is not due to a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you can still be in the government today and still don &apos;t believe in power because the power of politics is dra@@ fted into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ des with capitalism .
if you think it &apos;s about just like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , which thus sustain@@ s the animals , of which they no@@ urished , dec@@ im@@ ated that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy , which the policy has so far known that it grows through the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are increasing , inequality is rising , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are to be scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful of capitalism dis@@ drives the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and the welfare of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control , just as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn &apos;t sound good .
the doctrine of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is a solution : the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ glo@@ omy driven by automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation will be higher , the waste of waste , and social conflicts deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China will come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we need to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in doing so we respect the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ic monitoring of hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements that he has produced , will survive --
the most interesting question is whether capitalism is defined by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or by something that the society serve in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; in which machines serve people and people to invest their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I believe we may be optimistic .
so what does it mean , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples .
in the field of companies , please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is working just -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
then , all incomes come from capital and from rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees working there , which the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and austerity , and ultimately no up@@ lifting point summit .
in the field of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; keep in mind that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government is paying the sum that matches the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund has been invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investments are scar@@ ce .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference proposed in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time not the technical means had to be implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian , global ke@@ yn@@ es@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography themselves as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not , technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are at ease .
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ ing , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you have said very clearly what you can hold from the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies , we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited the democracy to politics while the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ ative that China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect to liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development concerned .
what one can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China now propos@@ ing what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of violent after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ en@@ ers are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone .
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
namely , to say goodbye to the com@@ plac@@ ency and the constant denial is that a massive slow@@ ing line went through the eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity to be based on the Greek proposal -- the way the first proposal was , who revealed this denial to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to be the denial .
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism into life , it will perhaps delay a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we don &apos;t change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
naturally I have made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to conce@@ de that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; neither from the Troika of creditors which has imposed on us this policy , and one : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite of aggressive ties of the conversations , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they did not survive , the un@@ justified flow of forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not only have disastrous consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be also detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for staying at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although it is likely to be held responsible for 22 @-@ mid minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is leading cler@@ k at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Films , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
of course this is a very hard converted industry .
there are so many TV @-@ series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are at the right side of this bend .
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , after having watched a season , your brain asks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not forget to get on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to refrain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average payout , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and put them online , where they can view everyone free of charge .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , do you understand , right ?
millions of spectators are looking at these episodes .
however , they don &apos;t know they will be observed when watching this shows .
you are watching by Roy and his team who will accommodate everything .
you comprehend when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or re@@ viewing it .
they collect millions of data to determine with these data then what show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and it yields the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this bend 7.@@ 4 is and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of holding a contest , he and his team have looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , which shows they like etc .
then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this bend . so exactly where to go .
of course , is the question : what happened here ?
you have two very funny , data rever@@ sible companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is that ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
we are optimized for very powerful computers .
the Mind@@ est thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
if data analysis does not work so this is something frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we have more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does someone here know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
nobody . OK , that is even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if any one is in the USA in prison and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not .
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results generated . this is not because a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even if the data is irrever@@ sible companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 , Google announced that it is predicted by data analysis export of flu , the bad way , predic@@ ting -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success was made in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year around year , until there was suddenly no longer working ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it simply wasn &apos;t working , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data rever@@ sible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand .
despite all these mistakes the data obtained in decisions of life - at the workplace , in case of regulation , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imaginable many data to make serious decisions as to make the decision for cancer therapy
or developing a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do mostly do two things :
as a result , you put this problem into its parts , so you can analyse the items ; as a while you put the items back together to put a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to comp@@ ose the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is un@@ complete , to take a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain &apos;s brain .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they would otherwise not have been able to use them . but the decision on how to put all these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first of them as they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they chose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong if data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will leave it later with a technology .
so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it through something much higher , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so perhaps the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still paying off , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks .
in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thanks beautiful .
