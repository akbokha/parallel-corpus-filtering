<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before the someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he released spectacular that the NSA listened to illegal telephones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA had literally corrupted Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If it sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an unbelievable story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter is not at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "almost 10 years the government has been determined against Risen and called on him to call his alleged sources." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">In this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional order, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mugs they provide.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thus, when the government was standing at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said he would prefer to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, it happened somewhat unusual.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they have been advised for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped on margins.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in time electronic monitoring, reporter and springs can always be hidden less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing and bring rates to the statements, that could also do its digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators have become secret without his consent, his phone call secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel references with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblowers and crens.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect his whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all the US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government has led too much from their work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore rely on the freedom of the press, which should be protected by the first constitutional order because the government has more and more possibilities, all uttering." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, instead of in retrofitting, in witness.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today, there is communication software that has not yet been written as an iron book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source overflow system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, which has been developed by us Swartz, and today is of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news page, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer collect information secretly, and many of the information they would require, would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world develop new spy technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is time to make sure that not only technology as Edward Snowden have a chance to convey misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to tell about Missy about the care of soldiers who want to report and overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint defeats. or a Wallstreet insider, which warned us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the biggest data collection of history has been revealed.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that friction and mighty] [we bate Robert Palmer from Global Witness to a statement.] this week we were given by messages about a bacon of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosque Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers are going to companies such as Mosque Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has gone back.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stamp-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend from nursery, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous to wait for the next publication and on the next release documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the Plot of a agency's subscription or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle it?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens will be used by a few of them to hide their assets and decks -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to truly understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what is the matter.</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there have so far no prominent Americans killed in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But through the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mosque Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">Would we have a datleck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to provide less information to start a company than to get a librarian ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed staff from school, schoolchildren to pick off.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to cut especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerned us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a short-capped investigator at the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator existed as an African Minister, the suspected money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that all of us were suggestions on an attorney's lawyer, how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all preperforations. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course anybody was handed over to anyone else. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single attorney that has been provided by our covered investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leaders, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we need to change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very deceptive, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing could ever be changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist, I see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen forests to more transparency what the owners of firms are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US has lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have brought a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind headbands.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in the economy to get up and say," "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use them to end with laws this kind of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency which is now possible to end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda would have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I had completed my design study, I made a rear-farm sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda remained standing and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made straight a road trip around the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I do not know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him about it! he says he would go to the peacekeepers, but I don't know if he really is planning this. I don't want to cut off in the trunk of a Mazland!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small box!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I listened to saying," "" "I have a bubble bath. you can sleep in my living room" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "h, how please?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was in bed, I starred to the ceiling and thought: "Oh Mann! what I got broken down to myself?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild breaker sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on toe tips to the door, and my sleeping door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me today is hanging in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as a stranger, actually friends who waited only to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To accommodate people on my air mattresses, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am jobless, almost pleite, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I believe, creativity can create it, fear in fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I overlays how we could earn something about it. our apartment will stay with us for a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us overnight, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so called "air conditioning and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors with us for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-Omeletts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we talked to our last guest and fell at the door to the castle, by Brian, and I join us.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we can find new friends at the same time, and we were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">In this way, we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people post public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room where you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still completely at consolation, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all learnt as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you look at the things you can do. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and haptics -- it is the total experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create the immense confidence between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design so do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a treasure, which degree of confidence we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unfolded mobile phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly approach of panic, which you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts you feel when they open the door the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the distorting mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are feeling the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So also the most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only time so, who has now actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim on Twitter that he dictates the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour would be presented only once with his name; if he said, Whence he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine, you would have 150 respondents, who all say: "he can really keep very well distorted cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you'd have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system strengthens the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for the people to prevent negative evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their arrangements before we put it online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford, as probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little unexpected we trust the people most, who are most resemble us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social incident.</seg>
<seg id="181">It is exciting when you add the call to one person -- in our case through statements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But one has more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is common to similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">Furthermore, we experienced that trust is dependent on how much you get there.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you have too little narrated, such as "hi!," you do not get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "if one tells us a lot, such as:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "aunching artworks in your apartment! I make a holiday with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create design with design, produce this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First, incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties celebrated or devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts me if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the Anrufer, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million displaced nights had only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust each other too right.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, there can be miraculous arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even gave blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect house for travelers who are inclined to go to heart attack due to permanent activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel to save life, even though they are not yet familiar with it.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while one gets a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you feel lonely, they bring books over.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer than to calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money-transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it is now just" "" "hiring industry" "", "the thing is not justified." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade in which human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">People place a part of himself open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, this is compatible with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but it is less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if traveling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if on every place you visited, a group there would wait to be a thoroughly replenum and show one at a Kneipentour district, one of which you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments from reason to sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would like to take the idea of a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships instead of loneliness and depreciation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">The residents have now been offered. students who were in search of a quay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were deducted. they were launched in incubator programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, at night, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guests at a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be as crazy as it was attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also gave it before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our work worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to reflect every time a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A Believer? a experts?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, a braindoctrination, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay on security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know any Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Presumably the people do not talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met any Muslims, it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee-owner -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegladly-Fitness-fanatics in,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outing myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear the hijab, my headgear.</seg>

<seg id="327">Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumour in the body of the USA, but an essential organ.</seg>

<seg id="330">Will make the closing of mosques America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">It may stop a few parking spaces but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant and to show greater citizens' participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">While radiating process has determined that it begins online. as a result, the person can cut a brain-laundering, even by their family, so that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abut their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or from faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>

<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she would like to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that her anger, her sense of unrighteousness in the world, she would only bring them into difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had given sense to her anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalisation by extremists, who said to be a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam presented the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accused them for their anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she kept her to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight, as the Islamophobia me and my family concerns.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept more of an authoritarian governance system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">One study shows: if you have reported test people, in which negative about Muslims have been reported, they agreed to military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an akadept problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims go up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the apron of Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to exploit the foundation of a free society, the sensible and well informed citizens." ""</seg>

<seg id="368">In assignment of collectivist, it is not just about to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous person whom she knew.</seg>

<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We said it and for us it was not an easy decision, for it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us by fear, or one where we can exercise our religion free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the nursery we drove silent, with high pressure on the mosque.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for crafting, is about to become a billion business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. it is made possible in research organisations worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel to our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France live a six meter high tower of 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Through interlocking devices, high speed and acceleration in narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-confident structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to wear burdens to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">"" "" "" "our aim is to cross the limits of possible in the autonomous flight." ""</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system autonom works, it must be collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For the modern demos, we use a new location technology of Verity Studios, a spinach of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors in order to determine the position in the room, computations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest image e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane, that is trying to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other Starrflügler is it in advance-flight efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most Starrflügern it can float, and thus has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a dishonside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of leaks is that they react more sensitive to turbulence like wind-boes.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the air conditioner does not matter what position the optimum position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number of daily parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts, which join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago skilled pilots have been able to fly remotely controlled aircrafts, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a Heckruy.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanical simple televed flight unit. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No dampers, hinges and cross-rudes, no further actuator or controversy, just a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical, it happens very much in the interior life, so that it can fly stable and can move around in space.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailgate. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The likelihood it is right to throw it, if everyone can see, is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propane, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his orientation.</seg>
<seg id="446">By this he receives the aural ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is shot or even how it roses.</seg>
<seg id="448">Naturally, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propane.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some is adjustable in models, the rest is learned directly at the fly flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">See you that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is spinning in clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine if also limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we are making a half airplanes.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated untreated micro-squares -- every single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technologies and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine out there, would like to become a flying lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage lies in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as memory, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowing them to form in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago in a very distant galaxy two black holes ever faster, they turned out the mass of threes in a tenth of a seater in pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lit brighter than all stars together in all galaxies of the whole unknown universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy put them in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We are talking about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy became the space-time tissue itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago was created just idable life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, sauces, humans and -- God always stand for us - even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from CalTech -- to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which are about by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them stopped them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy genies, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector LIGO: the Laser Interferometer- Gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the follow-up time the precision of LIGO could substantially increase what the recognition capacity has improved tremendously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore they are now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015 LIGO was started for a last test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collious black holes had through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional as this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the parting from my Todrosken father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All this, for what I worked is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist, with black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a gradient in the space of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">By passing the wave, the space and its entire content in one direction are stretched and into the other melight.</seg>
<seg id="495">For reviewing lecturers in courses for relativity-theory often a correct alberated dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and stinges, stretch and barrier."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched during the advent of waves and melted. the stretching of an average human race was 10 high-21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is, 20 zerlen after the comma, followed by a 1st performer, one explained the LIGO employees for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length should be exactly measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties when building such detectors are violent." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are dark, and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: facial extracts, the size of your mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="508">That is quite convenient. because you can make a picture or a map of things, you can perceive the light of several points ahead of you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In pots it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that offer you particularly much:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as audio-board and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now, just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot finish with them simple pictures of objects in the All.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by taking care of changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we convert wavpattern in shears, we can hear all that literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity of gravity can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, so that my colleague Scott has very long busy themselves.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-going holes, one-pen simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very fast, you listen to the same circle with an additional tone change. that sounds like this: Wu-Level-wu-Level-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement, shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard LIGO: [Surrender of the sound] Yemen, who knows what he has to hear, recognises this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold sun-mass that turn around as fast as the rods of your mixers.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the thicker body in all, one with a mass of 29 probe, the other with a mass of 36 probe, revolve each hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">Lightweight a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this road we can hear all loud and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massergeche stars in super-novae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">However, the exciting physical processes happen however in the nucleus that lies behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be more transparent glass. however, I would like to investigate the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the jungle is covered by its own neighbor.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And that is most important: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before and of which we don't have any idea of. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, LIGO was equal in the first attempt that we didn't expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, the black holes bring forth, such as LIGO them, are the Dinosaurs of the Universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. black holes are so to speak to Saurierbones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO offers us a completely different perspective on the events occurring in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in all.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>

<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "one year I would say to everything" "" "Yes!" "" "in front of which I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter whether it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Would I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly to do that I was afraid, eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear, speeches to keep, my social fear -- Puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of one word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life on an unexpectedly. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for unexplained reasons all "estimate,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if they were a waitress from the South.</seg>

<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new way of life in my family. from there I swam with them always to play with them as soon as you ask myself. no matter what I just do, or wherever I go, I say always yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I am showing me very much.</seg>

<seg id="577">"" "but it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently I understood that the" "" "Yes" "" "to play with my children my career." ""</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things that you desire for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire TV. I have more productive TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am doing television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season, I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days sometimes four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three entries, which are simultaneously in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how to Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">Around the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not just produced, so still obendous. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans of the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, a business or a classroom to take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not only around the computer, and imaginative, and it is true if I say, I understand that it does not dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened to work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set troops up when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as a result, you have a high tone, lying a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and rational, and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go forever on her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people take if I declare to them the buzz that I'm talking to writing that writing to me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I started working with TV production as I began to work and work, build and working together, I discovered this thing, this totals, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The money is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the money is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the money is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you cannot aspire to be different than size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different than aspire to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is the ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know that I did not go for failure, and I know only that I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it in question.</seg>
<seg id="632">In order to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more hibernate, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more things you observe, the more I'm writing history, all the more expectations there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I have created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the money. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, hidden.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz halted.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single workman.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "estimate, I want to go to Shonda Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The money did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hour days, worked out weekends, no repentance, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps not, does not exist, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what makes you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul you out, stupid author-Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you work, you love what you do, you love to be a teacher, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the buzz feels, if you didn't know the buzz, if you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states" waitress "Ask a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way to the outside, late and she says," "" "Mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things are aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I forgot it when I am Titan and my buzz is sad, and here everything is changing in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and play their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book" "" "Everybody poops." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing exceptional.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of Summens, I can do nothing except to adjust.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land that I have created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, waiter-pens and the song in which it's going to let go, or whatever the girl leaves in "The kingfishin."</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me is redeemed.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes into and a energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is soft, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium environment, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">When I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe me with broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not a force and it is not a job-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums of money depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the river which comes from life spirit.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums of money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real sums ignores the pressure of history, that enlightening tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real sums of God is God's voice in my ear, but maybe I whispered God the wrong words, for what God said to me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, a lot more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a solid rule, so that I can rid myself as a workaholic from any guilt.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice but if I want to hear the sums again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so simple. I am not good in games, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not about to work ansatzweise as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work as well as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a person is working better than to be at home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed, none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We Displatzen Seifeninflen.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always after my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children tell me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever ceased with playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you can hold me for naïve, for a dreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You are right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they monds that they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienbad or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage daughter all 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more requires not.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes a bit, even at a bad-like day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children begged.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is considered to feel the buzz to have a place for his soul's peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I fail and I victories. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "want to play?" "" "is just for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training as I wanted to exceed myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not get full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working not without play.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear a UFO melody, she meets me and my soul. she forwarding me to new ideas. I redirects it to his way. I use it in full and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap blisters and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The buzz of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to work and play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfire are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the money. the land that I am scared to the marathon which I rune, the forces, the canvases, the high sound, the buzz, the other, the right sums: the sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this money the more makes this unusual, contested, naked, and new feeling of feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things out, I get you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>

<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe violation of the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was working in neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Sure they have heard of one of the most famous, the "deep-irrational stimulation." in doing so, you implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to affect the circuits of the neurons so that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease, suffering from heavy trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not imply Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was Chief of ophthalmologist and working day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I received patients with skull-stags trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You need to imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain rolls and the skull pressure is inclined.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to reduce the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, you sometimes have to remove a portion of the clouds of brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the peaked brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a rifle, is comparable to all small children that are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to flourish them.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts there were Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you are still aware of the biology lesson that stem cells unripe cells, which can transform itself into any cell type of organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain these kinds of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells have kept different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were slowly and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells, but did differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our big-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they care for the removal of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing some potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to look like a piece of brain mass from the nonlingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then select coloured, in order to be able to pursue them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implanted it at the near of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autootranoptation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we remitigate these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells into brain brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that after a few weeks they disappeared as if they were taken again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not be used, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we had an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to observe below the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence that they show are these small points. these are the cells, which we inherited in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">As they achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motoric cortex the manual level.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralysed, they could no longer move her hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they recover to some degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the ape, which recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original power from before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now you see when we replanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the irritation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still being implanted with human beings.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human being.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: take a look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trial. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to start the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It needs a long time to select patients to perform and evaluate treatments if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You really need to point out that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as a inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchanging spirits.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have demonstrated no doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "indeed, the democracy comes with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections - not to influence austerity programs that were realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought it might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my officers who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished, if they would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point, I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you to believe in cooperation with me, to believe Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a trusting and defencelestial democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy, our societies are worshipped, our future is dark and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin summit" "" "Paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain mountain, who throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the debt mountain,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its sceptics.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, however, are too anxious to invest it there where it could be productive and income that you could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, a 3,4 trillion US dollar have been invested in the US, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, streets, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds much money until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do, except the stock blower and the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">So debt and unproductive capital make up the twin summit, which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-old in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, which could not invest in an end-loop the pessimism of investors who could not invest in. exactly as Odipus Father, who might be true that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted the circumstances leads, which lead to that Odipus kills him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedly art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy a solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we understand by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form, in which the open and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed off naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be an error to mint the significance of Athenian democracy because of these conclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">"" "" "" "the decision on the Athenian democracy was and is that they gave the working poor, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gives them the right to political co-determination with equal voicing in questions of the state of state." ""</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long been held --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, that lights very bright, it is also quickly spread.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today our liberal democracies do not have their roots in the ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenic democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta who ultimately was a statute for mistress.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy came up only when a full separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process was established upon policy, while the economy is -- the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies today, the separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, while the economy is gradually undermined the policy and deprived them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians do not have so much earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you can still be in the government today and still don't believe in power because the power of politics is drafted into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think it's about just like a herd of carnivores, which thus sustains the animals, of which they nourished, decimated that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy, which the policy has so far known that it grows through the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are increasing, inequality is rising, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are to be scared to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism disdrives the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and the welfare of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">"" "if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy and it would be better if the" "" "demos" "" "control, just as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners." ""</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't sound good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position like in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-gloomy driven by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation will be higher, the waste of waste, and social conflicts deeper, just as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we need to reconstruct the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in doing so we respect the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a pathic monitoring of hyperautocracy that lets the film" "" "matrix" "" "as a documentary." ""</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism has produced the technical achievements that he has produced, will survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">The most interesting question is whether capitalism is defined by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix" or by something that the society serve in "Star Trek" in which machines serve people and people to invest their energy into the exploration of the universe, or to a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what does it mean, how could it look like this "Star Trek" like utopia rather than the "matrix" -similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you a few examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is working just -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then, all incomes come from capital and from redeeming and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees working there, which the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and austerity, and ultimately no uplifting point summit.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of the entire humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">"" "keep in mind that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" "" "the cosmos" "", "in units of" "" "cosmos" "" "-- and each government is paying the sum that matches the trade deficit or the surplus of the respective country into a common fund." ""</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund has been invested in "green" technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investments are scarce.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference proposed in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time not the technical means had to be implemented.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberating, in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all, it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography themselves as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do not, technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand, what Larry Summers are called "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just as Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wiring, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein that said. BG: in your talk, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers, you have said very clearly what you can hold from the West's view to China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my presentation, we have limited the democracy to politics while the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say so provocative that China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect to liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development concerned.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can observe now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">"" "" "" "China now proposing what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of violent after hypocrisy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as a finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely, to say goodbye to the complacency and the constant denial is that a massive slowing line went through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">"" "" "" "we had the opportunity to be based on the Greek proposal -- the way the first proposal was, who revealed this denial to be revealed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to be the denial.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If one tries to get an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism into life, it will perhaps delay a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we don't change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Naturally I have made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions caused by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to concede that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "there is worse than during" "" "Great Depression" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "neither from the Troika of creditors which has imposed on us this policy, and one:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite of aggressive ties of the conversations, you seem to be quite a pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they did not survive, the unjustified flow of forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "this will not only have disastrous consequences for Europe but for the entire world economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to hit the path of a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will be also detrimental to the future of Europeans, as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although it is likely to be held responsible for 22-mid minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading clerk at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as "Films, TV, Technology, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard converted industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV-series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are at the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"" "these are shows like" Breaking Bad "" "" Game of Thrones, "" "" The Wire "" "," "" "" The Wire "" "," where, after having watched a season, your brain asks, "" "" Where are there more of these episodes? "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows how" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras," "" "-- this should tell you enough what is going on at that end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not forget to get on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to refrain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average payout, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so doing something, that's why Roy Price wants to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and chosen by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then it produces the first episode of each of these shows and put them online, where they can view everyone free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, do you understand, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are looking at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they don't know they will be observed when watching this shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watching by Roy and his team who will accommodate everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You comprehend when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skips or reviewing it.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to determine with these data then what show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and it yields the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this bend 7.4 is and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a little different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a contest, he and his team have looked at the available data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they went a wagon and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this bend. so exactly where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, is the question: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very funny, data reversible companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">We are optimized for very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The Mindest thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so this is something frightening because we live in a time when we have more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that is even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If any one is in the USA in prison and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results generated. this is not because a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even if the data is irreversible companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009, Google announced that it is predicted by data analysis export of flu, the bad way, predicting -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success was made in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year around year, until there was suddenly no longer working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it simply wasn't working, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data reversible companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these mistakes the data obtained in decisions of life - at the workplace, in case of regulation, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as to make the decision for cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or developing a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do mostly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a result, you put this problem into its parts, so you can analyse the items; as a while you put the items back together to put a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to compose the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is uncomplete, to take a good decision -- especially when it's the brain's brain.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they used data and mind where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they would otherwise not have been able to use them. but the decision on how to put all these parts again and make it a show like "House of Cards" which was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"" "they used data to control all their decisions, first of them as they were" "" "Alpha House" "" "as they chose" "" "Alpha House" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong if data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only need to shake the ball to get an answer." most probably "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will leave it later with a technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it through something much higher, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still paying off, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">In the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
