Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which will change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt , where people should encounter young people today .
a pit chapel , which is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers for the first reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to come .
it &apos;s annoying if land@@ cards are not currently available .
that knows everyone who had already been working on an upright position , because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a str@@ ing@@ road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historical maps of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an offer of the Ge@@ o @-@ Portal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria of the State Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are anything but up to date - but that is why it is very complex . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it is clear how cities and villages in the area of Munich &apos;s spread @-@ area have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ pp@@ ings that one does not recognise as such .
in the large overview map for cities and par@@ ishes more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ tional blades were incorporated .
these ar@@ isen according to the Bavarian Government administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and exp@@ elled the first Ver@@ messung Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ alist war with Austria .
Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ograph@@ ical picture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops ended with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbour , which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ograph@@ ical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Government administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tions@@ blatt for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the other on the website of the Bay@@ er@@ isches Landes@@ bibliothek zu Munich .
the comparison of the morning / today is most impressive at the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling , 21 years after the creation of the map , 1877 , as the Munich part of Munich , was incorporated .
today sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Austria are concentrated in 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in writing o@@ uns a small @-@ minute card with dozens lines and numbers : hand@@ written flute @-@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine view &quot; which the base tax was derived .
small par@@ c@@ els currently occupy no farmers anymore but small gar@@ dener of the complex &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is spread north of under@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 swing of the October fes@@ ts , was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional leaf , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ dar not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or of the height &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , you once again drive people with madness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; built at the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard passed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist who was brought to death by King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s VII .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended the dressing of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also allowed the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ dar , who has engaged in an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt .
for 280 patients first had been space , later on 500 places was expanded .
at some point , this capacity also reached no longer - the reason for the construction of the circular anstalt in hair 1905 .
since 2006 the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um München @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest Psych@@ i@@ atri@@ en Germany .
the camp site of the former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt are now meeting young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training .
West is the football ground of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of the dwell@@ ings of the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 the children &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was set up in ar@@ quit@@ ec@@ ation in the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt during World War II during the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Marien@@ platz was around 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the merchant road was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies , in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English institute , small business buildings and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once placed on the Marien@@ hof , where these days the pre @-@ work and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ ade are made for the second S @-@ railway line .
with the slide , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
civil rights published travel warning for Mis@@ souri
the national union of the promotion of colored has issued a warning for colored men who travel due to discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ souri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state Mis@@ souri , which is to come into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to bring attention to the state , as a series of frag@@ worthy , r@@ apping @-@ based incidents in recent times occur and here , &quot; said it is in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination , as well as the prosec@@ utor of the state that dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; they have injuries of citizens &apos; rights that happen to men .
they are pulled together because of their skin colour , they are merged or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group noted incidents like rac@@ ist arres@@ ts against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no gasoline had no gasoline during the journey and was taken away by the police of Mis@@ souri , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also pointed out a recent report of the Office of the General Assembly of Mis@@ souri , which is shown that black motor@@ ists are more common in the state 75 percent more common than White .
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; said Chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready whether there are che@@ wing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ souri recorded 100 @-@ hate @-@ hate in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ line reporting programme of the F@@ BI , which ranks the state with respect to the number of such injuries at the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri law which would make it more difficult to cover a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously the American Civil Rights Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published tours for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws , the local criminal authorities ple@@ dge to impe@@ de people due to mig@@ rate clas@@ hes , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U to further re@@ funds .
travelling war@@ es are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States .
Wei@@ ghts project is elementary
the fishing bach Wei@@ ght @-@ Project is a success project and continues in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundest@@ ags Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac gave himself a picture on site .
at the right @-@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U local feder@@ ations met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two parliament@@ arians .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann first gave insights into its operation , where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 cows , and also many young animals , and in five apartments resort hosts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ ald@@ milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative way market for the milk of his cattle , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the resort only govern@@ ment@@ ales .
since he is also BL@@ H@@ V @-@ president of Fisch@@ bach , he was the consecr@@ ating project as an &quot; spontaneous project . &quot;
I can act on such steep areas not profitable .
the green area is for a lot of work , much must be edited with the engine sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operations and managed this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not lead a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subtle project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
costs of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are would have to be supported by farmers .
we hope that the winding of the areas will be pushed out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure that we have , are people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the support
in 2013 there were a total of 25 plots of eleven participants in 2013 .
the closing area is 40 hectares , which can not be picked up until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter contributed to the municipality of fishing villages .
in this way , farmers have to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady does not go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter white stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ es ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state support of past@@ ure @-@ law@@ ns .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black @-@ Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR was awarded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the en@@ closure surface may not be sli@@ pper@@ able ( Hang@@ ne@@ ment over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fishing and past@@ oral project 2018 , 2018 is currently running the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build under 16 kilometres fence .
the closing area corresponds 35 hectares , the cold costs are more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime changes is it when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the gro@@ omed down@@ fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ is Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ ré@@ g@@ ime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic b@@ xt in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to the dras@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have disgu@@ ised him if he had done it .
but he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance he was written as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base was added .
as Miller Ab@@ co@@ sta , I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem which you refer to , that is later added and is not part of the original freedom of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is correct correctly , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about story .
it is about contemporary resonance on the moving words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immig@@ rant , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your nat@@ ured , your poor , / your depres@@ sed masses who year@@ n to breathe , free to breathe , / to destroy the waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not committed in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death on the base - were very good that they accomplished a high political act .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , showing the female embodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract , she has obtained a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change from the right wing already long .
the great cry as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty , was argu@@ ing that the Statue of Liberty is not an early Ne@@ o@@ conservative that bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding .
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not supposed to enligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something razor .
the importance of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was in them to see them as they did from the exhaustive but hope@@ ful people after lengthy and often terrible trips on the Dec@@ ks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense it is about seeing the world from the perspective of men who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognize .
their tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the path but hatred that is their only source of power to ign@@ ite .
world Cup 2017 : Neil Black commen@@ ced Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle reminds itself of a time when only two sco@@ oters were to the team of Great Britain .
the Director of the L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member states had a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; said Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was chosen by the crew to the team of team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
your cap@@ tures speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sh@@ ot@@ tish , or wherever they live or train , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie made quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver medal , which will compete at its fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dles , says that it is &quot; incredible , &quot; that 16 heads in the British team are .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championships was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ ir &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conduc@@ ts on this path and has set up five British and two European records last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 metres of rounds .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which one should observe , after a great season , which were included in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
he was reminded of her first World Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell .
the teams cap@@ tives say that they are &quot; very proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases they are also involved with the medals and the fin@@ ite .
&quot; the special thing to be part of the team is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so it was anyway great honour but to know that my team mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the car@@ rots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it just shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums .
what my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
it is therefore really important to get on this home support and benefit from that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block cri@@ tically on Facebook : don &apos;t you get a public office if you cannot wear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew anything of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers smote him because of everything , from internal policy to its political principles .
he swe@@ eps with criticism , sure .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid as the sheep were led to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Maryland to governor Lar@@ ry Hog@@ an who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Rights Union compl@@ ained him at the beginning of this week .
the rod of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a bac@@ kl@@ ash reaction with &quot; Na , and ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a type like Hog@@ an .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Hog@@ an is not a reactionary Hitler head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the block@@ ade of individuals who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially named and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post def@@ aul@@ ted Ho@@ al spokes@@ woman Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the block@@ ade of the comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ lling or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ ting people who vibr@@ ate online the wh@@ ip .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by the Hog@@ an .
and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments are respectful , thoughtful and not profound .
the pastor saw the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ dge Catholic faith .
Law@@ y@@ tin &apos;s Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted , but she asked for hate @-@ hate .
&quot; I comment@@ ed that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate @-@ hate and other recent news , &quot; wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; The post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people takes place on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some more than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors are called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking or a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in previous time when you had the same done that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tors and burn demonstr@@ ators and to be sil@@ enced and sil@@ enced .
but this is exactly what happens digital .
Hog@@ an is not the first public official to be critic@@ ised for it that he vacc@@ inated Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is lo@@ dged by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ n County is the first First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. districts James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at present Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ ing proposed to his leadership .
and even then Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the people , the pseudon@@ y@@ me such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
peti@@ tions , which critici@@ zed his point of view on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and navigation with Britain critici@@ zed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he has not been sil@@ enced .
freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days at home comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led next year next door in Arch@@ er@@ field links to the end @-@ round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new place of affairs and acts as a tournament ban on behalf of the club &apos;s founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how the ren@@ aissance Club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state .
Jerry made a great job than he did this place .
he is a eager swee@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the British E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won the European tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the native player in South@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was last year after I gained it from the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from the last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win .
it was a really special time and one we always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who died after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year for the European Senior Tour , returns to the promotion of the home town .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about the way it went . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by pas@@ siv@@ ity
over the past two decades , fewer people have died of lung cancer in the last two decades .
this result is the scientists of the University of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer of the pas@@ siv@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Studien@@ leiter Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he moved to this subject from 1994 .
back then , there was still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary b@@ lown cases due to pas@@ v@@ rau@@ ds per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
car@@ vings prove to be very complex
construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; lie somewhat in the time , &quot; says the manager of the Bau@@ haus Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the field of household caps the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground much se@@ amounts , which is not noticeable in the plans .
the traffic , which is repeatedly ham@@ pered the construction work , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red amps and un@@ locks is already enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the service buses are eligible for transit .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai regul@@ ator in the un@@ troubled province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually refers to a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the shortened tu@@ ber will be taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the arm@@ our - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .

Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one w@@ ns it after 17 o &apos;clock in the village &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia as only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ ders to vote before the occupation of occupation .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta who maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or jurisdictions .
in 2003 the province was divided into Papua and West Papua , with autonomous part of Papua New Guinea .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura after Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transportation .
the town with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bam@@ boo towers , and from cor@@ rug@@ ged roofs that have been converted through r@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown notes .
very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , refused because journalists and practically no foreigners .

&quot; earlier we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst children &apos;s economic and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land .
the biggest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a scenic provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port has built worth € 3.@@ 1 billion in gold and copper alone in 2015 .
in addition , Papua with wood resources in the value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
however , this riches are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia of Mary &apos;s em@@ powering military preserved a sti@@ cking presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military spending and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ sian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this Golden G@@ ans and will be treated mer@@ c@@ il@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 and de@@ tained .
Mass@@ ent@@ an@@ ians in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal @-@ state in the 1970 @-@ he @-@ years were referred to in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to commit genocide .
the Indones@@ ian police in the region alone used more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we value the Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in a report of the Archbishop Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bol@@ ts have been reinforced since Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian but the demographic development changes , as Muslim economies of the popul@@ ous Islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come .

&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved into the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has the native Papua New Mama for the women &#93; of Papua ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua ) &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the Volk@@ sm@@ al and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke to the inequalities and the violations of infrin@@ gements in Papua during his election campaign .
the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua New has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts have broken , because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered just two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October a low point .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas Eve in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness .
the spar@@ ed children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an increase in their tone and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and smote the group with their tissues , they said victim and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby Government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
approximately 1,000 young Papua , women and children gathered together on a football field in front of the local police centre and the military commander centre to demand justice .
they bore cerem@@ onial hunting hunting and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a du@@ b@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag bricks on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot it dead , &quot; it says in an official document of T@@ IME , which has not been released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the elevated risk and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the porch of his multic@@ ol@@ oured wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let from the ranks of the soldiers gathered together .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots .
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ians only bear a name , the T@@ IME in dark atmosphere .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the Che@@ glo@@ spec@@ tor of Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said repor@@ ters that his officers &quot; wanted to secure their station &quot; because they are attacked .
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ us to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 .
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only at the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he vo@@ iced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wor@@ e the historical abnorm@@ alities in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case immediately solved , so that there will no longer happen in the future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he would judge an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for the con@@ vent of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the words began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most violations occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then , Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he said on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said , he did not have plans to set a complaint mechanism in Papua .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , who accused the UN because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua were already authorized , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed imp@@ unity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital died a person and 17 others have been injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ w@@ ned when he was caught in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
the villagers were prot@@ esting in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police told that the villagers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted by using war@@ ts .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and kill a kill .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured has been delivered quickly here , so T@@ IME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the di@@ ke @-@ parliament has called to account the participating officers and withdraw the mobile brig@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai has always been a jer@@ king for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensible development rein@@ forces the dis@@ satisfaction of the tribal members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by pushing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
in recent years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai over the past few years , under the pretext of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ aries and fruit and vegetables vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ien ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
in the course of time , economic inequalities between native Papua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new flight routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in greater numbers .
the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent immigrants .
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Basi@@ lle Long@@ ch@@ amp were ported because of lack coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to films .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign were to raise the limitations of reporting , to promote transparency and development , not realized .
&quot; there are new threats to foreign journalists who try to report from Indones@@ ian un@@ troubled provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua . visa ref@@ usal and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March they called for six paci@@ fist states - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to examine the &quot; different and widespread injury &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still there is a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited on May 4 , bra@@ ked natives , their silence and printed him . &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Papua would probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the permanent threat of a rob@@ ber@@ ian army , is located in poor educ@@ ators and health services .
Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the threats and inti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai s@@ uss@@ sion led a final symbolic act of Des@@ pair : the body of a victim was buried in a complex opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not let those responsible for crimes are not forgotten .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with mir@@ r@@ alled head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai , its penetr@@ ated and forced hundreds of residents , from which 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building to flee .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps only two years through the Hoch@@ haus which is called random the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stood at the fire @-@ raid and in the cry of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the staircase , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident , which his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dub@@ ais civil defen@@ ders said that the units of the fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , they work on providing accommodation for those concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials that are used throughout the world in external areas of skyscrapers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages from the dis@@ guise , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came .
Britain said the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and dis@@ guise on the London Gren@@ fell @-@ tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a brand@@ y , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis courts ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by its large Davis Cup Cou@@ p during the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting was the support for this sport @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City , who only has to play two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin does not support the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the fact often very long , but even therefore very cher@@ ished Five @-@ set @-@ classics will be preserved the sense of tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states vote for the reform , the objective of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , was therefore only short missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our membership nation@@ alists have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the results .
not only for the vote was , according to many verses , the proposal had already come to a neutral place .
new starting on 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will be in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup next year in the first round the host law .
in order to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in training places are relie@@ ved etc . and the players will be able to complete the Davis Cup less official media appointments .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers har@@ b@@ ted objects to the plane , find out a survey
a survey conducted among passengers found that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ consciously left items to control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , who wor@@ shipped the aircraft while they were acci@@ dentally prescribed kni@@ ves or other objects with blade .
less than 1 per cent claimed , they had bel@@ ated that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey with more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also noted that younger travelers are more aware of the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the assur@@ ances that they did not know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were inten@@ tionally subject to T@@ SA agents were processed foods and liquids .
more than 3 per cent gave to know@@ ingly know@@ ingly have borne items with Klin@@ gen through the security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirm that they would have been inten@@ tionally brought fro@@ sted drugs to the plane .
the company said it was asked for travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally brought s@@ mug@@ gling goods by the airport safety and how many it would have been inten@@ tionally done .
it is not a surprise that people who are most likely to wear or im@@ know@@ ingly - by security , those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA policies are a bit complicated and confusing .
people are often uncertain what liquids they are allowed to take on or how much of it .
so it is not a surprise that the largest amount of the goods conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden .
for a period of time the people , the T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mug@@ gling .
liquids is allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to give the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so far , he said so far , that a part of the customer has already withdrawn her non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ hal@@ es numbers to sales boo@@ sts and even more gigantic off @-@ off target , Tes@@ la @-@ Chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has betrayed for the first time a different , less striking number : the cancellation of the cancell@@ ations in the new mass market model 3 .
in the past few months , Mus@@ k has used more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now , Mus@@ k is one : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn .
critics were always advised that this is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
in a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; complete .
at present , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations before , cleared up Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that the cancellation of up to now about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader doesn &apos;t believe .
its argument : the challenge for ambitious growth goals is not in demand , but on the production site .
in the past year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4.000 vehicles were made .
2018 : all models have to be assembled - 500@@ ,000 , 2020 one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , currently a day of 1800 reservations are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must be reck@@ oned in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la makes it possible to drive its brand @-@ new , even never in practice , without larger interrup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , it comes to greater delays , then the in@@ sol@@ ub@@ ility of making reservations for the problem for tes@@ la will become .
because then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA Chef P@@ ru@@ itt goes back to reducing emissions from the Obama &apos;s rules to reduce emissions
one day after having been lo@@ dged by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities towards more responsive than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not test the law@@ suit filed against his previous place in a state of occupation .
it is a deadline that ran down on 1 October for states to keep the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ es o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay compliance with a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere with local decisions or impe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma for a long time been a reliable ad@@ versaries of environmental protection regulations .
since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to blocking or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts Reg@@ ular Roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Constitutional Court decided that the EPA administration has exceeded his authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing out of meth@@ ane cks .
in a Wednesday evening published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ gs suggested that his turn@@ around at O@@ zon@@ standards are quite simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the States by the complex process of timely meeting of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA have often kept the deadlines for carrying out and then to be accused of being accused by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement struck the appointment for the execution &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that are there to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion expressed by EPA is that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually take their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to the delay and all the others legally available &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress are pushing for a more broader new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet provided in the Senate .
the New York Consul@@ ate General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the States who had the EPA in this week , said the group intended to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reverse of EPA - according to our defeats - is an important profit for the health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tail@@ oring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York concluded in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
ground @-@ o@@ zone occurs , when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil sha@@ fts , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are responding to sunlight .
the smo@@ g smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute each year to thousands of premature death cases .
representatives of public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alists of che@@ er about P@@ ru@@ th@@ ening course change .
&quot; it is troub@@ ling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to commit themselves to environmental poll@@ uting and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 am to a Seren@@ ade .

the visitors of the sixth call @-@ Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors tum@@ ours to their request .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique village called Klein@@ od . &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg &apos;s certificate : Earl Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with which the parish church to Tum@@ lingen , including the V@@ og@@ tei &quot; an Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Die@@ tri@@ ch for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the word , according to the certificate of the certificate , there stood on the tum@@ linger mountain apart from the erst@@ while parish church also a splendid farm , to which the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ - was not true and not the other way around .
so there are also people there .
as seen from the description of the Ober@@ pf@@ ront Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that today are still visible in the village of tum@@ ours , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village .

three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ es at Christmas in 16@@ 73 .
the newly created Glo@@ cke came for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window boards were planted and the bell @-@ ile stolen .
the roof was un@@ tight .

until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from squ@@ abs .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ church broke off .
only the church tower had to be left .
in the New Year @-@ Night 18@@ 34 split a storm the church tower and the half rus@@ hed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower became dis@@ car@@ ded .
only the present Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g still remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

association aims to check permission of wind@@ wheels
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim awake , &quot; does not see a legal requirement for the construction and therefore turned towards the coun@@ sel .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ dged itself &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen just existed at the border to swal@@ m@@ tal a wind@@ force concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentr@@ ations of the concentration of wind use for the remaining urban area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these zones should prevent a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days ago , the city of Vier@@ sen was determined a second wind power station in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but that was not approved by the district government Düsseldorf , because of a form@@ id@@ ler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of scheduled legal requirement , the un@@ divided permits , and therefore also res@@ ign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council set again the wind concentration zone in Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; an approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; experience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the place where the approval of a licence for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has entered into the circle four times since the past week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to examine the matter again .
but they are not likely to perform that the procedure is stopped .
with a view of the ongoing trial in the administrative court , the circle on Thursday didn &apos;t want to express themselves in terms of the argum@@ entation of the Club Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four per 200 meters high wind@@ wheels .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved , stro@@ lling with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large terrain .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power supply needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to a fifth of the electricity demand of all quadru@@ ple households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer four summ@@ ers gave a green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park L@@ inn@@ i near Aachen , and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor cr@@ acks along : Frau dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one terrible traffic accident takes on Friday afternoon at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Low @-@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn ) .
a woman was killed in it .
two other people were easily injured .
the provincial road was locked over hours .
after police officers , a 17 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ n@@ ich took their cars in line with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as companion , the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and traders are planning &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ ector and people from the region are to be re@@ discovering the shopping facilities in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants of the shopping bum@@ ble@@ bee in the city centre .
as the chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; home of shopping &quot; -@@ weekend to sensi@@ tise the customer for this , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket commodity .
planned , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their educational places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite for the &quot; MI@@ age at night @-@ shopping . &quot;
the promotion of action is not only on residents of the city and the near@@ er region .
in preparation of being commerci@@ als on the radio , a internet video and printed bag , that point out on the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King .
municipal administration and industrial association cooperate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
in this way the industrial association and the city go into another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; project .
these include new offers such as the first &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest with selling so@@ ff@@ in Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to take them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the disclaimer on parking fees in this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re@@ developed or developed again .
these include short guests and tourists .
but also many locals have lost the city center while shopping from the view .
at the end everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven the city center - to landlords , the factories around the city and associations .
it sailed with a network the Le@@ th@@ arg@@ ie to overcome the share had made king in spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , Leit@@ ner of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared that there will be five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities in the country , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and make its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK organisation and with many partners will also make a clear that every citizen can influence in itself with its purchase behaviour .

a first mis@@ ses later was also found dead @-@ born .
in the dead it was a question of the school .

Tr@@ ump continued after penetr@@ ated trans@@ cription by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump was calling for Tr@@ ump in a telephone with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to , to tell us publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US President compl@@ ained him , because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . he said to him , &quot; This is what you cannot say to the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and sul@@ try to leave Mexico for the project .
trans@@ cription of his first attempt with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m g@@ ums were also published and un@@ reported a tense exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. sne@@ ak , that an trade for the USA refugees who mig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that the bri@@ dging on trade , which was given by the Obama Administration to look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , having said Mr Turn@@ around , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ er Ford @-@ Mass@@ acre : activists guide rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice back on
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ink to the Ford Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men joined with guns to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long train to his cig@@ ar and looked up by the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ w the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams t@@ apping the silence , when a young black man was car@@ ded from the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , only a post .
but if a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone threw in the audience a real si@@ gh .
since 2005 citizens are back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one has ever been indicted for the murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ detec@@ table that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a black@@ out on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former congress of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
for him the im@@ position serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community , that a fault has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want to heal , but first we must receive righteousness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court of court has a du@@ cloth on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on 27 July 1946 .
according to F@@ BI &apos;s files , which were received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding Graf@@ sions were v@@ apor@@ ated in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but no one has ever been indicted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , we say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice of the black citizens in Georgia for the first time in the summer to vote their voice in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to information from the F@@ BI of the black colour@@ ing Roger Mal@@ com a white land owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried , not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land owners , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when she went away from the prison and approached the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b became the car .
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , which prepared and arranged the mor@@ row , &quot; closing a F@@ BI report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between the state and local authorities , which was not only involved in the murder of the murder and the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks make it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a voting mass@@ acre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and vote , then you will happen here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has guided the annual post @-@ term of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her portra@@ yal is vi@@ cious , in@@ comprehensible and is based in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America no longer exists .
it is hard to watch , and to look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen because we then face it with its ug@@ liness into all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the black - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed , as Gre@@ ene launched a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ board for many years , but he said the role I will never become easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester play their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and aff@@ liction , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; d &apos;@@ er , disappeared from my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona inv@@ aded the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lau@@ rel .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still recep@@ tive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that white people at that time are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n --- &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black performers .
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and just there , the energy shifts in space , a sense of the cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaced the discomfort .
everyone is busy doing this correctly , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed men .
the scene begins again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ prints .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , clo@@ th@@ ed with a funer@@ al dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and carries Billi@@ e Holidays griev@@ ing &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
her voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators of sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only the road down .
they have experienced every nearly eight hours of Georgia , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have stayed with anec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand on the same country , where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de is taking place , the air feels donated .
when the last notes came out of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ected the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing to each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wants to remember it .
after a few minutes I would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ se@@ il away and wi@@ pe her tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the train , who has played the C@@ lan@@ er .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aced two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually aband@@ ons with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done this for one reason . &quot;
later the audience deals with the actors for dinner together .
at a table chat a white pair of Atlanta is excited about the im@@ position with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words what feeling the performance has left .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and that do what they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks farm holds on his table , he eats and reminds of citizens &apos; rights .
he said he already began to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adjustment is inspir@@ ational in some way , because it describes the horror of what we have to endure , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is like that if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .
whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
even in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ floor setting .
the torque stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a s@@ hab@@ by street corner with mas@@ onry and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ley &quot; logo from GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that he par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer that pos@@ ing the Rhein@@ k@@ chter as rock @-@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an I@@ setta .
Gest@@ apo Oil sp@@ ans remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - Money , Power and greed - which draws itself through his &quot; ring &quot; staging .
the three Rhin@@ k@@ ills - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren as already in the &quot; Rhin@@ eland &quot; wonderful .
they perform Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ ush in Hollywood man@@ ians a cor@@ pse in the trunk area and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo cli@@ que .

brutal the scene , when he complic@@ ates Sieg@@ fried .
later he has to believe in favor of Gun@@ ther ( Markus E@@ iche ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause .
stor@@ my will be celebrated Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ ov@@ sky , who are modest and exploited hands on Merkel @-@ smoking .
big applause are available for the Fest@@ spiel@@ orchester , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat re@@ movable again in empty leisure clothes .
with tension was expected the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Reg@@ ie@@ team .
in 2013 he had a serious wh@@ ist@@ band to leave about himself , there were five years later great che@@ ers , in which the ins@@ ed &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; took place .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have been happy about it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown up with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I prefer a positive summary .
Max crowd works as volunteer
they work in several locations in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in Fur@@ nis@@ h , once a week I found here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked in the open whole day at school .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so that is a late volunteer .
how does that happen ?
quantity : I have made fl@@ it@@ ur .
and then a builder study , we say to be successful successfully .
I have known for me that it is the Fal@@ se for me and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected some great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will start my studies in the social work in the winter semester . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will study dual @-@ study , make sure in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social work training and studi@@ er in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not uncommon to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you can be F@@ S@@ J .
you can do it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing I had irrit@@ ated .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
other than in engineering studies ?
quantity : well clear , here it is not about reck@@ on .
you have always seen other people again , each of which have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught out of the family - you must always be in touch with it .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
great love , great kindness .
there is also negative moments , but so life is just .
Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will build further 3,000 jobs and cut their stop@@ over by 72 per cent , since another restructuring programme will be started to overcome pressure by which the company is facing .
the inter@@ locking system , the Director of John Fall@@ on mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 bodies had already been lost .
Pear@@ son announced in May in a third cost reduction program a plan for a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was taken by a quick step towards digital learning .
the company , which had expressed its involvement in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House on the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , after the first half of the year reached a increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier at the assass@@ ination attempt killed
a su@@ icide being attacked an Military kon@@ vo@@ i in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of NATO and killed several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter have been violated , an explanation of Nato .
repor@@ tedly local reports repor@@ tedly died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h part of the quarter Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that did in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide was killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a statement of NATO , it is alleged to be an explosion on Thursday night , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a group of persons impro@@ vised Spr@@ eng@@ ing . &quot;
the statement describes that all of them are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital at the airport Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a su@@ icide @-@ auto@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .

EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule to suits around
the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has made a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to crash the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was a day after 15 countries compl@@ ained the agency because of the pac@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zon@@ al 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the O@@ zone regulations - in which in a part of the country to be measured against emissions , where incis@@ ions must be made to keep stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , reached on Tuesday , law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to put a wide range of environmental regulations , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , the efforts have triggered the return of Democrats and reserves , concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce the lung function and reinforce the atoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
council wants common room
at the end the decision was clear : with two counterparts , the Common Assembly of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln , the establishment of a communal space in the future retirement homes .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing basic piece was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ades .
while the church is still going to last , until now so far the church community belonging to the church is owned , but there is no plans for a plan for a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a discussion on a common area . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the two investors who are still in the boat is offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would have a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters of area for a special price .
the Administration and the majority of the community council float above , such a community room is not as a meeting place only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ derly residential area , but openly in the church .
as an example , the word of the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap .
the decision will be decided by providing funds for the current budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities .
the construction is in the refurbis@@ hment area .
the establishment of a shared space would be so reported T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent of 30 percent combined .
the proposed proposal to sign@@ alize to the investor that one wants to cast him out in this respect no bil@@ lets between the legs , finding that both saddle stit@@ ching - which reduces the ambient level - which reduces the amount of pressure and the construction of economic power - which would be possible .
need@@ less , so do not only mean Wil@@ fred sole , be this addi@@ tive .
if &apos; s helps : unanim@@ ously , he happ@@ end the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings with which you can &apos;t move forward now , it is now in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am difficult to deal with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the common area - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a covered sub@@ vention of any firm or even foreign investors .
that is just not that , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but get a real , in doubt counter @-@ market counter @-@ equivalent , is the counter @-@ speaking .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers request , the proposed proposal to be posted accordingly , takes place three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains in two oppos@@ ites at the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ ized : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we put the decision in this way , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hiking in the Har@@ z of Stern
in the res@@ z the national &quot; star@@ ch &quot; is supposed to be developed .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary path exists in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , it was named . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he connect nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up the scheduled route along the planned route and inform about stars and star pics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations in five to six places &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ question cheese , St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ ge@@ i@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tablets are to be added via the internet .
this is why the site is playing a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a criter@@ ion .
later the star train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ door@@ way , the observer experienced a lot of knowledge , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , even though he removed significantly further .
I will also be conve@@ yed in which constellation can be a chosen star and when he is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest star of Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z is one of the six most dar@@ k@@ est regions of Germany in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda @-@ galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the university city since 2003 there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen a little similar to the planned star@@ ry - the planetary path .
beginning in front of Geb@@ a Hotel near Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads through to Hain@@ berg and for the observatory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; site in Die@@ mar@@ den ( municipality equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the cra@@ ve with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ appointed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely positioned at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ ink so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is about 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres long distances .
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians just need a good hour until St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedest@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed @-@ star but would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time , discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision event in order to staged the most exciting pit fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN @-@ Office in Los Angeles until Gar@@ cia , the uncomfortable World Bo@@ xing Council body champion , the corridor down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ spring champion .
after Gary &apos;s victory over the former four divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How does it go to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show @-@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect proportions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am asc@@ ended to Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to download on body weight .
and he has to move to Lei@@ cht@@ ower &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko has agreed to .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this struggle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be at pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy to arrange the Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 bones outs ) which also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their body @-@ weight fight in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and expressed later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
when ever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said Mr. Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he &apos;ll think the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very slow , I am sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to see the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show head@@ line , then bo@@ xing .
both they said , they might feel the momentum that built up for the own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have waited for the top fighters and this is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four Ver@@ sions to tire @-@ space
an accident on the A7 were severely injured on Thursday afternoon four people .
according to the first information , the driver lost a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 am just before the connector Office wide probably after a tire place control over his vehicle .
the truck sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he struck himself and then lying on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were partly severely injured during the accident .
during the initial supply of the injured due to the rescue service , the A7 was locked in direction north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left @-@ strip could be subject to the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes to end 2 : 2 to the season open@@ er against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as not the two oppos@@ ites were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fortuna Düsseldorf &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the chain @-@ chain is to continue to be optimized further .
and a gate after a friend , the Fort@@ ims are no longer willing to catch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ensing ) puts on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team has even better cope with the experience in preparation for the three chain than with the four chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his Trainer Fried@@ man Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is confident of his matter , &quot; because we are currently working on semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , but , that we do not harmon@@ ize even better and we cannot afford to do so many play@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one cannot speak after a draw on a mis@@ directed start , do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a neat season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the season I only take after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ land Fun@@ kel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off because of an accident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann believes that players from Au@@ e might even be some fresh as they had no he@@ avier and complete game like Fortuna against a tick bites in the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know so 100 % where they currently stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the guests come from Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite on Sunday at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we leave them away , just because we have the right to come under the first side , is blocks sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose balance sheet in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you must hit by for@@ n@@ ly , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Chef coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and hetero@@ geneous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ application tests published
the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of those tested people older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ ic medicine ( puzzle @-@ medic@@ ally inter@@ ket ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they should make the assessment of the ages more accurately during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration Authority ( migration flows ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were poor .
until today , migration flows in 6.@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to test@@ es cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly below 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are resistant to the last months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see big difference in statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have been lied over his age .
in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the person sought 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det analysed the 5@@ 81 results found that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it will be 18 years old .
the method of medical age assessment , in the X @-@ rays of Weis@@ s and MR@@ I @-@ recordings of k@@ nie@@ ks are made , which then be analysed by dental crowns and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tics is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work embr@@ aces the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
if we cannot say it for sure , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult in@@ correctly .
the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 ; in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg come well .
on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was put on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Light , construction manager at the Department of street and traffic in the governing council of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the works began at the same time on all three main bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .

Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with german potato salad
it does not appear so often that parties involved join forces , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows this day peacefully because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ steiner Hall Ron@@ dell is part of the &quot; great electoral campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leaders of the Bundestag on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Executive Officer of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event are not wanting to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ drivers but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally the city pic@@ n@@ ics was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now finds in the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who are going to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , president of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him .
the police have frequented many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence above all at the station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how is the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported from the Af@@ for@@ et@@ ei@@ fel area , he tries to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was asked at first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because because of the already built @-@ in pavilion , not enough parking spaces are available .
well the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
looking at the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this also does it : against 8 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz offers a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ Alger@@ ian Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 audiences that are waiting for the leaders of the Federal Chancellor , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ ty of Stor@@ ch to keep their speeches .
unchanged is the police force , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
slightly more than an hour will be the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is up to 21 p.m. there .
the police can wage - no special incidents .

both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of many international competitions as well as have sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European leaders .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ m@@ pe@@ ter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ t of the SW@@ R Symph@@ on@@ ie@@ Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments , but also merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
Johann Sebastian Bach at the two sounds like in a new gar@@ ment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &apos; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ az@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ ate N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free games to an intrigu@@ ing total artwork .
this core of the program was first listed this spring with enormous success in Freiburg .

Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ber@@ ality
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it to the end of their lives .
but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart all openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; once I sat down in gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; .
the well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ ric stars was the cause of her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ ry , which ultimately diver@@ ging bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this assured the brunette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with anyone I &apos;ve posted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think about , I would have played ? &quot;
after her separation , Kr@@ isten gave to her that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism .
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot;
especially among them I suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in the school @-@ time , as they preferred like a bu@@ b cle@@ ide@@ te : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
this really has hurt me very badly .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think of me : &apos; girls &apos; be proud of you ! &apos; .
especially the public they don &apos;t like to live their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain manner and anno@@ yed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me a sc@@ ant but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the entire public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a rally with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer I would say it is time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke a big announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endorse the democratic nom@@ inee Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal min@@ ors in five states , and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime the Republi@@ can National Committee gave an explanation in which it said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is another blow to a democracy party that would rather than working towards us to make our country great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history the announcement of Gover@@ nor is merely the last rejection of a party that is from top to down without guidance , and is unable to find a positive , pur@@ ified message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair@@ men Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ e lo@@ aves &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised by Thursday what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be added to the sport again .
Russian L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut off with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ground@@ ing that was imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) was found evidence of stat@@ eless D@@ oping in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; IA@@ AF President Co@@ e said the re@@ por@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and do everything possible to make sure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accept the criteria for his re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress was made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added
ninth Russian athletes will start at the athle@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
Dro@@ gent@@ leman is still inadequate and forbidden coaches are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council .
funer@@ al act for in Mali see@@ ded soldiers
at a funer@@ al party at the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ischen Frit@@ z@@ lar have thought about 1000 people of the two in a helicopter crash in Mali .
the ceremony took place on Thursday at the cathedral town under high safety precautions .
to the still un@@ resolved abnormal , defense ministers said Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two inver@@ ted pilot but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kings of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow@@ ed us from this highest victim , which they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen were alive a week ago in the West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a total guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Saint Peter .
at mid@@ day , only the members of the Church were farewell .
after that , the funer@@ al party began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
grape @-@ past@@ ed rose @-@ ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the S@@ är@@ gen .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers watched the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense minister of Le@@ yen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decorated soldiers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the staff @-@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the combat h@@ ub@@ bers tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with and be one of the first six trained tiger @-@ pilots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Commander of the Regim@@ ent , to which the soldiers belong , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , then it would not have been wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali was not a prime minister in the Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country , separated by only two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funer@@ al party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be sto@@ cked , the Bundes@@ wehr has no indications .
prince Hen@@ rik wants a grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , his death will not be buried next to his wife .
this shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish king is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already made a coff@@ kop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was going to be in the communication .
where prince Hen@@ rik bury , be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home country .
prince Hen@@ rik never had a heart@@ felt that he was not happy with his title .
after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he went to retirement and also puts the title &apos; Princ@@ ge@@ ma@@ hl . &quot;
since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he didn &apos;t want to see himself compared to his wife - also not after death , declared L@@ ene b@@ alle@@ by , the manager of the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , be still unclear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked in the French embassy in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand during his barely 50 years of reign .
in an auto@@ biography vo@@ iced Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival everything I did .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ str@@ amps instead of stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who in this country had the reputation , the brand of soci@@ alistic intellectuals could not be hoped for .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants swift new elections
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
precip@@ itation Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is based on the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but does not want to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke of the resolution of the Parliament on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising resignation of a Green party members from their land @-@ week in Lower Saxony , had pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official appointment of the elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover , thus lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in the parliament to the Opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ jac@@ kets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated her on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U @-@ Fra@@ tors Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to record them .
in order to have CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new land@@ tag is elected to the January 14th of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green country government must now decide whether it can continue to rule in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil does however , for indispensable , that the land@@ day decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further action .
the state of State also sees the possibility that the governor &apos;s Day takes the prime minister to withdraw his trust and choose a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally tested and tested , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will discuss all the questions in silence if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something strange &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the policy maker itself said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
it proved to be a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the de@@ vol@@ ous MP to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she has received her coun@@ tenance , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the provincial Meta Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the presidents of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision from El@@ ke T@@ jac@@ kets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in front of the background that there was no content differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transi@@ tions of the lower @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ jac@@ kets to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the constitu@@ ents and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) to release the country &apos;s day quickly .
the resignation twist red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its past van@@ ity and in their fr@@ ust their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ filtration and is trying to hit a political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
low @-@ fac@@ tual CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tors Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler aims to take its members to record El@@ ke T@@ ile into the CD@@ U .
the Leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw his west before , with personal career thinking the outcome of the election election in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U back then before the SPD is the strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a hau@@ th@@ inner majority in the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
agriculture ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ fts , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect consumers .
Minister for Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from toxic eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ing@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder provide the most recent information about the eggs .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all we know , a health haz@@ ard is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the insur@@ er of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food Surve@@ illance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has opened immediately and is located since announ@@ cing Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as well as the makers bear concern that the sold @-@ selling products are traffic @-@ capable and un@@ balanced .
if with eggs of the resi@@ dual content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not in@@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs are however sold and consumed .
this time not the operations are to blame .
do products and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
after the high level of knowledge , the production companies meet no immediate debt .
rather , it must be reck@@ oned on the basis of mut@@ in@@ comparably illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is a little control in the case of emergency .
is it only missing on the staff or on the coher@@ ent jurisdiction ?
however , there were just the official controls that have exposed the process .
however , in the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 percent .
precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the commit to the prosecution in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular Alar@@ ma with food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
the consumer &apos;s consumer and consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and effective food .
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food economy , consumer inside and consumers are rightly emp@@ ör@@ t .
through the established means manufacturer , distributors and consumers are in a situation which absolutely does not require .
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cides Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
it has to be consistent and working with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all the competent authorities , that the fact that the fact is resolved promptly and incomplete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of Football have to impact in neo @-@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ ted issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain are not disturbing .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A because the leadership organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A &apos;s UEF@@ A , mean that P@@ SG will eventually need to point out that the transfer of ne@@ ym@@ ar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to buy the Brazilian from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
P@@ SG can make sure the money loose , that Ne@@ ym@@ ar under@@ writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the rich rulers of Qatar .
associations may apply much money to the acquisition of players , but they must be controlled with legitimate inser@@ tions , which enable them to make a break @-@ on point in their on football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after its election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that associations , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ating and risky to ruin when banks or owners moved their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , you can take clubs losses in the amount of 30 million euros .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen by the presidency in the Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to keep away from excessive expenses .
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the P@@ SG has paid the buy @-@ out clause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package cup , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its Treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year deal , so it can be transferred to EUR 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the P@@ SG along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions .
the P@@ SG received an exit of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lo@@ wered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited .
the UEF@@ A is searching for clubs that might try to over@@ ride their financial review by re@@ ass@@ ed their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the P@@ SG , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income .
this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was b@@ lown by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the P@@ SG payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could come on payments of the organizational Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar .
but P@@ SG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Ambassador will become and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators can be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against P@@ SG mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to consider the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no previous talks with P@@ SG about Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of an@@ onym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the P@@ SG situation .
the last published reports show that P@@ SG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in sales of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published yet .
P@@ SG expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ous arrival is a bo@@ on for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot purchases .
the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ous way@@ mark by declar@@ ing that P@@ SG would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars last ownership of P@@ SG . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al manager arsen@@ al Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State that financed an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the Finance Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a great player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss Life in Search of a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ zer
in the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate was made for Swiss food .
now the co @-@ operation stands in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the order new .
Swiss @-@ spokes@@ person Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency SD@@ A on request of the newspaper &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will finish a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Swiss does not want to provide any information about the costs .

but more important is the advertising effect : for a s@@ og@@ gi@@ ate manufacturer , it is a prestigious job .
how many applicants are there with the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y .
however , only Swiss manufacturers are coming to question .
according to the newspaper &apos;s report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the SD@@ A , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not accessible for an opinion .
chocolate tables distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
before the Swiss finished a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Dete@@ ctive . &quot;
this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy ( The State &quot; for M@@ TV tri@@ mming ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to major things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an embodi@@ ment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .
but as a franchise , it feels like the time would be close .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for an attractive D@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by descending on the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ aged children play dirty children who grow up - they nevertheless managed to gain the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the wid@@ ows .
&quot; the official later , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults is less emotional , and his par@@ o@@ dy is about the found@@ ry principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he @-@ years such as &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; ( &quot; The hand that looked the cradle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still not forgotten .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy P@@ lot , included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always the extern@@ als are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singles &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the moments of random del@@ usion that could make this franchise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until he reaches what I want to see as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last scene the Ban@@ de will show how they will visit the Fil@@ mp@@ re@@ mi@@ ere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Dete@@ ctive &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds on a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east vs west @-@ fight @-@ icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a Romanian drama of eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main tro@@ ut - a hard @-@ hung Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ ose@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ gen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful g@@ ags about watching ( the police spends the time to look at chess in television as Americans might want to do with football ) .
and the list of famous speaker - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gny - ensures a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Dete@@ ctive &quot; is committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drummer - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask is involved - that it is often like a single one .
with six long episodes , it moves , and the com@@ edy is not quick or frequent enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Dete@@ ctive , who was neg@@ ated to a lower length , his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could better deliver , as Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f always visit American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ oured a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator was not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched out , like the Pro@@ sec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz on Friday .
15 circumcis@@ ed in the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and issued against this arrest warran@@ t .
in addition , the officials presented larger quantities marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundreds of thousands of Euros .
at the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ ties .
the two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .
at the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the ma@@ fia will be organised crime criminal , severe violence , murder and rob@@ bery and ex@@ tor@@ tion .
already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ sec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz are determined against organised drug trafficking in the South German region .
between the prosec@@ utor in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the major work on Wednesday @-@ Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
on the vis@@ h of the investigations , mainly Italian national , with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also an incident took place on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where early in the morning several shots were fired in a pub , should go to the bank account at the Ban@@ de .
how many large gaps in the for@@ eig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not arise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany have significant shortcomings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum proceedings .
the defend@@ ant for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jur@@ gen , has repor@@ tedly made aware of a media report on large gaps in the country of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the registered data could lead to some serious failures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partly serious failures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , according to ten million people with foreign nation@@ alists are collected , including about 5.5 million out of non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 external authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been well maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of people who have long been no longer in life , or of citizens who have become a German citizen and actually should not arise in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data input can significantly slow@@ ed back processes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says the report to further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics about out@@ travelling people , EU citizens are captured who would not have to travel all at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false orders led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on dealing with extinction date &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; therefore , it is in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the federal government obviously began sending refugee families with under 16 @-@ year old children back to Italy when they entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is made up of an internal paper of the Federal Council for Migration and refugees ( BAM@@ F ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it means that BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - except for infants and infants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , as the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin agreement is responsible for the refugees of the EU , which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the destination country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for reason I write the position now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy increases substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy received guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) consider these promises to be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also other EU countries would send refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the official political spokes@@ woman of the link collection in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ us because of the defects in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful recording conditions and a endangering the child . &quot;
two results achieved as a second result
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood from in Ober@@ pf@@ en@@ bach living people were already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
all ahead of Jürgen Gr@@ ule , which has now distributed over 50 lit@@ res of blood with its currently 100 donations .
traditionally the church in the meeting of the community at the multi @-@ time readiness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it &apos;s in@@ gen@@ ious how our body is laid out for it and we ap@@ plau@@ d the sp@@ end@@ ous respect that make their blood for strangers , yet un@@ selfish , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood sp@@ elling helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the geological leader of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are dis@@ car@@ ded into its components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you could benefit three people from a bleeding .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions taken in the spring in Ober@@ pf@@ en@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved with 114 spi@@ ders the second best result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change into the theatre building took over a few years ago to higher rating .
already before , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Meta um@@ ries to the multi @-@ exper@@ ti@@ sts and were awarded for fifty @-@ made bleeding .

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will likely be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation led the spec@@ ulation over a rise in excess .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that pressure on the budget would continue to continue , whereby inflation in autumn is expected to rise to almost 3 % .
but they sign@@ alized that over the next few years of interest would be necessary to breed those from Bre@@ xit to grow up inflation and she said that the credit costs may have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth @-@ economic package , which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will be time for the finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks in order to be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross national product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the Real@@ ms of households will continue to be charged to consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interest rates repeated that &quot; a certain pen@@ ing of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly greater &quot; extent than the markets expect .
the markets forecasts up the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another year 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the growth forec@@ asting below corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are expected to be predicted in May compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has retained its growth forecasts on 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound was after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to make no change after the recent dis@@ appoint growth will ste@@ aming the rising expectations on a interest rate and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to grow by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
the latest In@@ fl@@ ation@@ report provided little enthusiasm for households who will be affected by an increasing inflation and minor threat , since the tigh@@ tening is first even worse before it is repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy will not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent monetary policy in the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are forec@@ ast@@ ed up to the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also enhanced by rising demand for British goods , which is attri@@ but@@ able to the weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated to a lower consumption of consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision will come a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU @-@ vote which caused the rope of the failing .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach prices and the economy .
prior to the final verdi@@ ct of the bank to the interest rates , the call came up after a interest rate , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ ra@@ ged households , with three political decision makers in July called a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation is decreased last month by 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % although the Bank said this was expected and will be back in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said the crossing in relation to their goal of 2 % be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ aut Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent return of S@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the len@@ ders would be looking strongly to shops and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ duct are out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to pres@@ upp@@ res@@ h HIV @-@ Dro@@ ge 10,000 people
from September onwards , patients will have access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse could reduce preventive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) that can reduce the infection risk at high risk cancer by around 86 percent , now delivered from healthcare service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed last year a verdi@@ ct on the Supreme Court of Justice , which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
the book announced on Thursday had been welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon Ste@@ vens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) of this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first people who will enable the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in April 2018 .
prevention of prevention ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV transfer in infection @-@ endangered types with infection .
Pr@@ EP before taking intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or twice before intercourse .
to those who come to treatment for treatment , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and persons with HIV positive partners who were not successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a pedi@@ atri@@ cian , can also register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for supplying medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of Pr@@ EP by using clinical evidence as it is used in a large scale , and is implemented effectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ vens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to contrac@@ eption on HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted at needs and endangered people , the possibility of changing the English HIV epide@@ m@@ ics .
from September to , people with high HIV risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to an negotiating with a partner , which leads to improving many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now as the Pr@@ EP trial has been created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due to the government at the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process .
the evidence show how transforming this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
now it is important that this study is done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that they will help to end the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
the large living live : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designers have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ kers with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; I searched for something that was similar to my prize .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square , large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room estate with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir and a me@@ zz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose they commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; S@@ hed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to make the 12@@ ,5 ft high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a me@@ zz@@ anine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the default .
&quot; the steel is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so they were st@@ acked out without that we had to mosquit@@ oes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with much extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine looks a classic copper set window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
glu@@ ing gold furniture , sil@@ ver@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting put the style for the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it longer work .
in the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance they have mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all cut@@ ters and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space the beauty of living room can close the kitchen when it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a clo@@ ister .
&quot; a bit of engineering work went in , &quot; says Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced M@@ DF @-@ door .
&quot; it is reciproc@@ ally important , so when you push the door , very easily gle@@ aming . &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , one extra bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mental form becomes a real estate ma@@ kler , and can perform a calculation based on the bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the ground surface and use high @-@ quality materials which give the room its luxury advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you do not adore you into the electrical plug in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be characterized by good design and increased square meters of slightly brigh@@ tly into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for an 500 million US dollar imperi@@ um
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in an analysis because of one of the greatest real estate of Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna the brothers own 38 property worth more than half a billion dollars , collected since the family has bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood .
there , the family of West@@ co je@@ ans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail shops .
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in town center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - was described by Paul as a &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul approximately one third .
a court evidence that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property is worth 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proven itself to Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statements proposed by Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court of Justice last Friday .
the brothers also fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to have it out .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but throws Paul before , some domin@@ ions in@@ competent to manage .
in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hope to teach the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides of law firms law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband &apos;s husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk @-@ bars and Del@@ ik@@ at@@ edi@@ atric stores in the late 1950s and acquired a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in the Col@@ in den &apos;s first Je@@ ans@@ ing of the family opened .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property goods to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no more part of De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark on leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars have been paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are so Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has kept very well , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much &quot; because the case before the courts may be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very very sad that my brother Paul decided to shor@@ ten me and drag our family names through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father did not know that Paul and I would like to end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Staff is planning to limit the media &apos;s in@@ contin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it .
if yes , it will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on an equal course .
here is a piece of Reporter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Staff of the White House , on his first working day with leading employees , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he wanted to fix : bad information that fall into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the staff that information about it should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
wa@@ it@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ump Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship with television reaches decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs received , &quot; said the former electoral campa@@ igning Sam Nun@@ berg in February versus Poli@@ tico .
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ umping Twitter &apos;s habit under control , according to six former constitu@@ ent officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ price . &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter habit ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was ridiculous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these camp@@ ag@@ it@@ ators know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ wee@@ ts would have to contain even more ig@@ nition without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the t@@ we@@ et , the tr@@ ump did not send .
if his employees have made it a couple of times , stopping anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevented it that Tr@@ ump chec@@ ver@@ sen calls forth .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , which consists of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump Material , which might promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to lead the president of strategic reasons without doubt .
this was an example that was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react to negative press releases , above all such with damaged le@@ aks , and that it appears to find out where these come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President mal@@ will@@ ingly a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet @-@ pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , which accused the deputy staff of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of sn@@ ic@@ anen permanently from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false pre@@ concep@@ tions in the past and vo@@ ke it .
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Office of Rein@@ ce Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper@@ work and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as pri@@ eb@@ us , but dre@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
me@@ ist@@ ently criminals get postal mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the co @-@ operation of the population will be praying and hoped .
the police sent all over Europe this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards on dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ common core natural according to not known are evidence of the population hoped and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday by the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; calendar of the winter .
the experiences showed that many glimp@@ ses hidden at the holiday destinations , it was by Euro@@ pol .
you have compiled 21 post@@ cards for advanced criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ asis has been reviewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requested could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to notice after the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ th series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are back again with some compens@@ ated travellers on war , which have negotiated one of the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to rec@@ laim a field in front of their men &apos;s houses .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a prosperous road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; million@@ aires series . &quot;
they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were dropped out only in May without being ported by one of the Council grab@@ bing dit@@ ch to prevent their failures .
the tak@@ ingly group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an angry inhabitants told the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous people said , &quot; They were pulled there on the Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they were cast stones on the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact because it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moving forward and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle long transfers to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am living along the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community expensive if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a inhabitants who did not want to be called , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they continue to move on as soon as possible .
to support our prob@@ ation collection , it is very important that as many people call an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation where the court must check when we will present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
out of the former Hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened next March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ ance operating company mbH to the 13th of April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights had been lost per year and also earnings by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in the light of the dramatic numbers of refugees who came across the land district , the hotel buildings were offered as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions for controversial discussions .
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the establishment of an development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not un@@ disputed at that time .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Lie@@ ber@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke already from serious prospective buyers to the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotel with offices located in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ heim object four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s .
you are welcome to Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing at the entrance time for a long period of time before the entrance , and when one enters the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation works are made .
the so@@ ils were torn out , blankets to the part were built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Art Nou@@ veau style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area will be converted , there will be new windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
if one does not want to position themselves at the high level of hotels in foli@@ age @-@ areas , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains the Sch@@ erer .
both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at ease in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism direc@@ tor Michael Kr@@ ause have already led him , so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are just the same with those of the Hotel @-@ Group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment was asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer want to not decide exactly .
just under a million euros , he reck@@ on .
the out@@ systems are also being put on for@@ mann , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open from the restaurant that is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ it@@ ters : us @-@ Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler sets the Grand Jury
in the Russia @-@ monkey by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Mr. Robert Mu@@ eller shall have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Panel has recorded the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper compl@@ ained the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller extended his investigations and intensified .
the CN@@ N channels reported that there are already first pre @-@ lad@@ ders of the body in connection with a meeting between the b@@ umping son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for longer , targeted himself in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there was dis@@ agreements between Tr@@ umps Elec@@ toral team and Moscow .
in the case of investigations , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the re@@ public@@ ans .
repor@@ tedly , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ umps private and business environment among the upe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler Tr@@ ump personally moved into the center and look for the accus@@ ation , whether the president has ham@@ pered the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and determine this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether it should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accus@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mostly they are switched when it is a larger and controversial issue .
the procedure will always be made behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the prosec@@ utor to re@@ charge people to re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N channels , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already issued which revol@@ ve around Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement made in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ umping advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam@@ al@@ ous election leader Paul Man@@ rique during the interview .
right experts said on Thursday night in US television that the installation show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dly in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the setting of the body at the beginning of a new phase was in the studies and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , the president took place on Thursday night a speech in West Virginia to represent Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the subject give the democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in an opinion , he know nothing about the setting of a Grand Jury .
but this work also works usually in the secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House supports all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey have announced three times that not to be established against the President .
you have no reason to accept that something changed by it , it was in the explanation .
however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been frozen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this root , accus@@ ation had become loud against Tr@@ ump , he who want to impe@@ de the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to investigate the investigation against the former national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the Sonder@@ er@@ mitt@@ ler and its employees .
the sol@@ dered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wants to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent occurrence of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller got a position in which he could theoretically be denied by the President of the President of the State Department .
several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow such a step but before .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators set out on Thursday , after which the Special Off@@ ers could no longer be dis@@ missed .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ice@@ berg drives in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved itself from the scar@@ ring height of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
this shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institut for polar and marine research on Wednesday .
the weight of over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers stri@@ ls are now north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted .
it is registered with 175 kilometres in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest in the world &apos;s largest ice , the researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
the degree of climate change has played a role in the demo@@ li@@ tion of the ice@@ berg , is still unclear after research .
in total , however , there have been around 30 years a series of unusual inter@@ bur@@ sts of ic@@ ec@@ es in the region , writes the US research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact .
according to many researchers this could be related to heating .
the now un@@ broken Kol@@ oss has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms out on the sea and is fed by great gl@@ aci@@ ers .
so it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this shot , the balance of wax and abor@@ ting was disturbed in a few years ago .
a complete treasure is there to be dis@@ cour@@ aged , writes AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the pre @-@ established se@@ te have never been withdrawn as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice @-@ plate is under tension and can be sm@@ elled if at a key@@ point a piece is slow@@ down .
the mel@@ ting by Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg does not increase the sea level as it pus@@ hes on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it yields after the mel@@ ting itself .
however , the loss of the che@@ er leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a low degree , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the four @-@ largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it regularly breaks down .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice@@ tag is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most widespread retreat since the start of records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists be disputed that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ i will now grow again or go back in the long term , and possibly tie his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though this researchers didn &apos;t lead the demo@@ li@@ tion of this gigantic ice@@ berg not on climate change , so in recent decades a lot of ice @-@ skating are crum@@ ble in the Antar@@ c@@ tic peninsula .
this long Zi@@ va of the Antar@@ ctic extends in the direction of South America .
according to the data of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has declined since the 1950s by 28 000 square kilometers .
the decline has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ c@@ tic Peninsula have passed around three degrees over the past 50 years and shr@@ ink@@ le to the areas where the temperature is at the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ rigid if personnel
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U is demanding from the Emplo@@ yers Federation to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the Krem@@ lin has been showing 41 new places in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration of M@@ ett@@ mann .
now have 17 apprentic@@ es left their first working day .
the cur@@ riculum in the circle are obviously very popular .
around 6@@ 20 App@@ lications have been available for the surrounding places this year .
nevertheless , the circle is lacking personnel in order to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 different positions at the district M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things physicians and engineers , as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would now be able to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and oppose the lack of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should work out on the wish of the parties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for human resources and human resources development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term needs for specialists , but forward @-@ looking forward @-@ oriented evaluation of the applicants .
the overall concept should be oriented to the inside and outside , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an educational offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier so .
other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ aged from the service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the highest time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes out with his party on the common request .
he was already very long in the cre@@ ek for a lazy surprise when he asked the personnel cost @-@ free public in question and the rest of the parties were stun@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all the opportunities to be reviewed by making an exit from the municipal employer association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are not coming to a satisfying solution at short notice , the administrative management should strive with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - a building @-@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the CD@@ U to pay better to the employees and officials than fores@@ ees the public service to the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases , or more money there is only if you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
however , the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms have had to be set up , in which the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution Protection Act had to be arranged .
last but not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ tor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ated the tone to an NGO @-@ emig@@ rant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has NGOs to use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they may not continue to continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Minn@@ itis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ur@@ iens &apos; , because whose crew had worked together effectively with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation , which has been in operation only since one year , refused to express themselves at extensive pres@@ eas@@ es of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us and remains the salvation of human life our top priority . so we are very sorry to operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are able to assess all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ ur@@ ks &apos; , the Iu@@ v@@ enta , supervised since October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought that his crew runs on board @-@ boat migrants who are delivered directly from human traff@@ ick@@ ers , and that the s@@ mug@@ gl@@ ers can drive , so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least such a coincidence , it was alleged to be only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents of Italian media has been published .
the occupation is suspected , over the authority of the Italian coastal guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not monitored from any other moti@@ fs .
under the Code of Conduct , boats like the Iu@@ v@@ enta have to offer an Italian police officers who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been declared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered un@@ necessarily , but acceptable since they wouldn &apos;t bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti , meanwhile , that the number of migrants had arrived at the rescue operations in Italy in recent weeks , which resulted in the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with the local citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Che@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .

nine We@@ il@@ er@@ mer B@@ iker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and landmarks .
therefore , three liber@@ ated guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ s@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyard of the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
it followed view@@ points , partly on towers , of which one could look far above the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest and the prevalent planes .
in between there were always long periods of asc@@ ents , for the long triumph@@ al .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the popular saus@@ age market .
back to the lookout spot , connected to &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate anus .
on the last two days there were a lot of altitude metres .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers at the open @-@ neutral inhal@@ ation cur@@ able Sole .
also Neu@@ stadt was trendy .
after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 elevation , the group had met the Pf@@ al@@ zer forest from its best side - sporting and culturally .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
sit the sport stars in the future in front of computer consoles , instead of fighting through the wind and weather over the stadium ?
the fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages included .
these have also recognised the first federal ga@@ thers , which are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 made by the V@@ FL Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , the middle of July founded an e @-@ sport department , and two professionals for the computer play FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; we hope to enth@@ use brand new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain that there are still several associations on this move . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the next weekend , the football association organized FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ er compete in various clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven are qualified .
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises on a virtual football @-@ player agency .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old days , that young people will continue to go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the associations tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian , to conquer .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be present more often more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal lig@@ ator to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; with E @-@ Sport , computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or just the soccer simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ ons are established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and with the Asi@@ atic @-@ play , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a real sport ?
for many , the performance is safe .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is wei@@ rd and show a lot of biological and physical responses , which one can also find in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , St@@ res@@ s@@ re@@ reactions , hormonal changes .
in addition , there need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also to exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit@@ ter player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ber also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult at online play , and in the scene , the structures of classical sports .
the scientist highlights the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are on the way internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , over 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , primarily on advertising , sponsor@@ ing , and great tournaments .
sales will be at 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football @-@ Bundesliga , this is a little bit .
however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; international are many countries already further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
large markets are Asia and the US where Ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez take part in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher invested in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ vend@@ or Un@@ ik@@ r@@ n .
also in Europe a lot of things are doing .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as classes , says F@@ rob@@ ber .
in the Netherlands and in France the soccer league associations are now being committed to setting up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in European comparison , Germany explains &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall in nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is no longer sufficient to date .
it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we are living in a digital world , &quot; says Dut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can not stick to that only when football it remains as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Conrad Roy are pushing for su@@ icide , condemned
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls for su@@ icide .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind G@@ it@@ tern and five years were exposed to trial .
Carter was condemned by Conrad Roy in June for the murder of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is unlimited .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until the appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal representatives argue that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a psych@@ ic disease .
dressed in red pants and a cre@@ me@@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with he@@ eded hands and down @-@ looking eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions took Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor committed to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown a re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters said it was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hor@@ rid circum@@ stance which it is totally unfortunate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or irritation or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , the said that there is no day in which I pray not the loss of my beloved Son .
I desire that he is proud of me and how I deal with everything I am trying , despite all my pain we will carry with us for eternity to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it .
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted by the realization , &quot; that she would never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer this only person to have been together with whom I &apos;ve been together since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in me for the rest of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit to others to commit su@@ icide .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy were found dead by a coal @-@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after winning text statements , that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hanging thee , Spring of a building , get you personally , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had been sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All that you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and orda@@ ined that it would benefit through some press by the case .
the case has the legal opinion divided .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x was condemned to her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ am allowed me to run at the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern entrusted to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation vibr@@ ates as not .
something was different at its place in the c@@ ab , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp lam@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made himself dis@@ connected to his arm .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as a Bayern captain .
good , the starter could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign of the Coach could also indicate that .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen in youth games , de@@ pra@@ ising and straight out of the holiday professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he was .
sugar will be distributed at the most ende@@ ar@@ ate to those who you want to have a lot to keep in mood .
who , so , au@@ ser@@ k@@ ers became to enter the heritage of Lah@@ m , can use a small extra @-@ motivation just well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday cool@@ ed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ l@@ ame over the field .
to the right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did its rest .
and at all I seemed to be in this starting line like the one who can take the ruin to the hand even best .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ wa@@ isted tro@@ upe .
he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al thus to over@@ play its missing fitness ( fol@@ dable ) ; Renato San@@ ches to link on the devil , come out to the services of Asia &apos;s journey ( fol@@ dable also only ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le to un@@ locks in their first appearance at Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
this is all well finished .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ ber@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both ag@@ ated sovereign .
the nam@@ e@@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , also tried and tried even in the game building a few times successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy announced that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we had hoped for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; notes , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ used this Bayern World is still available for the new arrivals , one looked after the game .
Ru@@ dy for example was in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber@@ led me following a few cris@@ p statements in the back of his new co @-@ player .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from South America an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Bavaria you just have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .

company content with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ fle@@ dged Minister : economy lo@@ aves Wis@@ mar Tempo
it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) still economic ministries in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year , in which the new economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region are speaking at T V request from a change in economic policy and bl@@ aming the old prime minister .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing understands the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ation of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the pri@@ ori@@ onic list of the country at the top .
in this year the Ministry hopes for a plant@@ ation process until 2021 is supposed to stand the building right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West@@ um@@ ho@@ ist Tri@@ er , which stands in the urgent need for the federal authorities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says the Prime Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann , says the Prime Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .

in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start a new company , pra@@ ises the I@@ HK .

envisaged is a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent exam and 2500 Euro , if graduates are independent within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned street construction , we are quick facts to create , at the same time , out of the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er .

the I@@ HK asks to award more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ presidents , Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations of the billing court , the country invested in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of provincial highways than suggested .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .

Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are faced with a counter@@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW leader said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the business as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of engines of diesel vehicles to install , take also what it makes difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful autoimmune companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation units , which could regulate emissions when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were accused of Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
the former director of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany last month .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation at Volkswagen , after the authorities use Audi to have a system installed to deal with the emission rules in Europe and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the involvement of Audi in the investigation could be difficult to charge Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes significantly to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ us@@ asen and the laughter of suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was temporarily one of the most published carto@@ on carto@@ ons , the inf@@ oll@@ us@@ hes of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 stands the Argent@@ inian and works in a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested himself as a dra@@ fts@@ man for lucky cards , which was frustrated by him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded at the end of the six@@ ties : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist of cities are inspired .

la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to the rec@@ alling conditions of dro@@ ught reminded conditions and due to the disease @-@ related insects declined , leading scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ ache .
Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agri@@ business institutions of CR@@ I@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed because the plant was exposed to climate change the effects of climate change in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has an effect on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small fence , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , transm@@ its the d@@ warf @-@ cades , and with very dry weather there is very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the black@@ out of the ground , but also the test of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dry .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the Thr@@ ac@@ ian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meet on Wednesday afternoon to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars .
but that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss , which feels safer : they should take their children to the office which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table in the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .
you ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ en range .
there are drugs sch@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspic@@ ious to stand on the pay@@ roll of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are frequent . at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to died in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under attack and threats under Bundes@@ schutz und until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year .
among the latter , their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and being journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs .
its absence is perceived deeply though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its middle @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the façade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porter in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss about their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , ins@@ om@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ wal@@ ker was established in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings .
as with most thousands of murder , which are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ oc@@ ated and although the terrain is now still tra@@ itor .
without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May , Val@@ dez abandoned the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital city of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ter River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ hal@@ a has become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as the rival@@ ry fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of enchanted , two @-@ story mau@@ sole@@ es for drug could , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; when only a Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs in the United States .
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understandings have contributed to the murder .
in February the release of a interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons .
this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ members bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second error was to force Val@@ dez not to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined forces with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the smoke issue , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said .
at the time the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it to publish hard plac@@ eable examinations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever they lead .
he gave volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take on the task that inf@@ ects you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the light of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a port worker , the friend , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice strikes , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table .
now ask her : was his love of routine be his grave ?
his death also forced her to question her own assumptions on how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their in@@ ward run@@ way and run@@ ways in order to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even at the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells , stay away from it .
the trouble is , said the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing is happening with Javier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside there were two polic@@ emen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a vi@@ cious building in a mid @-@ class neighbourhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the Scher@@ z , some of the repor@@ ters asked , whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who were the governor themselves as not trustworthy .
it is months ago since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug poli@@ ties are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has made three main stories .
there was the murder of the brother of the former known bo@@ xing Julio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state , which focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the Pro@@ secution , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it came to pass , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities .
a re@@ porter from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who belongs to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the whole century all the political planes .
recently , several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of corruption because of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military accident .
only a few months ago the reader would have viewed the Kolum@@ ba by Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we already knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that are opposed to the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press .
reunion Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is his one .
throughout the country journalists have become sound@@ less by being written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on pav@@ ement and buildings .
on this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to sp@@ y journalists and let them reverse because they said the truth .
she has then asked that she is once again divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has hurt their objectiv@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico of organised crime to participate in government officials and a consistent society &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters not only be killed by drug bonds , but also on the command of politicians and security guards the organised crime under a ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the media group &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , you live because they want you to sne@@ ak the mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Mary Elizabeth Mac@@ ias in the northern border @-@ state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer equipment and ear@@ phones next to their separated head .
some branches have elected to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua , following the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how El Man@@ ana was done by Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug carrier with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the streets and looking for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay back and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ome decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra who once wanted to be po@@ ets is there that drug trafficking was scar@@ ed him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I was re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
around midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors were sitting at the side@@ walk from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on the side@@ walk in front of the office and tran@@ sit@@ ing beer , than once all their tele@@ phones began .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ rival and security guards in the vicinity of the bath@@ house Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed t@@ ote .
the war continues as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the cur@@ rant background , they have released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about mobile phones .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ es he@@ el in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they showed it not .
under the vast portrait of the unusual founder of the newspaper , whose mid@@ finger was visible to the very sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you also only commemor@@ ate it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day was murdered by Javier , the traine@@ e asked me to send it to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used to avoid its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , if a terri@@ fying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nas@@ horn of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ osau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his g@@ lowing skin of Roman Braun was - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; un@@ troubled past . &quot;
the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Biology &quot; called him as &quot; the possessed of a pan@@ elled dinosau@@ rs , who was ever found , and one of the best Din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ cop@@ es , who lived in the middle of chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well preserved state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Geographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved Fossi@@ l of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , den den .
he met something that was missing from the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ja , and decided to see more accurately .
that was discovered by him Fossi@@ l was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy mort@@ als .
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little with the eyes flas@@ hing , you could almost believe it , &quot; said the captain Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will enter into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved Din@@ osau@@ rs specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa , the dinosau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this plant @-@ e@@ ater is covered , although it is covered with an arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably threatened by meat @-@ made dinosau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a sh@@ iel@@ ding technology that is known as a counter @-@ coated , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , saying experts , which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ cop@@ es took head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marked with the Museum engineers Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of sho@@ cks and arm@@ aments over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sha@@ ded , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sha@@ ded is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals alive today .
it indicates that the dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution has fav@@ oured the deterior@@ ating of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals , which use the counter @-@ sha@@ ding - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or gir@@ ths - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ cop@@ ite was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ tier behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs @-@ rob@@ bery of chal@@ k @-@ time must have been , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosau@@ r was brown .
scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including its con@@ ser@@ ous Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the dinosau@@ r , when he died , came into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea .
at that time Alberta was as warm as south fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far more widespread than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ cop@@ es is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k period was a time , as huge Ther@@ opo@@ ei@@ ves , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ r , who stood on two legs , the earth was per@@ ched .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of its frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes Acro@@ can@@ th@@ hei@@ rus , an 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta after the death in the sea sun@@ k and destroyed in mud .
the creature was found funk by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine in the vicinity of Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , den den .
according to the museum , it is the populated dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch l@@ aces that ra@@ ven from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was damaged by the Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .
but the Under@@ cover of the dinosau@@ r has kept its arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy cor@@ ds along the dinosau@@ r
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a profit in the lottery .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ te of the skin still cover the hol@@ pri@@ mor@@ ed fla@@ vor@@ ed plates that carry the sk@@ ull of the beast .
his right for@@ rests lies on his side , his five fingers are rus@@ hed to the top .
I can count the shoes on his sole count . &quot;
in thunder@@ storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday night at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilometres long steel - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon approximately 20 people had been violated .
after the first data of the police , Adel@@ z@@ hausen und O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ scape A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were at almost 30 vehicles during a thunder@@ storm under 30 cars , including trucks .
the exact number of the last documents had no information before .
it is about light to medium @-@ sized injuries , said a poli@@ cem@@ an .
a large listing of rescue vehicles was at the accident .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , there was a couple of ten kilometres long @-@ rep@@ ent@@ au .
like a AZ @-@ re@@ porter , it also came on the counter@@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ brig@@ ade noted the symbols of the vehicle plane , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was another accident at A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car otran@@ smit@@ ters and a car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tes@@ ters &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing else is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ gen@@ ious thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an impro@@ per or tear the road in the middle of the workflow .
driver &apos;s check .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tes@@ ters the job@@ less driver control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone , that it is taken to its place and is therefore used to control the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then expected to be available in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a subway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is called the train run free of charge without work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use this , however , you need to meet some requirements : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you must have booked an online ticket - which is anyway the most passengers do .
you also need to have bought it via the App of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of the ticket .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works so : one gets to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the test customers a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the train companion get on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X has been in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
arrives the train companion in the bike control at number Y he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already de@@ valu@@ ated online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep on silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which again should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is relaxed without ticket control through our train service , check out in the DB Navigator just yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train of personal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing @-@ Board of DB correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often drives track , knows that besides delays and missed the lanes controls are among the largest sle@@ ep@@ ages .
because often one does not have any documents in any case , but one of the fellow travelers don &apos;t need any documents that are needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the resource ID is missing or otherwise a document that you need to pre@@ dict .
the result is endless discussions between Zug@@ companion and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the part or large @-@ room and delays in controlling your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end takes time to worry about other matters .
still only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further immigration on the same track are not released yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to her core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis , born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ wil@@ dered , because no one else had posted the information on her Fe@@ ed , she completed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly re@@ generated on their tim@@ eline .
the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officers in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live .
he po@@ kes a picture of Brow@@ ns le@@ blo@@ ous bodies that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thought Fer@@ rell at itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to t@@ we@@ et about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos from the police band and people , the crying , and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live fairy in which a poli@@ cem@@ an was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bell@@ ous dog .
in another video , she said , escaped another poli@@ cem@@ an and shou@@ ted : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did Fer@@ rell reminded of her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder , that we have used to ourselves and which we can call it typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt bulk soli@@ ds .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return trip and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 p.m. , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive the next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinemas from the 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , the strength and resistance of resistance , which is from the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers .
as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , carried a flo@@ wer@@ dress and a suitable crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could not take them , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later .
&quot; what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves .
even though I have the fortune to give her an experience in which she personally knew no obj@@ ection@@ able racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station , when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business@@ man who made lunch .
they prepared hand@@ bags before and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to accept for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rell arrived during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted only to document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was fed by countless cases of people , often from White - in a community that benefited from her pain and their resistance ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like Fol@@ ay@@ an recently explained in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and grew up , their voices are not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had worked together with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area , which is known for his activ@@ ism around to@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt Ins@@ assen .
his commitment brought him closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; during the years to Brow@@ ns .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . we talk , &quot; Davis said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented , as I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos;s experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprising personal aspect of Ferr@@ ells life , as she married and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability at this work and the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos;s story repeated the role of the black gay women in the broader black @-@ lives @-@ mattress movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ magic Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as s@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly struggling from different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it ins@@ ists that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Fer@@ rell was chosen as heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it is no coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake .
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long gone , but the racial connections between the community and the police have continued to continue .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years due to the block@@ ade of a highway on a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area they called her home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
nevertheless , they cling to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built long ago .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the South of the pedestrian prec@@ inct was spl@@ its since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
on our Facebook @-@ Page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic will be discussed .
while the one to say @-@ Galerie say , &quot; that would be a dream ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no human being &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or simply plain : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , of which the rest of the business will benefit , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct .
added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is available , in which 13 direct marketed their products .
with the beginning of construction work there will be an end .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed with a possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost every week in the peasant market for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farm are always happy again .
even the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we have discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether direct marketed in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ um@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary .
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many charging stations are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a neat weekly market , it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall .
because after all , the goods delivered there is made fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is ob@@ end@@ ly inexpensive .
as you can see will store Lad@@ in shops in a shopping centre just by major companies , as the dor@@ man@@ t are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , specialty shops there is almost no more and that which is still remaining , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a mall with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ Galerie is actually coming .
or does it already create the spec@@ ter bit @-@ gallery before , to exp@@ el all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply will not work .
and a Shopping Center , which stands empty also nobody needs .
in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a peasant market hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no place anymore .
when the peasant market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that hung on cab@@ ling from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ ppers and Haar@@ ions , which you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ zer consisted a 35 @-@ year @-@ old sentence , after having established diplomatic news about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ come resem@@ b@@ lance ( A suitable similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman , and pioneering dis@@ associates whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted through the algorithms for DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as anyone could look with this genom@@ ic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ent determin@@ ant of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoke openly about the identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty was sentenced in 2013 by 20 votes against the sp@@ y law , computer pol@@ l and theft .
through the prison their picture was suppres@@ sed , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ tic , black @-@ white bl@@ f@@ ie , in the cre@@ ing clearly sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ former per@@ gap - associated with it .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project . &quot;
in it , the artist &apos;s portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cig@@ ar and che@@ wing g@@ um , extracted the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; she conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press show of the new exhibition .
and she was not visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you had contact with Chelsea , and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her de@@ tain@@ ted M@@ use were un@@ equal to un@@ equal letters , which in the course of two years are inter@@ changeable .
they created even one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ res@@ sed Images , &quot; who would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Ch@@ ot@@ as would transform judgment and would be capable to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was in fact just a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release would demand for seven brutal years in a military event in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy coincidence .
there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something woo@@ fer and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , t@@ we@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions which he actually should fix .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery written by the gallery , Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature , including ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , by incorpor@@ ating the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ tide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) to show how amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring to it is that our genome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ ur@@ ious Mem@@ ories , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , that &apos;s why the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition which is stored in a separate room is a page from the above com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a Fre@@ is@@ pre@@ ele@@ phone in the hand from the discipline of discipl@@ eship of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they address your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted with Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ ese , if I &apos;m talking about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it should be anticipated in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ulators that collap@@ sed as hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ists were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to be like a mass movement which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford due to killing
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which were sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ self ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ t because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , showing how the acts of the Cook County demonstrate .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died .
one of the police authority of Chicago releases common War@@ n@@ system states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the place of action for dead , and dete@@ ctive examine the stit@@ ches as a murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them@@ atic has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ed , Vice Chairman of the University of Berlin , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ ws now be in the absence of abroad and be excluded from the ban on the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue that examines the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates at this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help U.S. investigation authorities in any way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and wanting he himself .
Chief Communications Officer at the Police of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police have a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the time axis and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian chan@@ cell@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian deputy re@@ mi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap has been updated in this respect , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada on compliance with code which describes the criteria for re @-@ setting of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything that could cause a concern for Russia .
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented .
and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list however states that Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities must accept the reported results of by the W@@ ada Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren by the Canadian lawyer , Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accept dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; we are leading the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has gotten a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ual words voted with those of Vital@@ y S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
talking to the Russian outlets at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added S@@ mir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als of W@@ ada on the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after a visit to the main event of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moved in the right direction , to be used again .

&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used by companies to measure employees involvement .
patho@@ tt said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel with G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys from certain teams , it offers an heat map of the company , which shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers can have low approval results - so that you can drill up why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture you have to stay , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who published in Sk@@ and@@ ale since a former employee has published a blog post who describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken .
the desire for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t is this wish for an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance @-@ sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , according to the budget@@ ary website Let &apos;s talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to avoid bad behavior and recognize , seeing an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber had recently been registered as a client .
how G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ters can send customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and watch the heat @-@ maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report a bad behavior .
and if the chief business leader is involved , complaints should go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or in@@ ethical , it can experience precious consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers flu@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and mo@@ tions , said Quin@@ lan .
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or email for the company headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a inti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints from employees .
now , since the company Conver@@ cent to use , can problems that were previously identified by executives , who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ loud practitioners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree point of view in the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , which heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment and li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employees commitment in 2002 , after the accounting @-@ company Arthur Andersen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to their right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people use hope as a strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sap@@ phire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ ist@@ ern secured $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are barely surprising , given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more of their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stakes .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel in a company that is worth their voices , and that the work that you are doing is worthwhile to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , which is used both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t .
investors can reach Ren@@ der if their portfolio companies are well running . companies will run well if employees are working and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on the employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrator of a company does not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation , that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these dis@@ appointments can be brought forth , and set up demo@@ ti@@ ts .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow people ask themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and if you do not worry about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Reed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly associate surveys , was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Deli@@ ver .
and after collecting feedback from frustrated staff , she was able to organize through the speed of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and add a communications training to tackle the problems .
with Ruby Tuesday , the company will always receive new insights on the staff , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better relationship of workers in a sector which is known for high revenues .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A footprint is on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have put out their tri@@ cot@@ ters and show the backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses are returning after the three @-@ hour practice to check their final check before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man football center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was closed .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood at the beginning of the camp was moved almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood exercises .
they should hold out over the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he support the control modification of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add a further point in the multiple itiner@@ aries of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we place this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it up , they plac@@ ken further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the Camp finished , what has been thrown in view of the clear blue line of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that is already lit with pedest@@ rians , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ bell , no easy task .
brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there might be a problem as soon as those rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adjust it to record an exercise .
if you have the Vide@@ ob@@ and of a exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
so I am not too worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts @-@ review in the fight against counterfe@@ it news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fal@@ cons at Fak@@ ten@@ audi@@ tor of third parties and then show their results under the original contribution then , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine vision methods to detect possible counterfe@@ it messages and to send it to the fact @-@ audi@@ tor that may display results from the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main contribut@@ ors for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of whom believe they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue , whereby the French voters were flooded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany should be pun@@ ished a plan where social media networks are supposed to be pun@@ ished , even if they fail to eliminate h@@ asser@@ ting post@@ ings as before the elections in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told Facebook in a separate statement in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched .
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories are challenged by fact , the people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook @-@ News in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to his news feeds to reduce false messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he @-@ years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of its cosy sitting in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so nice to look for the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says we@@ d@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Bec@@ ky Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , &quot; a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emo@@ tionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only responded to the thum@@ b pressures on the side of a letter , who was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ he years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
and letters craw@@ ling always to smoke , because at that time , they were called a fire because of light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself .
Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
for someone who is so struck with old papers that he was assisted by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( &quot; To be honest : I have assessed my welcome greeting to be a little over@@ rated , &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and cur@@ i@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ ed hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles which had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he emig@@ rated by the grounds and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke with Land@@ scap@@ es , ten@@ derness and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust won first in 2006 as the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes hit a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years in which Ar@@ isto@@ cr@@ ates said &quot; Oh , wh@@ f it described on the attic . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , cards who possessed what had said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could think that landing conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guys , let everything go his course ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on bre@@ wing base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm up of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ ver who appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book called &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly , of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farmer stood in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the story of the Jesu@@ it &apos;s family during the English Reformation seven years .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rell presented from the 18th century , filled his own funer@@ al by filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was only later years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be cro@@ ok , getting back debts and spend money for things that they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell men prov@@ oked their debt crisis by un@@ married old women - I imagine it as a bunch of hand@@ some guys before , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for another unique writing experiences
he has taken a two weeks stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ paraly@@ män@@ ma@@ ki , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ oll dating back to the early 20th century , which since then returned from nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the closing of the 30@@ 1 year old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Honnef on Friday started their campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
still until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to hold the logo and the slogan secret to Nelson Ar@@ tz .
at the end of August it was a highlight of the campaign to give a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write it on their yesterday &apos;s own website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
basically , we are the firm belief that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
in the action it is more than just a logo and a slogan , it says further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a common promise to form@@ ulate one that gives the city a distinctive feature of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
the city will cost the town of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdogan &apos;s scar@@ fs fear of the army
each year in early August advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ations and subsidies in the officer &apos; officer .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine of the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
in the meetings , under the presidency of the Government now also took the five Vice President , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers .
the civilians in the Y@@ as were in excess .
the government moves the bree@@ der in the military .
Chief Apostle Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were deduc@@ ted .
since the failed cou@@ p , Chief 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als has fired .
about 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdogan as a dragon war .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the put@@ sch test , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divine gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really in control of the army ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns for an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifes@@ ts among other things in the abolition of the headaches for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the big clean@@ se in the army and security guards continues .
in the middle of July , Erdogan by decree was further 73@@ 95 citizenship , including 2@@ 303 police officers and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
at the same time , Erdogan seemed to be t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als former earlier than the actual lords of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardian of the world &apos;s state .
after his election victory , Erdogan advoc@@ ated the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform of the European Union .
former officers say Erdogan &apos;s targe@@ ting a Islam@@ ization of the Armed Forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; notably not so @-@ called officer , who looked for asylum in fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development might not be cold .
anyway , in the alliance for pur@@ ges , there is doubt that the Turkish army had doubts about the use of Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and oper@@ ation@@ ary skills should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he sees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year to reduce stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary residence permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do so by the US to change the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
this new application procedure will get the candidate who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that are coming to our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American Media .
ministry wants to re@@ construct a track for racing
over the past few months , over the past few months , over the future of the race of the race had been denied - and now it should go very quickly .
even before the end of the year , at the nav@@ y track , there is to be built on which the tourist track is to be built .
in order to secure the future of the racing country in the long term , according to the traffic Ministry , the traffic Department will begin to start the track later this year .
&quot; with the decision to order and san@@ ship the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is known especially for the tourism important connection , &quot; declared road secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l am Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of the repair of the route is about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum the country take 75 percent .
the contract , based on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country , will definitely be coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ deutsche ür@@ ingen Bahn as operators are already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the roadmap , the vehicles and the quality standards are held , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the racing stei@@ g shuttle will be ordered on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , the track has been tested in the course of a pilot company , whether the course is used by plenty of people to order them in the future .
the track is also in parts very low .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it could not yet be crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ous professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking their ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eyel@@ ash of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Shar@@ key said with the release of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ els have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by the artificial intelligence .
the user can also custom@@ ize his robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eyel@@ id of the robot to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it will be more disturbing , since many robots have the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would let a Ste@@ p@@ ford woman would be progressive .
modern s@@ exp@@ els have developed to robots with a silicon skin .
the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that find them appealing like fi@@ del@@ ity .
and then there are the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robots with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of relap@@ se and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Sle@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .
in the course of the day she has also her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , fix@@ ated on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ tak@@ ingly female properties , the play@@ back on rape , if you go a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is here : reluc@@ tance ) Far@@ rah , be@@ wil@@ fully a most .
on his website true True P@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why do men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website .
however these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish , or just another sex toy .
their formation and their growing sophistic@@ ation indicate something darker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not keep having sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their increasing popularity , they remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture .
but what le@@ ak@@ oo@@ ed out of the edge @-@ zones may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or abu@@ sive until they gave them the free market for them .
there is however a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House , who gave it pra@@ yer@@ ful to have women sexually attacked .
the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images , the mu@@ ddy bodies and the selected eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
their builders want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that may hin@@ der on independence or anything , which could interfere with the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
Tr@@ umps big Performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney as the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy man .
it has become a bin@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess of the Tr@@ ump era that the political divisions , which polar@@ ized the US voters , even families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Harvest dan@@ k@@ fest , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump &apos;s relatives .
we are all supposedly pack@@ aged to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , families to bring together .
I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and for a long time engaged with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with which she fought for ten @-@ ten years because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side .
to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another context that this will also bring considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ closing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we speak of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and dump , we refer to the gr@@ assy opportunity to not rep@@ el us any longer any day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is yet another long @-@ long @-@ long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of denial .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the accident - the dog on the car tax , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return saw ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact occur as a mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as im@@ meas@@ ur@@ ably improvement .
when my c@@ ousin in the city was , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ et@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the Fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals ver@@ rot@@ ate to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
twenty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite happy about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange experience , since here two two year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women can go to it and all have a great time .
if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel I would have given it the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I took my credit card .
in the coffee house on the corner of my street it &apos;s the same thing , plus the option , the rating with a 15 % ti@@ pping to the same - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ prehen@@ sive , while I tired the experience made to reach my credit card with five stars .
Oscar pist@@ ori@@ us with ni@@ ache from prison to hospital moved
Pist@@ ori@@ us was the second time left the prison for hosp@@ it@@ homes .
last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wr@@ ists , which he suffered the prison guards upon a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of a call for the prosec@@ ut@@ ors of the prosec@@ utor &apos;s prosec@@ ut@@ ors , due to a appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he k@@ ills Ste@@ en@@ kamp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , taking it several times through a door of the toi@@ let@@ ins in his house in Pre@@ toria .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der that was hidden in the c@@ ab .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year @-@ old sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal to which they say they are too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national prosec@@ utor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that they will be registered with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools the four @-@ cl@@ and@@ ler schools were dischar@@ ged from F@@ itt@@ en@@ hofen to the holidays and the continuing schools .
three of the det@@ achment go out in the future of the gram@@ mar school , four at the Real@@ schule .
Schul@@ le@@ aning Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol for the school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eagle , who is up in the chicken court , but then released into the freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken hof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it out of his chicken .
instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out .
but the hope to make out of him a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out on a high mountain its wings and escaped .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the training of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dancing .
the hens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet .
the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ le@@ st Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young man is different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to it .
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
you wish every four @-@ cl@@ and@@ ler that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed the word @-@ word to the colleagues , the former school@@ er Michael Müller , who inv@@ aded over and over again with sub@@ contractor , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the kitchen time is now over , the class teacher , Sophia Schu@@ macher .
they leave their students after two years of teaching just very odd , because it had been a really great time .
finally they can rely on the quadru@@ pe@@ ers .
on the conclusion , all students got a song of summer time and holiday season .
there was great joy in the children .
for the new school year , eight are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were de@@ tained in Greece because of illegal camps , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited by television .
on the morning of August 1 , Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by police in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while currently an examination is running .
the State Department reported b@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free Camp@@ s and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , substantial funds .

software update for diesel cars : what the persons affected now need to know
how exactly is the software update ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in action ?
the most important questions and answers in the overview .
in the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars offered .
they should improve the gas behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europa are estim@@ ations :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
its retro@@ fit has arranged the power station @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a breeding implementation in the next few months , but have not yet been given an exact date .
Daimler has communicated to write every person affected .
if anyway an inspection is due , it will be done in its framework .
how long should the retro@@ fit apply altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
it depends on the engagement of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , volunte@@ ering act on the subject environment so far not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming may be to get an appointment .
what do drivers do , which do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW company ?
the ACE was@@ p to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would withdraw , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
does now a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions , where driving b@@ b@@ inger dro@@ us .
in rural areas there has so far been no losses for older diesel .
the ACE advises to wait with a sale yet .

the award @-@ winning film series with progressive TV @-@ series announced that it is already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish the participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old E@@ ste@@ fan stressed , she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump in order to clarify her view .

we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes next year in R@@ ente .
the passage is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work always makes it great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press conversation .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks which are waiting for his successor .
at the same time , I wondered that so far no application will fulfill the demands .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineering at the end of time .
thus , taking into consideration the regular notice of cancellation - still enough time for a review .
since Has@@ lach was ens@@ ed for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant has to pre@@ dict appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot fill them out this way , the citizens would have to go to advisory services up to Off@@ enburg .
but the proximity of the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who reports on a good working environment as well as good mood between the authority and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some important projects have gathered to look back to the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city li@@ vable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park@@ platz is about to be settled .
the Kin@@ zig@@ bridge between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach will be renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates .
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
design is available for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister of great room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own bau@@ l@@ hof and ten@@ derness , it could be quite flexible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands as an ensemble , under monuments , it is important to have an eye for what rein@@ suits , &quot; if new builds are approved , the pus@@ hes Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
anyway the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility .
he is a prot@@ ector , &quot; in the end everything is going through my table . &quot;
in case of support and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
who wants to do Roland W@@ acker , according to information of the city of Has@@ lach , should be able to pre@@ dict a diploma or Bachelor &apos;s degree as a diploma and Bachelor &apos;s degree in the fields of construction and building plann@@ ers .
the municipal office under@@ stands high@@ - and low @-@ construction , construction planning , administration of urban parks , urban farm building with builders and municipal ten@@ derness as well as sub@@ contracting bodies , including mind protection .
bicycle on lines threw : southwest track closed
according to police , the blue bike had thrown the blue bike from the railway @-@ crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged so strongly that the her@@ ann@@ ed freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go from two male perpetrators and look for the night time after them .
close to the place of witnesses were a ros@@ ary Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike @-@ driver has been observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have brought itself in great danger and is also endangered by rail traffic .
apart from the damage to the Lo@@ k and the facility as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport , we could also use pole of rail customers to the cul@@ pr@@ its .
overall , be accompanied by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , said the spokes@@ man .
the damage was rec@@ tified on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ track could be guided without disabilities .
nearly 10 persons are Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains were not falling out , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres high @-@ lines .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ iling )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
but a new study claims to the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causing stomach cr@@ amps and flat@@ ul@@ ations , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
during those affected usually , meat and dairy products are normally en@@ vy to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University came out that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to make sure that damaging micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the body not to penetrate into the body .
cells , which are capable of eradic@@ ating inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the body .
when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ iling .
in experim@@ entation has been found that a kind of tolerance conve@@ ying immune cell was found in mice causing a specific bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the components of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a link between a bacterial art - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet is tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel , if the same system is also wh@@ irl@@ pools .
the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of academic powers had such cells , but another group of the same tribe who had not been separated , this did not .
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ds of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
the D@@ är@@ ts of the mice were found DNA sequ@@ ential and were found six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without it in the mice .
mice were raised in a ster@@ ile environment , so they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria out on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i could grow in a fluid and over@@ led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells that have been ins@@ ulated by the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
as the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ aboli@@ c that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ov were hal@@ ved , the number of cells declined by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i to protect us in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ subsidiary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i developed the cells in people as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pounds Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before starting at the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressive in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to popular .
however , MAT@@ IC was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve at the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four to get , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier when they get four of four , but they have given great difficulty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar sh@@ ields , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .

new deep strike for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind still turns : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still the SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Minister before elections has always been with a certain concern to Berlin .
merely no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no counter @-@ wind from the Bund - so was the most important wish of the campaign fighters .
since Martin Schulz , the Party has radically changed .
since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt @-@ House observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach .
there were pl@@ ains .
and indeed one after the other .
the covenant @-@ CD@@ U look after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the editors of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
the surprising fac@@ tional resolution of a Green Party has over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the election election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the Opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ leader Michael wa@@ iters prompted the ab@@ ou@@ tw@@ ined low @-@ Sax@@ on green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ ander@@ ed to return their mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transi@@ tions to the CD@@ U means a clear rejection of the elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ke T@@ ander@@ ing must immediately withdraw its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Chancellor and Elec@@ tions of the Green Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may not all be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sigh@@ ing an SPD election fighter , as on Friday morning the new hi@@ de@@ bot@@ t@@ lement reached the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan W@@ eil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the crossing of green parliament@@ arians to the CD@@ U without its own government majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the provisional culmin@@ ation of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and no one knows what comes next .
the offen@@ se began with the unexpected clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , more does not , cal@@ ms down the comrades of his time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia everything will be different .
this was then too - and everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the party goes smoothly .
lab@@ orious r@@ apping the comrades in the weeks later again .
then when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him the next shock came .
Mayor O@@ laf Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD state , lost its Nim@@ bus because he was sitting in El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while he burned his city .
and because he was doing pretty much wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z is fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
because of the VW @-@ exhau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the low @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese transformations were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just that , W@@ eil tried to put stronger in the federal government in the past weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they left him , as they for@@ bi@@ ds a stabil@@ isation of the party in W@@ eil .
now the exact opposite could arise .
in doing so , we@@ dge in the party @-@ internal constraints , the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens are in essence no guilt .
and Schulz did not stand at all .
meanwhile , the comrades try to hold its own ranks .
their anger focuses on the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the secluded parliament@@ ar@@ ier@@ ine in T@@ jac@@ kets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , like Ms T@@ jac@@ kets have their own career experiences regarding the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Head of the Par@@ tic@@ ham in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Tic@@ ino is not chosen because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the country list of the lower @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens , so the Lower @-@ Sax@@ on MP continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that their mandate returns .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , laments a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ v@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD as a leading edge candidate in the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the personal career thinking of a future CD@@ U MEPs are fal@@ si@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called on to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there were further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for the outskirts III
those who wants to be swe@@ pt in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative Ste@@ g city development took place on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave once again a review of the past events .
since 1991 it has been in delicate refurbis@@ hment areas .
at that time , in the San@@ itation I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the San@@ re@@ ation area II from 2005 to 2016 the grant was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing refurbis@@ hments are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote internal development and not only tap new construction areas .
on April 4 I received the information given by the Government of Karlsruhe on April 4 that there will be a re@@ organisation III .
the funding tot@@ alling 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which there were 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the community .
how is a re@@ organisation now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will continue to examine so Sh@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also play a role whether in the planned area they are interested in harmony .
if necessary , the district limits could also be moved again .
the jet@@ ty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pie@@ tz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cellar presented the contents of the federal states program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which they would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ ization of indoor cities , improving living and working conditions and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is to be performed per property .
the re@@ organisation would eventually finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the pay@@ back period for funding has been going on since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , it would only once again be conducted with the inventory , as part of those who will get a questionnaire to filling out a questionnaire .
in November or December , the Stat@@ utes should be carried out as possible , so that in the coming year with the refurbis@@ hments can be started .
Pie@@ tz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently explained that any Commun@@ e must carry out the said preliminary investigation .
it is the reason to evaluate and decide the urban development of the city , and decide when it is sanc@@ tioned and to what extent .
for the respective property there will be also a refurbis@@ hment note in the property manual .
Pie@@ tz@@ sch@@ mann will come back again and make a picture of the situation , she spoke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires who will be sent to citizens over the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and back@@ bone &quot; in which it is related to the construction state and the re@@ organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oper@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to fill in , if in the building business rooms are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is aware that Got@@ zel definitely pointed out that a filling out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
furthermore , new measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ able .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; wind &quot; principle - who first comes , ma@@ zes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot reserve the funding fee for later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refurbis@@ hment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor sets itself a micro@@ chip in order to come up with a hand@@ craft in house and car
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip so he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even start with a hand@@ craft his car .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory assistant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , joined to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built up both at home and for his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the expenses of the White House costs the tax@@ payers thousands
the decision of the White House , a marine helicop@@ ters to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights the American production last month , costs tax payers to the members of the military that have been left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American building programmes .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ fts from Mississippi .
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an fragile order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ters at the South La@@ wn landed , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter took place on 17 July at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained so long until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of service hours a second team would be needed for the flight back .
the original flight was found during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the floor at the plane .
the records made of the records were not clear if ultimately a second flight was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides state @-@ owned , state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event the president gave an impetus for the reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ andi@@ sts the efforts of con@@ tainment of government rules .
using the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon in politically advantageous purposes .
President are obligated to use them for the journey .
however , to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February as the presidential aircraft against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that are compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products made from all 50 countries , which are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 Parti@@ cip@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn through to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G20 in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was in the White House of 58 exercise programmes .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event was involved in the training needs of the flight rates for the month , said an official .
Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours this day for non @-@ presidential missions .
the White House said that the tax@@ payers have taken the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man by Sik@@ or@@ sky said the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no budget records for the presidential election , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ent@@ ari@@ ons of the US Ministry of Ministry for fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ Kit for the v@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour &apos;s drive .
chron@@ icle of the unit dates the flight time of the flight as 30 minutes from the home base of the Navy Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ payers are to be set on the basis of the estimates for non @-@ refundable rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs involved in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the resolutions for DO@@ D do not contain human resources costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract .
at this time the former prestige of the White House , Sean Sp@@ eck , the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ reads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the Federal State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight the highlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour across the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the cock@@ pit of a fire@@ wall .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Sik@@ or@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
top @-@ rated of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundesliga to the Tab@@ le@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weis@@ s Ne@@ uss will go to S@@ V in Kiel tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel .
despite following five games still a flaw@@ less balance sheet , the leader of the Second Tennis @-@ Bundesliga have received the sense of reality .
team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability in the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V ensure the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ itting and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ erre@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; this will be as difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e jan@@ four .
at the moment the Chall@@ enger @-@ tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not create the Bundesliga . at the tournament in the Czech Li@@ bere@@ c spiel@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , it comes to its first use in this season .
the previously un@@ defeated ch@@ il@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ ans An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski even at the ATP @-@ tournament in K@@ itz@@ bü@@ hel at the ball .
he should be in Kiel but also as Bo@@ tic Van de Z@@ and@@ ol@@ p , N@@ iels Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both The Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could go back into the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , which was in January 2016 the number one of the j@@ uni@@ ors Wel@@ tran@@ g@@ ist , not , anyone filling out from the coach to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he put his signature under the law of intensi@@ fication of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his H@@ ast , the law to en@@ acted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pack@@ aged Congress a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional rules &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed against the US advancement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , the draft will look ahead to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians to build G@@ asp@@ ip@@ elines in the EU .
since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV are involved in co @-@ financed with other European companies the construction of the Russian Ost@@ ro@@ ver@@ ung Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is violent .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil corporation .
actually , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring sanctions to life even by executive order .
twelve weapons are available to him in this respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really we@@ do him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ co@@ Staff@@ el 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Car@@ tel is in the center of the Hit@@ ti@@ x Hit@@ ti@@ x .
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer revealed , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is still far from being over .
the season three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest em@@ aker of the show .
with the third season the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful P@@ ates , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 companies &quot; only with more state existence and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) , the Mexican connection , and Che@@ pe Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal is returning to Javier Pe@@ ña , the type , the American and Colom@@ bian criminal authorities to support the war on drugs .

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen staff
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ Mittag@@ table again .
with strong contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the clock will be revers@@ ed in the urban children &apos;s day .
as of September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will be taking over the town of Es@@ sens@@ orial in the urban children &apos;s day facilities ( Kit@@ ts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance , deputy leader in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he continues to be cooked except for house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh cool@@ ed .
the city runs in the circle area 46 children &apos;s day@@ care centres , in 44 get children at lun@@ ch@@ time a warm meal .
in the last Kit@@ a@@ year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 weekly hours are looked after , in the cas@@ ita to mid@@ day , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 p.m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 sub @-@ time professionals have from the 1st September kitchen service : you warm the angel@@ ed meals , add them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , rooms off , rin@@ se and clean@@ se the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are being assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ism .
the size - there is forced @-@ tro@@ op as well as sevent@@ een @-@ tro@@ op institutions - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the chef will now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz satisfied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are involved much more closely and it is easier to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is why it is about healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help to prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen @-@ power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future of special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service also the charm that they have turned out in cost between self @-@ reg@@ ie and foreign investment for the city as the economic most economical , it is from the press office .
and that , although 46 sub@@ time forces are newly adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the age range not so strong in the weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , am@@ tier@@ ender Head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women are competing in the provinces of provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GM@@ B concerns about investments in the Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e factory in Glasgow
a union would like to take a union with managers at the Bis@@ cu@@ it @-@ vend@@ or Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e about the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company wrote about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the plant , next to other products Hob@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea biscu@@ its .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union leaders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would experience as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Fili@@ alle@@ ite of the company the GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e &apos;s to express &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that financing for modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win free clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned .
generations of families have worked here and the labor force concentrate strongly on the local community and the major space of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the increasing cost of life and the chronic output of production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production line at Mc@@ V@@ iti@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ person of Pla@@ dis said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has only yesterday received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment by employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees , that we operate as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our business is continuously checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operative improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site . should we change our operations courses at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the P@@ SG Barcelona warned three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after it has released an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to un@@ load his free@@ wheel clause , but do they have warned Barcelona three years ago in front of the world prayer ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ lowed the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record for more than double the previous mark , while Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar will become the most expensive players in the world and the most affordable pro @-@ sports@@ men of the world . P@@ SG offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GB@@ P per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way to the outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans fores@@ ee is that the club has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of three years ago by the P@@ SG President in front of this prospect ?
as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association that would sign one of the best players of P@@ SG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact her players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish society in the beginning of this summer interest in the P@@ SG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
P@@ SG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained by the former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today &apos;s Car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pap@@ en XV@@ I. , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would have to express her deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or her then false assessment of processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; however , critici@@ zed that in case of reporting on violence in the domain sp@@ at@@ ching with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two things &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the over@@ s in Regensburg no one would doubt that it would have to be &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts , &quot; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; thus the author of Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histor@@ ik@@ erin and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the habit of den@@ ying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the day life experience and prepar@@ es public opinion on keeping it normal for normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also Für@@ oria Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and it &apos;s a fancy fres@@ co@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , they pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have been an entirely normal ped@@ agog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one , ready to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abuse of abuse , also Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often deaf .
completely wron@@ g@@ ly , the author and historian Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann , who written with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &apos; My brother of the Pope &apos; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ em@@ ann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considers the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the education officer Ulrich Weber ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s . &quot; with high p@@ ancy &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in conclusion , it is meant that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied .
especially in high quantity , the punishment for the students could also fall at the same time .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other defend@@ ants , that many victims were the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , even to connect positive memories with it in many cases . &quot;
in an interview , Hes@@ em@@ ann explains why the final report for the mis@@ conduc@@ tion of the sc@@ andal done by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion .
Mr. E@@ em@@ ann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence against the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to one lift many students &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emerged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ er@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , who became in@@ tangible , if a domain set has not brought a top performance .
how do you evaluate as his bio@@ graph for this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself rather , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger seems at all in it .
they are just eight sides dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or co @-@ value in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also , the acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool were conce@@ aled outside of its efficiency .
you can pres@@ ump@@ ire to him , learn from it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough .
the dom@@ es@@ eng@@ ing school , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus , the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes a very excellent record , describes it as a &quot; warm @-@ nat@@ ured &quot; , &quot; sincere , &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who cat@@ ered the guys regularly with cakes , biscu@@ its and bon@@ b@@ ts and &apos; always covered by grapes of children .
only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emo@@ tion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ brü@@ chen .
that he did not only cold with chairs and threw the key@@ word on the ground , but also ear @-@ co@@ wardly s@@ ke@@ wed guys to the hair or ears , he has already assigned himself years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for exc@@ used .
to his honor of salvation , however , must be said that such educ@@ ational methods were widespread in the fra@@ y period , the 1960s and the 1970s , while parents like with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a world school , a state Gymnasium .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , are the freedom of Bagh@@ dad .
as you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ tance and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media have just rus@@ hed to him .
on the Bavarian State , many who have never understood him before , still eager .
the truth is : the report dra@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen reports have been reported .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also put a burden on sexual abuse in the final report also with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : very clearly no .
no only of the 67 victim sexu@@ als claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a du@@ ped for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent on the silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , but a colleague of the perpetrators would have been a colleague of the perpetrators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abnorm@@ alities ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : an question@@ able student formed it this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no means in which he would have had timely findings and could have been in the respective perpetrators .
I consider it ... also for really absurd , accepting that themselves ... Bu@@ ben su@@ sten@@ si@@ bly or more clear or more likely to have opened than in relation to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ or , confidence , etc .
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they trusted him in advance for the first time concerned , and / or whose environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of charge .
so it cannot be dis@@ car@@ ded , it does not prevent or brought it to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look forward in the report &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and ver@@ ted became a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is precisely the abuse of the report .
namely , namely clean : between the pre @-@ school and the gram@@ mar school of the cathedral sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , let &apos;s say other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report has been treated from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral leader of the sp@@ at@@ ching .
the whole aw@@ ful ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where knot@@ s of sa@@ west teachers were viol@@ ated and mal@@ app@@ alled and among them , all suffered from the pre @-@ school at Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to be ruled out .
but with those called Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the dom@@ es@@ ing school .
in that was , as most witnesses emphasize , the theme &quot; Pre @-@ School &quot; tab@@ oo .
you were only happy to be able to escape and sav@@ oring the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : there has been discipline , but just no more pronounced violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims were the general humanity of R. , and therefore in many cases , even to connect positive memories with him . &quot;
thus , at most still the accus@@ ation had to be seen .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he just did not listen and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again in 1993 .
only Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently lay the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ Gymnasium , which the report was even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in that he points to this point , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , he will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in view of the danger of negative press , he recommended pressing steps .
this was of course at a time when the legal clarity was , as the audi@@ tor of Bavaria has long since been banned .
before that they opened up in a legal gray area , as everyone of us probably knows .
there was also difficult to estimate for him where the people were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded .
you can also not say , he would have always looked at it .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria too .
Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis asser@@ ted yes it is unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards to the former times .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : we have historians talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fall@@ on of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus the danger of jud@@ g@@ ages according to today &apos;s moral measures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess has already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was vile and not for what has been broken in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence at inno@@ cent nursery , that goes far beyond that time .
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ conditioned .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear @-@ co@@ wardly and the hair and ears to pull , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment then banned , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what picture of his rainy season Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has played in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
came the subject audi@@ ted to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI from his perspective , as the cathedral played only a secondary role .
nevertheless , I don &apos;t know that he has led a strict regime there .
but that has to be said once again : without this per@@ tin@@ ent discipline , without which demand un@@ related discipline , it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g , true cultural botan@@ ists of Europe and his musical tradition , which went immediately twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscu@@ its and Bon@@ dies alone , one does not make a big singer and before every success , right in what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of man do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ em@@ ann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and over again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , deeply unbelie@@ ving and cordial man , from which one could not imagine that he could do something too .
I regularly get up with how many former dom@@ es are still alive today , 23 years after its Emer@@ gence , regular contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him like a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him today that he once was strict with them , so are clearly in the minority .
most dom@@ es are grateful to him today that he en@@ riches their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely respect person , to which they still watch today and to honor them .
and please , once again quite clear : all that you cast him are educational methods that were at the time of the day .
we can be glad we have recently overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at .
that is the evil intention behind it , that is only too obvious .
because the report , which was just published , relie@@ ved it .
now the dec@@ ency areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally to leave in peace .
