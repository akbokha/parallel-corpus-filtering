<seg id="2">A Irren Anstalt, where people should encounter young people today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel, which is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners for the first reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories to come.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's annoying if landcards are not currently available.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had already been working on an upright position, because the car Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a stringroad.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "the historical maps of the" "" "digital Bayern Atlases" "", "an offer of the Geo-Portal" "" "Bavaria of the State Government" "" "are anything but up to date - but that is why it is very complex." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it is clear how cities and villages in the area of Munich's spread-area have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a makeshippings that one does not recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the large overview map for cities and parishes more detailed maps, so-called Urpositional blades were incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="13">These arisen according to the Bavarian Government administration between 1810 and 1864 and expelled the first Vermessung Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalitionalist war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished for an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical picture of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops ended with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbour, which created the idea of a nationwide Bayern card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Government administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositionsblatt for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the other on the website of the Bayerisches Landesbibliothek zu Munich.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the morning / today is most impressive at the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling, 21 years after the creation of the map, 1877, as the Munich part of Munich, was incorporated.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today subsendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Austria are concentrated in 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in writing ouns a small-minute card with dozens lines and numbers: handwritten flute-pieces from the so-called "urine view" which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels currently occupy no farmers anymore but small gardener of the complex "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is spread north of undersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 swing of the October fests, was in the 19th century actually still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositional leaf, one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidar not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or of the height "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, you once again drive people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner-Irrenanstalt" "" "built at the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard passed the establishment - that psychiatrist who was brought to death by King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig's VII.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended the dressing of the so-called Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also allowed the staff to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum Haidar, who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first had been space, later on 500 places was expanded.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity also reached no longer - the reason for the construction of the circular anstalt in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum München-East, one of Germany's largest Psychiatrien Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">The camp site of the former Auer Anstalt are now meeting young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football ground of the TSV Munich east, east of the dwellings of the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015 the children" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was set up in arquitecation in the country of origin of the Irrenanstalt during World War II during the Second World War." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was around 1856 as "main square," the merchant road was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies, in December 1944 many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business buildings and a pit chapel from the Middle Ages were once placed on the Marienhof, where these days the pre-work and on 5 April 2017 the spade are made for the second S-railway line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slide, the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national union of the promotion of colored has issued a warning for colored men who travel due to discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state Missouri, which is to come into force until 28 August 2017, calls for afro American travelers, visitors and Missourians to bring attention to the state, as a series of fragworthy, rapping-based incidents in recent times occur and here," said it is in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination, as well as the prosecutor of the state that disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of citizens' rights that happen to men.</seg>
<seg id="55">They are pulled together because of their skin colour, they are merged or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group noted incidents like racist arrests against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline had no gasoline during the journey and was taken away by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed out a recent report of the Office of the General Assembly of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists are more common in the state 75 percent more common than White.</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready whether there are chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100-hate-hate in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate-line reporting programme of the FBI, which ranks the state with respect to the number of such injuries at the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it more difficult to cover a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously the American Civil Rights Union (ACLU) had published tours for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws, the local criminal authorities pledge to impede people due to migrate clashes, which will contribute to the ACLU to further refunds.</seg>

<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestags Peter White and Kordula Kovac gave himself a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the right-grabenhof of the Schwendemann family representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local federations met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two parliamentarians.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into its operation, where he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 cows, and also many young animals, and in five apartments resort hosts.</seg>

<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure that we have, are people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operation," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the support</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013 there were a total of 25 plots of eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The closing area is 40 hectares, which can not be picked up until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter contributed to the municipality of fishing villages.</seg>
<seg id="87">In this way, farmers have to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann.</seg>

<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime changes is it when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the groomed downfall of Saddam Hussein at the Firis Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-régime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic bxt in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have disguised him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their importance, and in particular the importance he was written as the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, his base was added.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Abcosta, I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you refer to, that is later added and is not part of the original freedom of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is correct correctly, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about story.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the moving words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrant, but the poorest of the poor: "your natured, your poor, / your depressed masses who yearn to breathe, free to breathe, / to destroy the waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed in literary criticism - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who set themselves to place their words after their death on the base - were very good that they accomplished a high political act.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism, showing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract, she has obtained a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And exactly as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, people wanted to change from the right wing already long.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty, was arguing that the Statue of Liberty is not an early Neoconservative that bring the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not supposed to enlighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here on something razor.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is entirely and certainly a question of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was in them to see them as they did from the exhaustive but hopeful people after lengthy and often terrible trips on the Decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense it is about seeing the world from the perspective of men who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch should not enlighten the path but hatred that is their only source of power to ignite.</seg>

<seg id="161">The father of our country knew anything of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers smote him because of everything, from internal policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He sweeps with criticism, sure.</seg>

<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Rights Union complained him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The rod of the Governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a backlash reaction with "Na, and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it is only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitler head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his haired head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blockade of individuals who come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially named and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post defaulted Hoal spokeswoman Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockade of the comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too simple to use the image of trolling or spammers or hasserting people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by the Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>

<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can make sure the money loose, that Neymar underwrites and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the rich rulers of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations may apply much money to the acquisition of players, but they must be controlled with legitimate insertions, which enable them to make a break-on point in their on football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after its election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that associations, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheating and risky to ruin when banks or owners moved their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, the novel Abramovich originally used in 2003 - a club with potential and then strongly invested to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, you can take clubs losses in the amount of 30 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen by the presidency in the Ungnade, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to keep away from excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible at the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a package cup, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its Treaty.</seg>
<seg id="1137">"" "" "" "Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so it can be transferred to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements for the next five years." ""</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has made the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received an exit of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the teams for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is searching for clubs that might try to override their financial review by reassed their revenue by companies that are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not apply this as legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA was blown by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come on payments of the organizational Committee of the World Cup 2006 in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar World Ambassador will become and a such maneuver for the UEFA regulators can be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to consider the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no previous talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, sagging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in sales of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published yet.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymous arrival is a boon for Sponsoring Deals, merchandising and tricot purchases.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will increase.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see and she tried to prevent Neymous waymark by declaring that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financing" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the President of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katars last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">The large living live: mezzanine and clever designers have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former bankers with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">Located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was similar to my prize.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square, large apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a covered layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne reservoir and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to make the 12,5 ft high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so they were stacked out without that we had to mosquitoes.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not just about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with much extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper set window from Retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Gluing gold furniture, silverne accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance they have mirrored units space for all cutters and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of living room can close the kitchen when it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a cloister.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering work went in," says Erfan from the steel-reinforced MDF-door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is reciprocally important, so when you push the door, very easily gleaming."</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage room, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², one extra bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimental form becomes a real estate makler, and can perform a calculation based on the bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the ground surface and use high-quality materials which give the room its luxury advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and who therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not adore you into the electrical plug in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be characterized by good design and increased square meters of slightly brightly into something quite amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If yes, it will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope to keep the boss on an equal course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Staff of the White House, on his first working day with leading employees, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House which he wanted to fix: bad information that fall into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about it should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waitys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tump Trump by monitoring its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television reaches decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs received," said the former electoral campaigning Sam Nunberg in February versus Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that "the key to keep Trumping Twitter's habit under control, according to six former constituent officials to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobprice."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever" "" "was ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campagitators know something that we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets would have to contain even more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweet, the trump did not send.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have made it a couple of times, stopping anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevented it that Trump checversen calls forth.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, which consists of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by promoting Trump Material, which might promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to lead the president of strategic reasons without doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react to negative press releases, above all such with damaged leaks, and that it appears to find out where these come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly what happened at the end of February when someone gave the President malwillingly a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet-provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, which accused the deputy staff of Katie Walsh, "the source behind a heap to be from Lecks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banished because of snicanen permanently from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has expressed false preconceptions in the past and voke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh. "</seg>

<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as priebus, but dreump is still his impulsive self and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meet on Wednesday afternoon to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss, which feels safer: they should take their children to the office which were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table in the front of the room: opponents, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdomen range.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drugs schmuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspicious to stand on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and throughout the country the corpses are frequent. at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto died in December 2012. 589 are under attack and threats under Bundesschutz und until now there have been at least seven dead in seven states this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter, their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and being journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence associated with drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Its absence is perceived deeply though its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its middle-finger with the word "Justice," depends on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporter in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show its smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss about their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 a Sonder-Bundesanwalker was established in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murder, which are connected every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are introcated and although the terrain is now still traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of safety has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop" "", "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we do not know why, we mistrust all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May, Valdez abandoned the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelter River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinhala has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as the rivalry factions are fighting to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of enchanted, two-story mausolees for drug could, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" when only a Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">In February the release of a interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartels in the war with Guzmans Sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may be annoyed the sons, suspected gangmembers bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second error was to force Valdez not to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined forces with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the smoke issue, "Bojorquez said.</seg>
<seg id="1847">At the time the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising.</seg>

<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a port worker, the friend, who was generous with hugs and advice strikes, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now ask her: was his love of routine be his grave?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced her to question her own assumptions on how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their inward runway and runways in order to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even at the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing is happening with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a vicious building in a mid-class neighbourhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the Scherz, some of the reporters asked, whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who were the governor themselves as not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months ago since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug polities are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has made three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxing Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state, which focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy journalists and let them reverse because they said the truth.</seg>

<seg id="1928">His incredibly well preserved state has researchers, who describe it as "truly remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved Fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was born on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, den den.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was missing from the surrounding rock at the Platja, and decided to see more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="1932">That was discovered by him Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy mortals.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little with the eyes flashing, you could almost believe it," said the captain Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved Dinosaurs specimens - the Mona Lisa, the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this plant-eater is covered, although it is covered with an armor and a changing tank, probably threatened by meat-made dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide from predators, and used a shielding technology that is known as a counter-coated, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, saying experts, which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodoscopes took headlines for the first time in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was Borealopelta marked with the Museum engineers Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shocks and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shaded, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shaded is customary, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals alive today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure through meat-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution has favoured the deteriorating of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals, which use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or girths - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signaled that this Nodoscopite was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnitier behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs-robbery of chalk-time must have been," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaur was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including its conserous Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, came into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as south florida today, and rivers and oceans probably far more widespread than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodoscopes is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," "" "said Brown." ""</seg>

<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years after Borealopelta lived, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of its frightening ancestors.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday night at the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass karambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometres long steel - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), on the late Thursday afternoon approximately 20 people had been violated.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first data of the police, Adelzhausen und Odelzhausen (Landscape Aichach-Friedberg) were at almost 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm under 30 cars, including trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The exact number of the last documents had no information before.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is about light to medium-sized injuries, said a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large listing of rescue vehicles was at the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, there was a couple of ten kilometres long-repentau.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testers "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing else is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or you are deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the Schaffner and arouses an improper or tear the road in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Driver's check.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently testers the jobless driver control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">It is simply confirmed by mobile phone, that it is taken to its place and is therefore used to control the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation runs on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "comes the offer, we expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it is then expected to be available in Germany in the beginning of next year," "" "said a subway." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort check-in" "" "is called the train run free of charge without work." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">To use this, however, you need to meet some requirements: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you must have booked an online ticket - which is anyway the most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also need to have bought it via the App of the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works so: one gets to the train, calls his ticket under" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">In the test customers a button for the electronic devaluation appears.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train companion get on their mobile devices a message that Fahrgast X has been in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Arrives the train companion in the bike control at number Y he knows that there is a passenger sitting there with already devaluated online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep on silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which again should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "who is relaxed without ticket control through our train service, check out in the DB Navigator just yourself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2010">"" "this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train of personal," "" "says Michael Peterson, Marketing-Board of DB correspondence." ""</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Who often drives track, knows that besides delays and missed the lanes controls are among the largest sleepages.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one does not have any documents in any case, but one of the fellow travelers don't need any documents that are needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the resource ID is missing or otherwise a document that you need to predict.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between Zugcompanion and chassis, which leads to bad mood in the part or large-room and delays in controlling your own tickets and the Schaffner at the end takes time to worry about other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Still only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis, born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year-year-old child, and it is still on the street," "" "says it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Bewildered, because no one else had posted the information on her Feed, she completed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ Theepharoah was constantly regenerated on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officers in Ferguson, Mo., killed live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He pokes a picture of Browns lebloous bodies that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "this is wild," "" "thought Ferrell at itself." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later in the evening to tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos from the police band and people, the crying, and from a man who claimed to be a sign with the wording: "Ferguson police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live fairy in which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a bellous dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, escaped another policeman and shouted: "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not common," "" "did Ferrell reminded of her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder, that we have used to ourselves and which we can call it typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt bulk solids.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return trip and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 23 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive the next morning to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in cinemas from the 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, of love and loss, the strength and resistance of resistance, which is from the perspective of the people living in the community and filled the streets to request answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, carried a flowerdress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for this, what they believe?" "" "remember what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">I could not take them, "said Ferrell later.</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know and see it and be reared in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do is free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even though I have the fortune to give her an experience in which she personally knew no objectionable racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local businessman who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared handbags before and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to accept for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after the 9th of August," she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell arrived during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell in mind:" "" "do you want to document or tries to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people, often from White - in a community that benefited from her pain and their resistance ability.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "like Folayan recently explained in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people who were born in Ferguson and grew up, their voices are not centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had worked together with the former Co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area, which is known for his activism around todestrakt Insassen.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought him closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" during the years to Browns.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. we talk," Davis said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people will be represented, as I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells's experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets show" "" "surprising personal aspect of Ferrells life, as she married and marries her wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability at this work and the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells's story repeated the role of the black gay women in the broader black-lives-mattress movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 have shaped the film "Blackmagic Matter" in social media, identify themselves as sul.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement altogether," "" "said Ferrell," "" "and therefore we are constantly struggling from different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to remark that" "" "the movement really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not a affirmatical type of action," "" "when the Ferrell was chosen as heart of the film." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long gone, but the racial connections between the community and the police have continued to continue.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years due to the blockade of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area they called her home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless, they cling to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the South of the pedestrian precinct was splits since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook-Page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to say-Galerie say, "that would be a dream (Anja Becker) or" This would be real class "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no human being "(Siggi Betzen) or simply plain:" size wahn! "(Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city, of which the rest of the business will benefit, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precinct.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall is available, in which 13 direct marketed their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of construction work there will be an end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed with a possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many charging stations are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a neat weekly market, it is all the more important that we remain at least the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Because after all, the goods delivered there is made fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is obendly inexpensive.</seg>

<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a mall with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-Galerie is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a peasant market hall, it is thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the peasant market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that hung on cabling from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and Haarions, which you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyzer consisted a 35-year-old sentence, after having established diplomatic news about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Become resemblance (A suitable similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwoman, and pioneering disassociates whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted through the algorithms for DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as anyone could look with this genomic data - the many ways as they can be interpreted and the indurent determinant of these interpretations - but also to identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already spoke openly about the identification as a woman since their puberty was sentenced in 2013 by 20 votes against the spy law, computer poll and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison their picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a bastic, black-white blfie, in the creing clearly sits on a driver's seat and carries a platformer pergap - associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of her 2012 project. "</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist's portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigar and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg with a press show of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she was not visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so you had contact with Chelsea, and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detainted Muse were unequal to unequal letters, which in the course of two years are interchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They created even one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images," who would foresee a future in which the President Chotas would transform judgment and would be capable to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was in fact just a few days after the book was published, Manning release would demand for seven brutal years in a military event in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also now at the opening of the exhibition something woofer and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions which he actually should fix.</seg>

<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped, by incorporating the 200 letters (or Nukleotide after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) to show how amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring to it is that our genome is not about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too.</seg>

<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, at the navy track, there is to be built on which the tourist track is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing country in the long term, according to the traffic Ministry, the traffic Department will begin to start the track later this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to order and sanship the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country is known especially for the tourism important connection," declared road secretary Klaus Sühl am Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The cost of the repair of the route is about 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">From this sum the country take 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country, will definitely be coordinated, explained Sühl.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the Süddeutsche üringen Bahn as operators are already agreed upon the technical details.</seg>

<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, the track has been tested in the course of a pilot company, whether the course is used by plenty of people to order them in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not yet be crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emerious professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking their ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eyelash of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," "" "Mr. Sharkey said with the release of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpels have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon skin that feels warm to the touch - with deliberately human reactions that are achieved by the artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also customize his robot according to his beliefs, "and select everything from the eyelid of the robot to the type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it will be more disturbing, since many robots have the "personalities," which would let a Stepford woman would be progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpels have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robots allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that find them appealing like fidelity.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robots with pre-programmed figures such as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of relapse and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the website of True Sleion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she does not like what you do not like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she has also her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the undertakingly female properties, the playback on rape, if you go a step on Frigid (is here: reluctance) Farrah, bewilfully a most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true True Pxxxy with a vibration, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However these sex robots are not just a fetish, or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their formation and their growing sophistication indicate something darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not keep having sex robots, and while the FRR notice their increasing popularity, they remain temporary at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what leakooed out of the edge-zones may be in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or abusive until they gave them the free market for them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is however a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time when the rights of women are threatened around the world in which there is a president in the White House, who gave it prayerful to have women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images, the muddy bodies and the selected eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots do not represent real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">You may not separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that may hinder on independence or anything, which could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maid</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps big Performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney as the epitome of a healthy man.</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binsenseless of the Trump era that the political divisions, which polarized the US voters, even families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Harvest dankfest, there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump's relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all supposedly packaged to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power Trumps, families to bring together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my cousin, a left-oriented poet, who lives in Chicago and for a long time engaged with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">It reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican relationship with which she fought for ten-ten years because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">To the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in another context that this will also bring considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disclosing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "if we speak of" "" "normalization" "" "and dump, we refer to the grassy opportunity to not repel us any longer any day." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">There is yet another long-long-long-term scenario, in the Trump Republicans of the Right wing "normalized" that suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the epitome of denial.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's comic version of the accident - the dog on the car tax, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return saw) - both in comparison to Trump in fact occur as a mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must only be mentally healthy in order to qualify as immeasurably improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin in the city was, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the biggest of the caretells of the New York Parkdepartment, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the Fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals verrotate to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-pering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Twenty-five years later, and I'm still not quite happy about the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-Karussell is still a strange experience, since here two two year old, a 11-year-old and two women can go to it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could evaluate the carousel I would have given it the full score, but fortunately no one has asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I took my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house on the corner of my street it's the same thing, plus the option, the rating with a 15% tipping to the same - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apprehensive, while I tired the experience made to reach my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar pistorius with niache from prison to hospital moved</seg>

<seg id="2452">Pistorius was condemned because of a call for the prosecutors of the prosecutor's prosecutors, due to a appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He kills Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, taking it several times through a door of the toiletins in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that was hidden in the cab.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year-old sentence of Pistorius appeal to which they say they are too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "the" "" "national prosecutor" "" "said that they will be registered with the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2491">How exactly is the software update?</seg>
<seg id="2492">Do diesel drivers have to take part in action?</seg>
<seg id="2493">The most important questions and answers in the overview.</seg>
<seg id="2494">In the diesel-summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW company software updates for a total of around 5,3 million cars offered.</seg>
<seg id="2495">They should improve the gas behavior of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6.</seg>
<seg id="2496">Euro-4-diesel or worse are exempt.</seg>
<seg id="2497">Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa are estimations:</seg>

<seg id="2499">No, the negotiated software updates are optional.</seg>

<seg id="2512">Time-consuming may be to get an appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2513">What do drivers do, which do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW company?</seg>
<seg id="2514">The ACE wasp to wait.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Probably foreign manufacturers would withdraw, so Smetanin.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Does now a massive price drop of Euro-4 cars?</seg>

<seg id="2538">And the work always makes it great fun as he conveys in the press conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied, but also demanding tasks which are waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, I wondered that so far no application will fulfill the demands.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineering at the end of time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">Thus, taking into consideration the regular notice of cancellation - still enough time for a review.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach was ensed for the administrative community as a sub-law authority, the applicant has to predict appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If they cannot fill them out this way, the citizens would have to go to advisory services up to Offenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the proximity of the city and himself is important, says Wacker, who reports on a good working environment as well as good mood between the authority and the citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2559">He is a protector, "in the end everything is going through my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">In case of support and coordination, he can count on many years of employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing so, Manfred Schöner (Tiefbau) for 15 years.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory boiling)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims to the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causing stomach cramps and flatulations, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">During those affected usually, meat and dairy products are normally envy to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University came out that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to make sure that damaging microbes that hide themselves in the body not to penetrate into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells, which are capable of eradicating inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the body.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory boiling.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experimentation has been found that a kind of tolerance conveying immune cell was found in mice causing a specific bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the components of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a link between a bacterial art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to tryptophan rich diet is tolerant, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system is also whirlpools.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of academic powers had such cells, but another group of the same tribe who had not been separated, this did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbids of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därts of the mice were found DNA sequential and were found six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without it in the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal microbiome and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria out on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri could grow in a fluid and overled small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells that have been insulated by the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky vH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, the heart of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American building programmes.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter car from Wisconsin and a forklifts from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an fragile order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopters at the South Lawn landed, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event of his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter took place on 17 July at 7 o'clock in the morning at the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock in the morning and remained so long until the lawn was vacated between 18: 00 and 21: 00.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if your departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the restriction of service hours a second team would be needed for the flight back.</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abnormalities of waste discharge pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the misscandal made by the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," explained by the former Regensburger Bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Papen XVI., an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would have to express her deep regret about their own omissions or her then false assessment of processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "however, criticized that in case of reporting on violence in the domain spatching with" "" "two things" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the overs in Regensburg no one would doubt that it would have to be "shameful and shameful acts," but the "degree of medial manipulation," thus the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, Historikerin and Member of the National Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of denying the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the day life experience and prepares public opinion on keeping it normal for normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "also Füroria Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and it's a fancy frescoes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, they pointed out that in her youth" "" "blows" "" "would have been an entirely normal pedagogical means" "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one, ready to be done." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abuse of abuse, also Pope brother Georg Ratzinger was often deaf.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who written with Ratzinger the reminder 'My brother of the Pope' (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he considers the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the education officer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s. "with high pancy" victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in conclusion, it is meant that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in high quantity, the punishment for the students could also fall at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other defendants, that many victims were the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, even to connect positive memories with it in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report for the misconduction of the scandal done by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Eemann, the 440-pages report on the "incidents of violence against the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "to one lift many students" "" "humanity" "" "emerged." ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a cholerker and perfectionist, who became intangible, if a domain set has not brought a top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biograph for this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself rather, why the name Georg Ratzinger seems at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">They are just eight sides dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mediator or co-value in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also, the acts of violence at the preschool were concealed outside of its efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can presumpire to him, learn from it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The domesenging school, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus, the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also describes a very excellent record, describes it as a "warm-natured", "sincere," and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who catered the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonbts and 'always covered by grapes of children.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to Wutausbrüchen.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cold with chairs and threw the keyword on the ground, but also ear-cowardly skewed guys to the hair or ears, he has already assigned himself years ago, deeply regrets and excused for excused.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his honor of salvation, however, must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the fray period, the 1960s and the 1970s, while parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a world school, a state Gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, are the freedom of Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="2926">As you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian State, many who have never understood him before, still eager.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report draet Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report a lot about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen reports have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also put a burden on sexual abuse in the final report also with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No only of the 67 victim sexuals claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or my mother," "" "said a duped for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true problem in the education of sexual abuse was and yet is that most of the victims are silent on the silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, but a colleague of the perpetrators would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in terms of abnormalities?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an questionable student formed it this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no means in which he would have had timely findings and could have been in the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd, accepting that themselves... Buben sustensibly or more clear or more likely to have opened than in relation to their parents, internator, confidence, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that they trusted him in advance for the first time concerned, and / or whose environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So it cannot be discarded, it does not prevent or brought it to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to connect his good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was much of" "" "violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look forward in the report" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything mixed and verted became a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, namely clean: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the cathedral spatzen, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, let's say other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report has been treated from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the spatching.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful pedagogy, the cases where knots of sawest teachers were violated and malappalled and among them, all suffered from the pre-school at Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those called Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the domesing school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In that was, as most witnesses emphasize, the theme "Pre-School" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You were only happy to be able to escape and savoring the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the Domspatzenging school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there has been discipline, but just no more pronounced violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that "many victims were the general humanity of R., and therefore in many cases, even to connect positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most still the accusation had to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he just did not listen and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Only Georg Ratzinger consistently lay the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the DomspatzGymnasium, which the report was even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in that he points to this point," "" "that in the pre-school, he will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in view of the danger of negative press, he recommended pressing steps.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when the legal clarity was, as the auditor of Bavaria has long since been banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they opened up in a legal gray area, as everyone of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also difficult to estimate for him where the people were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">You can also not say, he would have always looked at it.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted yes it is unfair to apply today's educational standards to the former times.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we have historians talk about" "" "Fallon of Anachronism," "", "thus the danger of judgages according to today's moral measures." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was vile and not for what has been broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence at innocent nursery, that goes far beyond that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it will finally be reconditioned.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus ear-cowardly and the hair and ears to pull, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment then banned, he has also kept strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what picture of his rainy season Georg Ratzinger has played in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Came the subject audited to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI from his perspective, as the cathedral played only a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I don't know that he has led a strict regime there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that has to be said once again: without this pertinent discipline, without which demand unrelated discipline, it would probably have been possible to form an institution of world-trang, true cultural botanists of Europe and his musical tradition, which went immediately twice in the US (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and Bondies alone, one does not make a big singer and before every success, right in what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger really well and over again as a wonderful, humorous, deeply unbelieving and cordial man, from which one could not imagine that he could do something too.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get up with how many former domes are still alive today, 23 years after its Emergence, regular contact with him, visit him - he is almost blind - and he will treat him like a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him today that he once was strict with them, so are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domes are grateful to him today that he enriches their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respect person, to which they still watch today and to honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again quite clear: all that you cast him are educational methods that were at the time of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have recently overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">That is the evil intention behind it, that is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report, which was just published, relieved it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the decency areas would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps Germany probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.</seg>
