Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always be in drawers p
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will always put in drawers or get up from the outside label that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself have not the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , these things are rather straightforward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as described in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine . &quot;
at the best , the act@@ ress spends her time at home , pre@@ m television with lo@@ cker@@ em Dut@@ t and Mexican food , says it in the magazine .
to the white @-@ l@@ ut they bring the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; we women have to not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; the Hollywood star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in her new film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dar &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is An@@ iston to be seen as a single mother of two sons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the film runs with us on August 25 .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pyramid
his experiences on the horse are manage@@ able .
at the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with some colleagues on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a couple of minutes the horses remember their holiday , they were hunting in fast Gal@@ op@@ p after home to the feed pairs .
a few kilometers at this pace , I have been afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the equ@@ est@@ rian ended again already again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament win - again near horses .
he allowed himself to lead himself with his family about the plant of the AL@@ RV , to a horse s@@ ang he doesn &apos;t even leave for photographic purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen , and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports club handed over the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small Gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
at hon@@ ours it lacks the sympathetic sports@@ men .
Bundes@@ ver@@ ages kreuz , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ ds , Champions Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already crossed it .
long is the 18th prize winners of the pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize winners by Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for it will be awarded only for sporting achievements but also for social engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he gave the prize money from 25.000 Euro immediately .
with 15 other outstanding sports enthusiasts , the two @-@ fold US mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent include the athle@@ tics and Harald Schmit@@ t , the tower Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ da Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wien@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ rider Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard won@@ dro@@ us .
many of these sports@@ men were on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part the illustr@@ ator emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held a distance to the great animals .
Clin@@ ton and Tr@@ umps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two US presidential points are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosophical difference .
who , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns that the state of the economy can harm , with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton would viol@@ ate the economy to death and to regulate death , he says .
but by contrast it would be quite different , maintains Tr@@ ump .
he will massi@@ vely cut it massi@@ vely , and it makes itself strong for far @-@ reaching controls with lower tax approaches - for private people and for companies .
Clinton says : the state has specific tasks to meet , he has to open a disadvantage of disadvantage and needs money .
therefore , the taxes for the rich would be increased , says it .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ e @-@ like .
democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ of Te@@ y Te@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
thus , on Tr@@ ump , you might still have a partial internal discussion .
clear are the differences in energy and climate policies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ power plants and over@@ drive coal production in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton aims to expand renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - also at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ ac@@ fish trade deal , do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the US by international trade - but simply protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these should then also be better paid , calls for instance Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be , then he says he should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy on the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth .
his critics were before him , so that the budget deficit would just be even bigger .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics are saying : more taxes are not the solution .
escape : &quot; every f@@ aded woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who flee their own lives alone , almost in everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby at the most one year old .
one has placed her little son in his arms .
he is curious with great eyes in@@ quis@@ itive into the room .
his mother rigid on the table top .
until they notice they will be observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is a business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief services in Bavaria , and is concerned among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are p@@ lowed .
they live in Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ chner &apos;s women &apos;s assistance .
recently , it was officially opened .
60 people live there - approximately 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - also not as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persec@@ uted because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ aling yourself secre@@ tly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honor@@ ary , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example to demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that as soon as they are ank@@ men in Germany , ir@@ re , told B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also here all women in refugee are often considered inferior and worse .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women , who live in Munich &apos;s accommodation in Munich , are traumati@@ zed .
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created . &quot;
many women are so accustomed that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust , speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because they often don &apos;t know how to help , there will need more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question , whether they are using a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , respond some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is such a thing in accommodations among governments .
also in Schw@@ aben , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ preaching of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken , there are in some common shel@@ ters or their own homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or become accommodated men and women , it can become more continual violence against women . &quot;
the washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women in the study .
how much the women feel this protective cover , one can count on the con@@ gestion whom there is at the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have been talking about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has spoken to us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance activists : demands for new work amp@@ ant measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deputy of the assistance authorities have called their trade union to author@@ ise new workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to author@@ ise new work measures with respect to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council to author@@ ize more work measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that there had failed ministers to respond to the concerns of the contract .
assistance agents and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract that has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members that was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the leader of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government was &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently calm &quot; to have problems , which resulted in the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has voted the proposed new contract to fully reject and official new negotiations have been concerned about all editions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board approved a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to find a running program escal@@ ator , which begins in early September .
the disputes carried out that assistance in the case of ass@@ ays will strike the first total breakdown in the history of the N@@ HS .
the leader of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istenz@@ ists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to rejection of the agreed contract terms , which were recommended by BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during meetings , which were still ahead of voting by 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istenz@@ ists and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
following the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be forced to be forced .
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external lateral &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and proc@@ laim an official end of the eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin percei@@ ves his Turkish counter @-@ players in the gold Hall of St. Peter &apos;s Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles had scar@@ ed and he did hardly any heat , even for his back @-@ held circumstances .
Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report whole five times .
I could no longer count .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels prior to the crisis , but could even improve .
the next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had beha@@ ved so badly as if nothing had happened .
his enthusiasm was rather the opposite to indicate .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cool showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory : the overthrow of a Russian struggle aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was de@@ br@@ ated .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to please Russia to the back .
the accident was even bigger , as it was committed by a alleged friend .
the c@@ ro@@ b will rebuild again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
months long , the state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed like the Turks to blame for everything .
the most serious accus@@ ations were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdogan &apos;s own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic state .
he has denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a ceas@@ e@@ fire lie clearly on hand .
Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat was at the top of his ministry .
repeti@@ tive terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him too .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast .
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be relie@@ ved if the flights are picked up again .
you are counting on a late seasonal an@@ il@@ storm in the Mediterranean .
this week forec@@ ast@@ ed the state television cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agr@@ arian imports will be allowed once again .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti it follows : &quot; tourists staying there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West as it seeks its reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll come across the cutting @-@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the first to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty that he called for the elected government authorities after the attempted coup d &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a doubt for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a profound fear of regime change .
the summit in this spl@@ endor@@ ous palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey , one , as it once described a analy@@ st , &quot; alliance of external lateral &quot; : two countries who rejected themselves from the West and feel badly treated .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently res@@ igned the role as a pe@@ ac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both presidents said on the press conference , they did not even so@@ ften the subject .
the president of Turkey failed to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize that .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey de@@ ple@@ ted to the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
according to the Board R@@ BS , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office roll .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand linked with the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago almost collap@@ sed and saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; during this time we used the R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they supported the international sport with millions pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all R@@ SB references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand of Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private customer business which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the R@@ SB brand becomes our Invest@@ ors mark as well as the brand that our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank has become a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global targets , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own communities , and our staff will work under these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that there will be his six Nations sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the perceptions of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the Bank of brands because how do we focus ourselves ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Board of Directors .
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bench for our customers and would have launched these marks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can beat these marks again , so I think that the time has come .

Russia Putin dam@@ ert Stab@@ ili@@ f Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin released his staff of Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years of the eng@@ agements undertaken by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environment and Transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been using Ivan@@ ov &apos;s representative since 2012 was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at .
in 1972 , Tallinn , he was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his degree at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s message .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it says ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol and staff manager of the government .
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a stat@@ ute of legislation and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and advised V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mystical .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the most eng@@ agements Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , K@@ GB .
as a staff member , he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the staff will be res@@ igned on their own request .
but despite the sm@@ iles for cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
here is the consequence of a sort of power @-@ struggle ?
this is currently no one knows .
but the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president , who would like to lead Russian environmental policies - came across great skep@@ ticism .
in his comments on Putin , who quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov &quot; it &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , told me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years .
as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the state security service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin called to power , he called Ivan@@ ov than one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once , Ivan@@ ov after Putin &apos;s second term president may be president of Russia , as a third presidential term coup against the constitution would have been rejected .
but this post was taken by another , close allies Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he made producers

ri@@ ddle of fish , which landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded for the identification of the fish assistance in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act on the 75 fishing around Sand@@ als , which were split by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ bridge crossing : bridge now connected with fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the iconic ferry cros@@ sover with the vi@@ adu@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four entries of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which approach to each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge of Fi@@ ves is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rop@@ es .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown became a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ tier cros@@ sover .
we are all witnesses of engineers from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the decay between the vi@@ adu@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
altogether , nearly 79 % of the entire bridge dates back to their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks , today in Ros@@ y@@ th gets a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first registry represents a significant milestone in each Brü@@ cken@@ projekt .
in this fantastic project the revers@@ ing high@@ - and low @-@ construction is represented .
after installing the last road lines and its connection with the expansion of Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to then close an even existing gap on the north or country side .
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the vi@@ adu@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , approximately 6,000 tonnes weighs and had to be pulled up at a slope of approx . 3 % upwards .
heat , since the toler@@ ances that the team works , tiny - on each side they bore only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
saving in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness yet to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown away by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ station hit Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in safety while their boat moved from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and placed us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the lif@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds has already stayed apart from their range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 , and on a shelf without life@@ jacket has been found .
they arrived all on board the coastal re@@ board and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men that were cast into the water have been lucky and still being alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat motor has a con@@ sti@@ p@@ one , but this sol@@ dering itself in the c@@ ots of the bot of the person who controlled the boat .
someone has wondered about these men today .
badly hurt - man sti@@ cky on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .

these aler@@ ts as a result of his sister .
together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with their partner .
on the street she met the ex @-@ life @-@ partner of the man .

who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and green mine : investors are supposed to become much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting accommodation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next round session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programming .
first and foremost , it is about the question : who is to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is now lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD Group Leader of Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future , needs 20 percent of all apartments as social @-@ homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be kept in the stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great dispute in the city hall is , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you go to investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to have at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban building building program that will cost millions of money and must be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as a few rules as possible .
the left does still want to have tou@@ gh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of what viol@@ a , viol@@ a , b@@ ah@@ ne is an exac@@ er@@ bation of the situation in the housing market .
the action concept is implemented , which will ensure additional tasks in the administration administration .
more staff will be needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program still stands out completely : for the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you feel the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments , whose support is going out in the coming years ?
only up to 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
to prevent this , so the plan@@ atory spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ ongoing ties of the city .
also , it would have to be thought to take back apartments back into the price .
this is possible in the West city .
on one fell sw@@ oop the problem can be solved .
because in the West@@ town run for the year @-@ end deadlines .
some 1800 apartments could be transported back to the price of cheap apartments .
only : this is not wanting the owners , the housing companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the number of social apartments in the West city increased dras@@ tically , the aim of so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mess &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few districts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must be connected to the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and child are no longer going to go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time , star@@ ing on screens , has been lo@@ dged over the last decade of many .
at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and to be more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and most recently to smartphones .
therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was based on the characters who were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later emerged from the cartoon , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest in the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server over@@ sized the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as a tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players with their smart phones go out and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are re@@ trac@@ ed with a GPS and once they were once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person has returned every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es the Washington Post recently , that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of persec@@ uted people running every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and be active every day , because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be assessed .
anyone regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that people do it to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people close to the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as usual there are also m@@ ashed gam@@ ers who must always complain about something .
and yes someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it is a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit has already been able to trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and use it with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more active , fit@@ ter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the New Testament
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is available on all this .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ad .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American g@@ ymn@@ ast da@@ w@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ ring title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
their total output of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and the &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ da@@ ill@@ en@@ gel@@ ist Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the American Simone Bil@@ es , built on the pig @-@ beams during the individual multi @-@ race of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ a is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American female , which wins a multi @-@ campaign , and a total of the fifth , whereas they soli@@ di@@ fied their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
it broke out tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment .
this success represents them in the same league such as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ it has dominated the last three years its sports@@ wear - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton from her said that she is &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it was a final exam in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load over@@ sized expectations .
not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas return , would be regarded as disappointment .
the American , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace themselves , after they have won gold and silver in the retail majority of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ it took the first medal on Tuesday , while she was at the farewell party of the team @-@ coordinator , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as a sign @-@ for .
although Bil@@ it existed , during their long stretch on the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of her ground exercises - which included its typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother was discovered during a school@@ ing in the g@@ ymnasium , in which Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the power .
in the summer of 2013 , it has been no more lost , a winning series that will keep as long as it wishes to be .
even if Must@@ af@@ ina introduced through two sets , decei@@ ves the image .
Schwe@@ be@@ ys and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ it holds the world title - loud .
they went back up with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance sheet - and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ um - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears from Bil@@ it shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection @-@ book , became reality .
the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a bass player went to Must@@ af@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ capitalists had been named by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; a lead .
after their ground practice she threw out to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ ields , b@@ lown away by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared doub@@ t@@ ful .
what it concerns , so he quickly developed a whole new meaning in the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial fall at the music stop in the car
according to the police report that were published on Thursday two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial attack of Phoenix , while they were talking in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stefan@@ ie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car , and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report to read .
the police reported that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who took possession of an adult victim .
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators would deny a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
altogether , predominantly in Hisp@@ anic dwell@@ ers were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two others were injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; divided Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to conclusions that the attacks are linked to and by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ized because of their injury and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on the spot .
a witness shared the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the sliding on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ times murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a bul@@ let out of the seat as well as pu@@ question@@ ing from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old likes Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the least of its Alter@@ enjoyed has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during their pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought I made it .
I do not do this .
I did not let myself down .
what is not true at all -- of course one has settled on it , &quot; she said .
your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund they may never recognize them , and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they prefer to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the aid of a secret aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cr@@ ush up to his third year of age and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something in front of &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him a sign in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is no typical sign @-@ language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as Mas@@ quer@@ ying or the coron@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it is affecting the life of the infected man .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remember the emotional price of a certain future .
I wondered what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know it really .
I did not ask for a prognosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can truly say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the coron@@ avirus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives cause of rescue in Louis@@ iana , Mississippi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Louis@@ iana forced the governor to rest on Friday the emergency room . it is calculated all Saturday over with more rainf@@ all .
numerous streams in the southeast of Louis@@ i@@ anas and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and dro@@ ught with large @-@ scale floods after extreme rainf@@ all reported the National Wetter@@ dienst .
the Gover@@ nor of Louis@@ iana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to the affected municipalities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ole of Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags had requested .
a flood warning system will be used over large parts in the south of Louis@@ i@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service has been sil@@ enced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches in rain could fall .
in the south of Alabama , a floo@@ ding system was used on Friday while in the area of Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Louis@@ iana , will all probability reach the weekend record .
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could over@@ lap many houses in the suburbs of Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a current floo@@ ding flood in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a threat , as these are only slowly flowing over the Lake Mau@@ re@@ as .
the river ti@@ ro@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Louis@@ iana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still sli@@ pped people from the fl@@ ut@@ al water in the districts Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son @-@ son found themselves under those who were saved near Glo@@ be near Glo@@ be .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which usually lies more than 400 feet away from his house , over night greatly increase .
he said that he was another st@@ son who lives nearby who would have warned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have awakened and the water flo@@ cked and flooded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it achieved my wa@@ ist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , in which she lived there never had seen such a strongh@@ old of the river .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the only thing that can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer would have saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ be , where they were accommodated up to Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had quickly spread &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities will be considered ev@@ acu@@ ating instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been substantially full of rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that serious rainf@@ alls and street flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ a Par@@ ish and educational cut in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an ordered in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 surviving houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which are now both flooded .
the Vor@@ steh@@ er of the municipality Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed from high water .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency facilities were set up to accom@@ o@@ date the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will be back into their homes again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were made almost two d@@ utz@@ ous roads due to the flood closed and sand@@ bags made available for residents to take the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to become a similar incident .
in the pp , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it continues to rain on the gul@@ f coast .
according to his details , a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as overweight but on Friday has not been reported until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; from sco@@ ops , &quot; survived sho@@ cking in Philadelphia
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grandparents gave that Brown suffered several qu@@ orum , including in the harvest , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in his transportation to the hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was crossed by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ne@@ z on the transm@@ itter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was regarded in a hospital as critical and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the transm@@ itter that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people arrested in German@@ town .
they were also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported on the transm@@ itter .
the other two victims were not found in the car and police find exactly whether under one of the last men of the perpetrators they could find themselves .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia to appear to be a crus@@ fire between several guns .
Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for storm @-@ rif@@ le , which were trac@@ ed to different storm @-@ rif@@ les , over@@ lap the scene .
it seems that this is clearly a permanent battle .
on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were sle@@ eves .
so it appears to have been given several armed fighters , who were very active , &quot; shared police @-@ p@@ mann Anthony G@@ inal@@ di police in Philadelphia to the transm@@ itter .
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ aters in the arm when she played in front of her house in the West O@@ ak Lane .
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that &apos;s what I present myself under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ ic rule in the Tur@@ tles and that is more than one reason .
first of all I have been in the Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner@@ inside , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin @-@ colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics , makes every pride .
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympics in winning and the Americas .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez how they expected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ mas@@ tics delivered .
on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American female , who won gold medal at an individual multi @-@ ring event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but you do not see sne@@ ak classes across the country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to create it in the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks so that turbines are a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner can be maintained primarily in private turn@@ outs which will be maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel and hotel expenses ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) . the list can continue to continue .
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these verses the Tur@@ ner will receive her whole training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the tur@@ ings .
we have to be inspired to the con@@ greg@@ ations of innumerable , young girls , which are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a better and easier to access sports .
I was founded my turn@@ out of 20 years .
we offer free and affordable tur@@ ers in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ ers who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
tur@@ ne develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination of the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health as well as for training and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this squ@@ ad that bring thousands of young girls interested in the turmoil and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
it is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the olymp@@ ic team Con@@ gol@@ ds and thank you for so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance authorities wish to organize more strikes after having rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts proposal
the Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by accepting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ ary of the British Medical Association but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 Ass@@ istenz@@ ists who vote on a choice they rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans revealed , revealing the treaty and said that N@@ HS was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay to the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first ass@@ istants should receive a new contract that includes changes to mo@@ ths and weekend to improve the care of sexual movement .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ ed for Ass@@ ess@@ arians shared last night in a communication with : &quot; Ass@@ istenz@@ ists have committed to the proposed treaty , in particular that it will sanc@@ tioned the current occupancy crisis and there will be anything to treat all doctors . &quot;
in just eight weeks that still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time goes out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute through talks were to take part in the government for the sake and sometimes in a de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this happened by a promise , the Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t have to act now , to raise the vibration and to address the concerns of the assistance authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
should he do not do this , it has clearly stated the assistance authorities , that they are ready to perform further work amp@@ ant .
the last strike in the end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine stations and 100,000 appointments were involved , as nur@@ ses and specialist practitioners were involved to provide doctors on the strip chain .
the Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by accepting the reform@@ ist contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better Wo@@ ch@@ end@@ ow@@ ment for the 5@@ 4.000 Ass@@ istenz@@ ists who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , requested the assistance authorities to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work amp@@ ant measures achieve nothing of the only little , stra@@ ining , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing homes and their families only concerns , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the last two months , we have talked to the help of the assistance authorities and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries in relation to the concerns with regard to the tut@@ el@@ age and the wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training courses and the gender @-@ specific pay@@ roll in medicine - a sign of how serious it was to employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day@@ - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack are benef@@ itted from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after being advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the em@@ inn@@ ate drug ti@@ z@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ edi@@ fication .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or another heart attack .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years long intake in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of this suffer from a further heart attack or stroke .
heart attack and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations caused by fatty materials in the ar@@ ter@@ ien@@ w@@ änden .
when the day breaks apart , it can cause a blood@@ stream that causes blood flow to the heart and thus caused a heart attack .
when the blood@@ stream trig@@ gers , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to have another .
Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots .
the leader of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Center : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attack and stroke among people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to extend their treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft bill is not recommended for treatment that proceeds over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ure@@ ter &apos;s election was blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
the former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ers has led to that widespread electoral successes in Muslim communities will not know@@ ingly ignored like a crus@@ hing government &apos;s report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ cles is part of the police , electoral monitoring and Rath@@ geber to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excess abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survivors regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and community government , who is now a face @-@ corrupt , said that it should be allowed to set up inti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ fs so badly that the police should be allowed to build ab@@ sper@@ ous tapes outside of constitu@@ ency in order to protect voters .
he recommends that voters should lead a pass in order to prove their identity by elections .
at present a vot@@ er must simply call his name and address .
the report proposes to refu@@ te not removal tin@@ te on the finger of a person if they give up their choice , to avoid that somebody is choosing twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions of non official Kom@@ mit@@ as or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for voting , but is also intended to protect the municipal government in front of the broader corruption and financial culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets constitu@@ tions as in the east of London .
last year a Special Tribunal decided that the official Mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man to cor@@ rupted a lit@@ re in cor@@ rupted and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man would have had the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical way , &quot; that he would have been sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ gregation and Islam@@ op@@ hob@@ last alleg@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , where one person chooses one another .
Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming up to the frau@@ dul@@ ent stamp - in the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the bond of balances out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the elder , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ archy or ban@@ quet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... government institutions would have ignored such behaviour due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ sensitivity regarding the eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tougher registration tests to prevent that the electoral code is used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to consider voters in front of the choice to ask for your credit card .
not aw@@ able ink use on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to avoid that someone chooses twice .
systematic verification of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are either entitled .
a three @-@ year limit to requests to an automatic stamp .
ban that political activists process complete let@@ ter@@ sel@@ ections and covers of correspondence .
the police give the authority to set up compensation for voting stations .
a legislative change which facilit@@ ates a charge for inti@@ mid@@ ation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ular Act 1983 ) .
photographers offered in election stations .
request that only English can be used in the voting stations ( except the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees tend to enforce that voters are going to go alone into the constitu@@ encies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets you have no ray show . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ re of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been found guilty of a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ised the useless &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ ies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Rath@@ ter@@ houses &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court part of Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral campaigns and the denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ doubled in and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympics in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio will take this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pauline Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and the band that turned out to be an impressive double @-@ type in the heart of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ian in this summer is by far not the only one in order to be gold fighters who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if you should believe the social media faith .
hon@@ our@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ pped at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ icles , which have more than just a certain similarity with wood @-@ known celeb@@ rities .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ lis@@ on , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
besides K@@ ate doubles in the cycle , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ers of the Gem@@ ini Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin Towers of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ lis@@ on has caused a rush on Twitter after images , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street star un@@ secre@@ tly similarly .
in fact the ar@@ cher was given the madness into the social media and gave to that he has been hearing from childhood since childhood , that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see a major similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I want to compli@@ ment it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the pending similarity between the British historian Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian g@@ ymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes will be as double @-@ in for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nette that has similarly heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the son@@ nen@@ geb@@ ted skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was attacked Adrian of fans , a &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy that others have noticed the similarities
theory placed in the room : according to this user there might be a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps a reason
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US @-@ football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes .
other popular Ver@@ posted Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the female act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own gorgeous , wide smile , resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the criticism against B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard , where there were many speech to him
Twitter @-@ User stopped not back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ bel B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .

short time later he apologi@@ zed Scott Rus@@ sel who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming pool . &quot;
it was a unhappy chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC apologi@@ zed at the end of more than 90 times among the people who responded to the comments on Twitter

C@@ BC copied and fed his ap@@ ology with more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments from Mac@@ Donald
the network also apologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret it sincerely that these statements were made and that it was made possible that they will be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday evening we quickly apologi@@ zed to our spectators on the show and our fol@@ l@@ wer@@ n in social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ald comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy formulation . B@@ yron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon he apologi@@ zed Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to act as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I did after the Frauen@@ schwi@@ mm@@ ers in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ let , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have taken on the performance of the swi@@ mmer in and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no con@@ temp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ör@@ t about woman who tried in the middle of business under@@ wear under@@ wear
the buyers did not know where to see where to see her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try to try shelter .
to wor@@ sen the situation , they mu@@ stered them as she looked at it , she moved out and laid her back into the shelf .
they browse on and tested four pairs under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she turned back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the stalls , they took a pair of under@@ pants from the situation , drew their own shr@@ ubs and pants and prob@@ es them .
&quot; she did not even tried to find a slightly discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ red when they turned out the under@@ pants , which you obviously have not fallen , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that her nothing was playing , and went out again .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bother that she was watching someone watching or about the person who would buy the under@@ pants that they tried them . &quot;
Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; as contradic@@ tory that someone would take shelter with home who had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to draw the garments out of the sale after she went - what is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman she had and returned and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com might make it more secure for you .
we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ anas in New York to find out how to deal with armed inc@@ ense .
regardless of whether you move from the front or from behind you will show you this video as you revol@@ ve around the mirror for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you move from behind you , then you should turn your att@@ acker , so that you can see your att@@ acker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you turn it into your face with your free el@@ bows .
beat him then with the knee in the bar and turn , while the att@@ acker is collap@@ sed off pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move back , while they direct the weapon to him .
with att@@ ackers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the loop , grab the gun and ver@@ rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
transfer the weight on the gun at the same time and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the gun from his grip before they move back and set the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi Pre@@ mature .

a British traveler drew its immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex in a serious examination - by lowering some of the har@@ dened and ec@@ el@@ dest places of Europe .
the moder@@ ator and tour @-@ author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k shot his course at the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sin@@ king kno@@ b and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
in front of the dem@@ ise of each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and to show us what he is going to be in .
but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , brought some surprising results to day@@ light .
the thought , the dish@@ was@@ hers of a train@@ in@@ lets that has been used by thousands of others may be totally agon@@ izing , but in fact they are in a kitchen rin@@ se more poor bacteria .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria and his own health .
fortunately nothing left , what he stretched , more than a bad dessert in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate himself as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations to flush cr@@ abs of toilets , the task set its immune system definitely below a sample
in the film , he told : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , the earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was sure to meet his reputation in any case .
the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test @-@ line showed a L@@ umin@@ ome@@ ver of over 4000 units .
compared to this , L@@ umin@@ ome@@ mann is fresh washed hands less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to cut off after their L@@ umin@@ ome@@ ver was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one of less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o made the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes the worst thing I have spent in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing smar@@ ter than that !
I will nothing an@@ gled here because it is in@@ doors here .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company dedicated Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intest@@ ine bacteria and immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explained the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings so that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian calling us . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of the gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had some of the things I have reli@@ ed upon it , just like the ec@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that will be shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to le@@ ak her and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies in film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 associated 84 percent of all respon@@ dents mil@@ in bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain included lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ ec@@ y with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they had terror@@ ized her neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from its estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
once they were removed from their property , shocked by the flat co@@ operatives , the property found in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls exp@@ elled holes on , wood di@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family were killed and it is believed that now she lives in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ o@@ y , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is also available .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment , and the police said that the terror that inf@@ licted the family , stre@@ amed with Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ists , in@@ timi@@ dated by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking , and excessive scre@@ ams , exten@@ ders and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house which under certain circumstances be demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
they were tra@@ ded in the property where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past .
neighbours said they had to fight them on the streets and regularly had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner this week by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung have been ex@@ iled by ligh@@ tened neighbors , saying that her life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She sm@@ elled not anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
the numerous times that we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not accustomed to !
now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
at the over@@ grown side of the communal house were thrown down garbage and old toys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ ity is always the last step to take into consideration Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case because the behavior was extremely and what their neighbours had to be terrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the Municipality which were brave to us and have provided us the information they have made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will be a couple of neighbours in con@@ sol@@ ation and conve@@ ys the message that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all be about 20 .
a dirty mattress that left behind the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ ines .
the workers of the household management are now to be du@@ b@@ ish near the house , which surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ al@@ ies and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received an excuse after she was found guilty of the owner of a drug of class B in commercial control .
she said that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , which came to life in 2013 at a car accident .
after being without the shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many carp@@ enters of the house were scr@@ apped with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be ten@@ ant at ten@@ ant who do not hold to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ val is a clear warning to the other tenants which do not hold onto the home order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ation as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

a portu@@ g@@ is@@ i@@ es@@ ian P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft of air forces put an incredible storm @-@ flight
the air forces gave that it was on a training flight , but insisted that no safety risk was stopped
this was the moment when the scar@@ ed tourists start to panic after a ti@@ phe@@ as@@ hing jet over a full beach cr@@ ashes .
dramatic video recordings showed , like the military aircraft almost in reaching proximity of the sun@@ spots on the beach @-@ section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers turned out , when they in@@ closed , understand@@ ably , worry about the noise of the dense mines , without seeing what is coming through the clouds on them .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who took the videos of the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall off . &quot;
N@@ uno arrogan@@ ce said : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down upon me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were into panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft on a training trip was found to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep flying that this was the only way to recognize it .
the spokes@@ man said that the jet is somewhat lower than usual in the vicinity of the bad surface area . however , the air forces insisted that safety at any time was at risk .
Fle@@ mish br@@ aces have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke - so deeply to fly , which limits his point of view
the plane was located on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise

Ma Long in its own league for table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis rac@@ e@@ ger .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old sealed on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unilater@@ al finale to his Land@@ smann and &quot; tit@@ le@@ holder &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.4 : 4 ) .
with this , the World Cup first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ ar@@ nier and Olympia .
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected in the game play and they made the title among each other .
so it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the sets and on time @-@ outs , they had no coaches on their own .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their sw@@ ings in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches up here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the finals , I play for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had said Z@@ hang out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the parti@@ te gold and silver medal in the China flag .
the match itself was unexpected one @-@ sided .
Ma had only to fight with his 28 @-@ year opponent only in the first sentence .
then he set the pace on the plate and left the slope there only a total of 13 points .
the superiority of Ma &apos;@@ at was not the expected match .
however , there were nonetheless enough breath @-@ taking changes to see .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
the white rus@@ sian had turned out in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Championship Dimit@@ ri@@ j ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , a ri@@ ppen@@ violation , was then in medical treatment , had to settle for &quot; ultimately &quot; with sheet metal .
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were also similar to a high @-@ table tennis Olympics .
Donald Tr@@ ump S@@ t ″ tremendous problems ... in the election campaign
the leadership of the U.S. re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative federal states .
presidential did@@ ate Donald Tr@@ ump gave weaknesses of its election campaign in the current Republi@@ can high@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually big @-@ gau@@ ge and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed as something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents reported .
after finishing 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp , has thrown out of the race , are now growing the doubts about his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia .
to blame false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took back his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can high@@ bur@@ ns w@@ ack@@ eln
Utah is usually a secure bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
a survey of Surve@@ y@@ USA from June according to Tr@@ ump and his con@@ notation of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equ@@ als .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance , which are common to the Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
at risk , Arizona and Georgia are considered to be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ BC &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Tr@@ ump answered the question how to stop the rise of Clin@@ ics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you leave : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
if there is no need for him in the end for reasons of political correctness , be this in order , said Tr@@ ump continued .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the press , the party Tr@@ ump should have threatened with money to support his election campaign , he should not present a better change .
instead of pursuing the candidates of re@@ public@@ ans for Congress stronger among the arms .
Olympia : tri@@ ister fraud on D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission to the case .
Ken@@ ias L@@ eich@@ ta@@ d is threatened after the second D@@ oping aff@@ aires at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a bed @-@ test attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach to the home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with , immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former Spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , was given a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ runners F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch .
this is the team leader in Kenya by the D@@ oping Contro@@ llers .
the World association IA@@ AF has the IO@@ C in order to disclose information about the case to strict investigations , shared an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping Control station and signed up as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , the sample was released and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Ken@@ ias Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credi@@ ting of athletes , who stood on the list for the training controls in the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch was 2015 in Beijing World Cup @-@ Vier@@ ter over 800 metres .
four days before the Ken@@ yan L@@ eich@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics delegation from Rio Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio @-@ Play .
he is supposed to be informed against cash payments of his country on upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reporting , he said to be arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya is at the IO@@ C after numerous D@@ oping agreements have been under special observation since a long time .
at the announcement of the IO@@ C set out more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls before the Rio Games , it was usually pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the sight .
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before Olympia start .
in the episode the W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose ac@@ oping fight against the rules of the W@@ ada are .
Kenya is regarded as a major runner nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
in a series of television report of the ARD , there were always alleg@@ ations that in Kenya are easily accessible and there is a considerable mentality of sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und finally asked a similar investigation in Kenya as he asked them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport area @-@ covers and systematically recorded .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics have subsequently been excluded from the summer .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , like Romeo and Ju@@ lie@@ t .
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein masterpiece .
the artistic leader Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in orches@@ tr@@ al the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ onal@@ conduc@@ tors Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ stein music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays a older Lady .
she reminds yourself of her love to her beloved with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is wise , of course also naive , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character I wrote as Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an extremely powerful man .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
prevention is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the American film@@ maker Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have gone to the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tor@@ icans have gone to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
these are the same topics , and they are just as powerful today as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that itself takes refugees in its own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deputy chief compl@@ ained the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic towns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus Erdogan wants to increase the export pressure on the remaining Kurds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or displaced over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , which is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the President called for the federal government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany I find a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdogan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement also feared the flight of many Turks to foreign countries .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ mar@@ cation as Gü@@ len @-@ pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who does not fit and Erdogan is sitting on packed bags , incidentally also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reported on appeal to numbers of the Federal Republic of the Federal Republic of the Federal Republic , the Turks created the largest group in Germany because of political persecution recognized asylum in Germany .
for the date of 30 June , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all as asylum entitled ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey you will not find the war , poverty or the fu@@ tility of spirits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state of government , individually followed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2005 , the elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the heav@@ y@@ ance of the parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
because stupid as hitherto it is not : summer holidays , heat and plant@@ ation struggle - that is attached .
the locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country are on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not native , so they are not allowed to choose land@@ day .
these are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters infl@@ ate , air balloon infl@@ atable , fl@@ yers and count on the end of the vote only fatigue .
until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and last holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over themselves by the people in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
the hot phase if you can say that , has just begun .
and there is also something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of the SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office .
the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now located in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end Ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ dust .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Govern@@ ors , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees by its big pl@@ ough@@ s .
he travels through land , distributed ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did already his legendary horse @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff .
otherwise he has got seaf@@ aring @-@ old feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame on the b@@ los@@ som@@ ing of the African D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your refugee policy , your &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rise of the right @-@ wing popul@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will probably cost him the beautiful position now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with her peak candidate , the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced how it is , if you are at the wrong time at the right place of voting .
she has invited twice the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major documents ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag lies in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority of other Länder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is a pity , too from the other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U is largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usual election &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market areas and shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that , so Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the Union has noted that you must cut the base on the land that it has to be very strict , to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the expan@@ se of the country barely exists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campa@@ igning to his collaborators , however , is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is standing on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called for a particularly committed electoral campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats also last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and only just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 the SPD had won clearly with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should create the leap in the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue from the holidays , and ver@@ ted their constitu@@ ent in the first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the provincial Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise the green fighter @-@ fighters on column search for local stim@@ ulates among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t with a house boat by the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ bur@@ ian lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tions in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : Gast@@ ons suffer from blocking
at the speed , with which the B 27 is re@@ habilit@@ ated , there is nothing to complain about .
the those responsible for those who are responsible at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end up until twenty o &apos;clock in the morning , there is absolutely no praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no de@@ duction .
the construction site was scheduled to be moved on the weekly basis for the half time as planned , until the end of October everything will be ready .
praised will also be the dis@@ agreement of those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of man@@ hel@@ ds .
since the construction site on Monday to South S@@ ander@@ ed and also the block of the Asp@@ erg@@ burg is lifted in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is restored , the traffic situation in the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now rely on the B 27 again from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen .
the rest of traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy chief executive director of Florian King for the commercial management of Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sc@@ aff@@ ways were sought and rather familiar their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age .
what led to the fact that some lor@@ ries in residential areas led themselves .
as the speed limit is not observed , the community called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was considerable over@@ lap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself about the situation even on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the road with 77 hour @-@ kilometers at the speed @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site is continued , but it has become more quiet .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
in the cards they do not like to look .
but that the B 27 @-@ Rehabilitation with them has led to turnover increase , lets each one ask us to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the refurbis@@ hment has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also a thing of course is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bou@@ levard are the edge along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not just him , but all the hosts have made it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we must be glad about every euro turnover .
the sales revenue amoun@@ ted to over 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road marking has thrown its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the note answered , the Gast@@ stätte benefited otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 Now they also need the disadvantages , which surrender itself through the refurbis@@ hment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where something was treated with funding .
with all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest will continue to pers@@ ist .
after all , the family run has been here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other tribal guests are now able to pass less frequently due to complicated traffic conditions , it can be understood .
if you can not drive , it is also elsewhere beautiful .
the fact that his tribal climate after the end of the re@@ organisation will come back , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and Vogel@@ gri@@ ppe G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the impact of the B 27 construction work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its guest place in its long @-@ term history .
six months construction work , which is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now sets a thick security package .
but what has a gas@@ p status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ er@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new security packages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are asking for anyone .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in this , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Interior Minister , he is situated on results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach where he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
some is already known , announced that a new security authority to take care of the co@@ ke co@@ ded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany needs to apply several EU guidelines to air@@ fare and weapons rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for safety authorities is not surprising .
in part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt on proposals made with the SPD so far : he wants to face sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and cr@@ abs the German passport with dual citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he still hold this for reasonable and demanding nothing , which at any rate have no opportunities at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er .
a few new ideas presents the Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are partly in itself : he plans spe@@ edy processes for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ tain@@ ement of people before deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted in the country should let their smartphone check @-@ in and disclose social media accounts for a safety review . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for distr@@ actions for distr@@ acted asylum seekers he wants to place some even worse than so far - about such a criminal off@@ ences or throw their papers to de@@ pose their identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them is political and legally sanc@@ tified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ ches also works un@@ pronounced and leaves questions open .
and at some points - in the imbalance of memory for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it does not address in speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees were .
furthermore , many people in the face of the high refugee camps have worried about safety .
and things that are deeply concerned people , have not settled in the election times even in election periods .
the inner security is huge in the focus .
only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the temp@@ ting is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , there are elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Union and the SPD is therefore increasingly becoming a position on the issue of internal security . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days there was a high degree between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ment dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of Uni@@ ons , in which the res@@ umes also ask a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also going to be a conc@@ il@@ able sound .
from a return from the double pass he does not hold anything .
we met the discussion in Germany .
they are re@@ plen@@ ished , be not sensible .
and with a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban he have constitutional concerns .
whether his own package is constitu@@ ent to all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ er , only needs to be revealed .
there is a lot of things that could cause for dispute .
but the SPD is also trying to take advantage of internal security .
Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled once more careful conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot;
even comes Volkswagen glimp@@ ses through .
despite diesel models , the delivery fees are rising worldwide .
but not in all markets it runs around .
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen starts the shipment to the second half of the year .
Europe &apos;s biggest bus systems can continue to advance a plus in the previous year , despite the diesel , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ going markets .
but in July weak@@ ened the core brand VW , especially in Western Europe , and loaded with it again the total res@@ ale as that was noted in the D@@ ax company .
in the world , the VW is sold in July by 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales rose 14 percent below the previous year @-@ in @-@ year .
at the home market , Germany s@@ ack@@ ted the ex@@ tradition of nearly one h@@ exag@@ ons .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann was leading the weaker figures from July above all to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it has been given in some nuclear markets by &quot; changing economic framework . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey also the British vote was de@@ bit@@ ed from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the gas@@ kets first escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
in total , the mainly affected domestic trademark of the Lower Saxony is still further glimp@@ sed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months only an ex@@ tradition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Group Leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Group Kap@@ pl@@ ers could continue to report a sales split from January to July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1,3 per cent more cars supplied Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had manip@@ ulated with a software subscription .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for re@@ armament to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW is that the re@@ building of the cars has no negative effects .
after re@@ armament of the vehicles , there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the drive from the client after re@@ armament is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee for reco@@ vering diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have confirmed the last Monday VW Represent@@ atives in the Federal Ministry of Department . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the traffic Department has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the conditions of my investigation commission and KBA to be fulfilled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor performance after re@@ armament do not take any deterior@@ ations and have unchanged all typical authorized vehicle values unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the vast term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers can come in a workshop for example a half year after re@@ armament , and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there are any other damage with any other damage caused by the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ c@@ andal , to a uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations , as it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW is not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund is on the Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see demands from rich savers in the future as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank@@ manager Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is only about 139 customer , the 40 million Euro on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daytime accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German associated German banks speaks of an individual and does not see a signal in it : normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would not be afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ ny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
storing banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge requires the ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients to deposits over 100,000 Euro to Gi@@ ro@@ - or daytime accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been around 40 million euros for a long time , which could be withdrawn from one day to another , and which he cannot fail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those are lying with me in the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can not lie for each million 4000 Euros &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he continued the cost after the pol@@ lu@@ de principle .
the cash simply lie in the Tres@@ hold of the ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four over@@ s , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the banker .
most customers would have understanding and rarely appear on other assets .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operatives of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you alone to wear , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore raised their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers .
with offen@@ ding for deposits of three million euros the Thur@@ in@@ gian and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with their skating bench branch in 2014 .
Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay a wide basis for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see , I give &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a climate , which has a bit lush from the property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 @-@ founded cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ operatives of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently not well @-@ known , which will charge a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich had explained : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives with the private clients , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard , and it dro@@ ves the migration of investors to the competition .

the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I was probably something to be young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who are buying the plates , more intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and have prompted themselves to buy their old records again .
from the talks I have led , people usually have escaped their collection in 1998 or in 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of trailers of the disk of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that records are a soothing community of in@@ ges@@ tures .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record @-@ fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ plates , from objects , the happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of materi@@ alistic possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z .
this is for me as collectors , and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to engage spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes an employee from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , they have not yet been heard .
the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player , which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player .
at that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I stro@@ ked by a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the reaction .
&quot; someone came only recently here and said , &quot; I do not own record player , but I would like to buy a radio head record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it happens definitely .
more product @-@ glass , less musical .
we have people who say : &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
these are younger people , not older , who only come slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has a sound hand dedicated almost a whole floor , has a blu@@ ff audience when I was going to puri@@ fy .
there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ age@@ j@@ ungs and women middle aged .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the preceding shops - Wild Be@@ asts New synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ c@@ un@@ ter pop instead of experimental jazz are reconc@@ iled from loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them look quite lonely , but wet mental trau@@ mas are hard to be imagined if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in the business for several minutes and regards the var@@ ie@@ ty of the available plates .
it is more like a man@@ nequ@@ in than a large purchase .
it doesn &apos;t earn much , therefore the collecting of records is not a real option , says it .
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer or another way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives with a lovely si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a store by which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the case , the je@@ ans @-@ hot@@ spots , I watched a group of young teenagers who are group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley turn@@ tables .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that gives most of the luxury items such as plates .
even though my tut@@ orials took place , that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , let them at least in record business in Soho , the large number of female collectors and records who exist in reality , disco@@ vers and in online for@@ en@@ cia .
these people probably work hard at school or office .
they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with stro@@ lling through record stores of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they avoid the rigid look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year old moder@@ ator , that rises over the shoulders of none of the middle aged men .

French Court re@@ jects special offer about demo@@ li@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camps .
a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a court proceedings this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be be@@ authorised to sell 72 provisional transactions in which individuals outside the bearing goods , sell , hair@@ dressing services offer or tea for 50 cents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a couple of euros in provisional e@@ ater@@ ies .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture was argu@@ ing that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and who are a fire@@ wall and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups split the dish that businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in stock .
they went out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional transactions , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fec@@ tural pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais &quot; are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than just to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
one of the places , which was threatened by the down@@ fall , the vir@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , the shared kitchen is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to maintain the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be disastrous in which the recent eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migran@@ ts honored on Friday that the number of people in the jungle camp had risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals during the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed : in different federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der should be particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic development En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at accident levels , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example on highway building or to sandy bridges with temporary temporary , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit for the speed of speed .
a durable mobili@@ zation can however be too dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser technology allows all vehicles to be captured over several tracks across the same time .
variable speed limit and access to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the high @-@ prop@@ elled condition one can move the pend@@ ant according to manufacturers with each car with tags .
so that he is not easy to use , it is lo@@ wered in measuring , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear .
furthermore , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer from V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer for details of Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal states and is now also used .
also foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technique : younger has made France 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain Br@@ ing silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by , after Fiji and class gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated here in Rio .
Fiji issued a master class in the handling , side @-@ stepping , after@@ math , line run and ro@@ her force to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color .
the defeat was vers@@ ed by the not so bad Tro@@ st@@ Award of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals .
but irrespective of it , Fiji on this form had a 15 @-@ man team in a funer@@ al form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former Chief for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost under Ry@@ an every game with Adel@@ ai@@ de Se@@ vens .
here they lost only one .
this strap is going to do , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji began wonderful and allowed the attacks G@@ b@@ S from fun exhau@@ sting .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wai also added another attack from the right corner , which he turned over .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly pronounced the ball .
an excellent t@@ resses of Mitchell never stops the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it has Fiji on Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ trial and there was still over a minute season ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ided by another weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed to line to make a gate .
the conversion took an 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
it is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 , while GB still da@@ er@@ ated .
so it is also .
GB was introduced basic changes to the half time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half period , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran out after a brilliant stop@@ play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the South Caucasus , whose fans s@@ angen , Flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame continued the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the p@@ fi@@ ff er@@ ts , the Fi@@ j@@ is um@@ arm@@ ten and GB k@@ ic@@ ked laid down in the lawn .
earlier in the day , Fiji Japan was defeated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain urged South Africa in a cris@@ p half @-@ final match of the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ ing and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant surprise , Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , secured profits - and thus the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning by fighting with the Cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than in those games and that wants to be .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ie@@ ve that enter the story , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their gol@@ den@@ em moment on the Est@@ onian da Lag@@ oa .
even though it was only the Bei@@ den who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ ot@@ ted when she filed for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a tax maid , the first women in the history of British Sports , which showed such a scale .
your domin@@ ance was absolute , after all its 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ written application , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ os who gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph@@ al .
behind every gold in the Ru@@ ins , a bat@@ tal@@ ion will contribute to wild advances which make the difference and it was no one assistant as the trainer who was not able to survive this day when cancer was diagnosed at all .
as he said he was risky .
I had bladder cancer , who is oper@@ able and that did they do .
if you do not , it spreads everywhere from .
it would have been a rather horrible situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was treatment early 2014 , out of season , could start what the interruption occurred to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the in@@ trac@@ e@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ free morning to talk something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
p@@ anning that was as captain in the Royal Ar@@ till@@ ery Regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
it just repeated how much I mean how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive boy goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no races lost in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had joined , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a great deal in reserve .
we were very at the moment caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really is important to not be able to rip off .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make some Tol@@ les .
we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did too .
the pair will take a time out for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ ur@@ ers Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that could have been too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to comprehend that I am a Olympics .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years advanced for clarity
the managing director of the water @-@ purpose network &quot; V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ active drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
it was for some time ago in the original version of the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken said the Second @-@ association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stein@@ bracket &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as pre @-@ exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

member communities are the communities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach .
for further cities and municipalities there are water deliveries .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ t Citi@@ zen@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Elec@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was set up as a water@@ wart and was already appointed Managing Director of the Second International Association .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they have been extended from the water conduc@@ tion and maintenance work on office and organizational skills , the budget creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency actions on weekends , &quot; said the Chair@@ woman .
as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restructuring of the container ( 1999 ) , the creation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divisions of water lines .
there have been no stagn@@ ant and I have always added any new additions because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , they praised i@@ llers , reliable and correct service over 31 years away .
he has worked with a great heart of heart for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived with the water @-@ purpose association , as if it would be its own business .
a few weeks ago , he as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ en@@ stone group to the nit@@ rate tree in front of the water forum of the District .
he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on the one hand lob@@ te , Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked together with him for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ wart and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
the highlights from his point of view he indicated the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re @-@ structure of the Second @-@ Association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pipes on the high@@ container at the high@@ lands on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the places with water could be supplied .
even the supply of Neu@@ brunn one can only be maintained because one filled the vessels of P@@ ett@@ stadt with drag@@ ons .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was passed to Daniel storms from lou@@ der , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called to us and stated his CV , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ book . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the escape , according to him will be the public eye .

the police speaks of a &quot; relationship &quot; . &quot;
the victim is year 1988 , the perpetrators of 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any information on the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between the perpetrators and victims ; but confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a pottery deli@@ rium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we are not saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a poli@@ cem@@ an in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cr@@ isen@@ ge@@ beut@@ ler and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial stress which thre@@ aten the industry from the ec@@ lip@@ se promotion , are from the table .
it remains with the liberation of renewable energy sources for regular current @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Fre@@ edi@@ an issue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could finally reach the tough negotiation after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was initially planned to request the steel manufacturers , the gases from the ho@@ v to generate electricity for their own consumption .
the steel industry had additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry sector .
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , I now give an agreement with the European Commission to talks with competition Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel plants will be replaced , all an E@@ EG col@@ lage form 20 percent .
but also this is not raised in steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the European Commission for its own stream .
this means that the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stahl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be considered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from capacities and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation continues to increase as the world &apos;s largest producer China in view of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand mass @-@ steel steel on the world market .
European manufacturers raise Chinese steel concerts @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand the import duties on the import st@@ ole effect , on the other hand , the economic prospects have been enligh@@ tened in China .
unclear how sustainable the price is reco@@ vering .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices had to be stagn@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to not exclude the closing of individual works .
in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 around 8@@ 6000 people were employed .
in July , German steel manufacturers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced 3.4 million tons of good 6 percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s figure , including the steel @-@ association steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the her@@ ed quantity went back again the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is counting in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing boost . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community , spirit , health : singing is good
the S@@ ingen @-@ UR@@ SE@@ L K@@ ip@@ p has accompanied her whole life : as young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher studies , she cap@@ ed the thread of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and a whole more lively , she tells .
in doing so , they do something good with their health and spirit .
for S@@ ingen is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard Hac@@ kler from the German seniors liga .
most sen@@ sing singers in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the pleasure of music , describes Hac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , senior can establish social contacts and cultivate them .
because often social and family structures solve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L K@@ ip@@ p in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come and organize themselves to be able to rely on the other and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says Hac@@ kler .
for doing so , seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who are calling its lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible .
even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft für seniors .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs among older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and especially melodies , themselves deny themselves the sick people in long back events .
at S@@ ingen the head is also called for special achievement , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone , practice so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that you learn by the S@@ ingen in the choir , says Hac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I am long for something , I will get better and watch@@ ful about me - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start with singing , there is so enough .
those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , betra@@ ying l@@ enz .
you do not sing alone - at least 50 singing people , who will hear when a sound goes off to it ?
in the search of the suitable offer , seniors have different possibilities , says Hac@@ kler .
sing someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior ench@@ y@@ ma , you can simply join .
many towns also offer insights on the choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many senior ench@@ ant@@ ors can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who does not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors will ask for help with interfer@@ ing .
who desire has to sing should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ y Hac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something fre@@ eing - this applies to any age .
cats react sensitive as a cat on scre@@ ams of the kittens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the Ru@@ ins of Katzen@@ bab@@ ys has grown up to adult animals .
at her surprise , the mi@@ a@@ ys also did not allow the males to be cold - but they kept in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the occurrence of cat @-@ bab@@ ys on the mi@@ ath of the little ones .
they respond to ten percent faster to get rid of kittens who have found themselves in great hard@@ ship , such as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University Hanover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also respond to the herds of kittens but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ tigation of less and strongly inherited p@@ ups are either in@@ percep@@ tible , or not of meaning , &quot; said the Biolog@@ o Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first authorised in the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a previous study the research team had already found out that the duration and sound level of the kittens with the urgency of their help is different .
in total , nine adult ger@@ ater and eight females have been observed from the fe@@ asi@@ bility of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a row of babies which were taken for three minutes from the throw @-@ box and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kittens that have additionally been raised up .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turned out faster to loud@@ speakers when this jer@@ king played the very exhau@@ sting kittens .
this ability may be connected or develop@@ ped out with the genital mat@@ uring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have responded to all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Biolog@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men in the past several times in the past .
also some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to mammals around whether they were already mothers or not , the Biolog@@ o Marina Sche@@ um .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a soccer legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the erst@@ while football star of Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r , a arrest warran@@ t was en@@ acted .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey there is another important football match .
in front of the du@@ el of the patriarch@@ al between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already at the suspension of the exception , after the crash test in July , the government , the everyday life of standardization would not be affected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len that is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , even before football is not done .
against the previous Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver the prosec@@ utor presented an arrest warran@@ t .
according to this , the South Africa in America will be accused of being in the Americas , to be a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ver should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for Putin &apos;s attempt by president Rec@@ ep Tayy@@ ip Erdogan .
although initially for 90 days it is valid for 90 days until October , in fact that on the lives of most Turks it has as good as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the next time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdogan declared on Wednesday for termin@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - as the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdogan .
the fans of the workers &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks has united in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ sie@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions completed the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NAT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his crew to the tro@@ phy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ missed season for the record master a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; also hit the &quot; lions &quot; also in the Europe League early .
in the South by L@@ ig , it was only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this we have made and that is the most important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ tas the game was better .
especially thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who with 26 seasonal figures as South @-@ L@@ ig @-@ go@@ al@@ could put the base of the 14th title .
that is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year @-@ old .
in doing so , at the AC Florence , the G@@ ome@@ z was only announced , after the coup attempt was announced , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario yet wants to come to us , he must say it only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expert magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ icker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club@@ boss F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the falls would be ready to rel@@ inqu@@ ish about a third of its to 7.5 million euros valued vin@@ tages , and asked Or@@ man clear : &quot; his salary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have yet medals @-@ chances in Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Ste@@ pan@@ owa must not start in Rio .
other over@@ led athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh it - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is determined by the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had beha@@ ved off after a dop@@ ing block their start right shortly before the games , was mer@@ ed in its start ( 100 meters chest ) gn@@ ess and hidden .
it offered a sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenario : with a set @-@ up smile she was still proud into the hall and prov@@ okes with her appearance .
when certain that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ storm .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite di@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since his spell the Olympi@@ asi@@ ger from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ minute Olympics in 2010 had to sit down a six @-@ month lock after taking the pain of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation they had a powerful tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympics was tested by 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 .
per@@ kovic climbed the wis@@ er intake and was locked six months .
the four widest throws in this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ ger and two mal@@ aker over 400 m , 2010 was positively tested and 21 months blocked .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , di@@ demon@@ ed Mer@@ ano .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably barely one athletes have been thou@@ ght@@ fully recognized as many medals .
so Ty@@ chy lost his World Cup title in 2005 nine years later , after having found testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to also leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ Dop@@ ings and the EM @-@ title of 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the well @-@ recognized Bron@@ z@@ eme@@ da@@ ille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was given back on account of a pri@@ eve of the International Sport@@ s@@ jurisdiction CA@@ S .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world leader and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was first tested in May , but can still start in Rio .
the 29 year old world championship in were found evidence of taking a bot@@ tled supplement found by blocking the lock of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada and ran already on July 13 .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austria is injured - multi@@ ere t@@ ote
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday early .
they have suffered car@@ vers and have been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again .
she is planning her home trip for early September .
whether from further explo@@ sions on the holidays of Ph@@ u@@ ket , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also affects Austrian citizens , be not yet unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , so sn@@ ags .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ Hua H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in a walk @-@ out of two bombs .
according to police , the police were killed and about 20 people have been wounded , including the Austrian , three German , three low@@ lands and three Italians .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sives went high , so according to the authorities a further person was killed .
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning a bombing has been reported .
in the de@@ ton@@ ation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was hurt by police officers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bomb that k@@ ills a city set .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives was gone to the air according to the authorities in a flo@@ wer@@ be@@ et before the Re@@ four of the coastal police .
finally , de@@ ton@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the southeast coast several Ver@@ sions .
in connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attack carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said armies e@@ general Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee on Friday early in front of journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express themselves on potential motives - probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels .
the Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern during the attacks , which is typical for the bomb of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , explained the attacks in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just local sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities would have received secrecy in the past few days of secret evidence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police declared their officials in the whole country , the security of important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and am@@ use@@ ment district .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attack , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the well @-@ known bom@@ bers , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends a consequence to its homepage , the instructions of Thai security authorities .
high safety risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ olin and surroundings .
according to disputes between security guards and Muslim population , there will be no necessary journeys into these provinces not necessary .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) laid for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday spent few days after a controversial referendum held on one by the military jun@@ ta .
the military has a great influence over the coming years in the coming years .
Jun@@ ta &apos;s boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ fy chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military jun@@ ta , who had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , considers itself to be a good one to re @-@ led the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military has not succeeded in getting the Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
a few years ago in Bangkok , a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people had been killed in Bangkok , most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody tip of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is advised in the Vis@@ itor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial offices , the Constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspirations against the freedom of democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief , Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigration of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way .
therefore , we are monitoring the movement too .
the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tic@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by overseas &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Lower Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ he said , his authority was closely aligned with the offices in their decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally speaking extremis@@ ts , speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the communist Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is no bed@@ time advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should address people emo@@ tionally .
young people are particularly vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; recently it had given reports of several federal states on contacts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ he said , he did not have knowledge .
in a certain point of constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species be relevant only from a certain point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain persons , the extrem@@ ist , changes its target area and is extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist .
the key factors whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase of illegal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee information , Ma@@ he said , he would not speak again in this context of new right terrorism .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be ri@@ fu@@ istic structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ day@@ group .
it can be quite true that more lawful group@@ ings or small groups form to form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ ving or attack on other extreme @-@ right motives .
however , a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of leg@@ ality is not recognizable .
the previous groups were developed at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned , Ma@@ did have expressed concern that many transi@@ tions went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the worrying .
many of the Tat@@ suspic@@ iously at asylum seekers have not been known as criminals , politically motivated , or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed criminal off@@ ences before they had previously worked with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who might have been politically in@@ different or have elected to the CD@@ U , SPD or left , but they have radic@@ alised the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ wing mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : ROB@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the Olymp@@ ion@@ icles or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous presence of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ at during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly superior swi@@ mm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that it was no longer able to see in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return of 48 seconds ended his pre @-@ run and captured the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just a sporty figure that attracted attention from the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old will take part in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in backward countries more known .
because in Ethiopia most sports@@ men want to run , he simply wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : ROB@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname of the round made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media recorded him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to a &quot; Well @-@ wearing &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard &quot; The Sun , &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him funny .
his time , he proposed only a minute and almost five seconds over 100 metres of Fre@@ est@@ an , he played there no role .
&quot; &quot; &quot; comparisons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters free alone .
f@@ rene@@ tic was in@@ timi@@ zed at that time .
at the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old he had to swim eight months before Olympia and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

post climb@@ s into the trade with electric transport
an electro @-@ commercial vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the plumage is obviously great .
the post office is planning to sell their electro@@ vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oters .
in the nut@@ shell , the Group will start the trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the post will also want to offer its electro @-@ transpor@@ ter from the coming year on the free machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to a third party , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ person on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been constantly audi@@ ted for months whether they are to be delivered to their own stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with letters and pop@@ lar , also to sell to other farms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very sturdy step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we place the complete fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active in Germany since 2014 .
G@@ FR@@ P &apos;s Leadership to dis@@ appoint business numbers
the consumer research company Gf@@ K operated by Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the rear @-@ cuts came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the Gf@@ K business publishing company Gf@@ K allowed , that the chair of pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ists Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the promised success remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nür@@ n@@ berger Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after re@@ dis@@ appoint business numbers and the resignation of the company leadership , the global number five of the industry is faced with a personalized new beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P leader wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already pushed out of the super@@ visory body with effect from 12 September .
for September 1 , the management board will take over the previous board member with Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , shared the company .
he is officially supposed to take on the function of a &quot; CEO , &quot; until a successor was found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ tr@@ ance , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to call an enterprise speaker on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be le@@ ased the market research in the future is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in An@@ le@@ ger@@ orbit it was on Friday , at the shareholders , last but the disappointment about the continued success of the years ago been initiated .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K business numbers , each shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; if this would be the case at BMW , this would also be the Qu@@ and@@ ts , &quot; says it .
in the second quarter of 2016 , the company had not been able to stop its losses in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.@@ 1 per cent below the level of the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in reference to the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros was 3.4 per cent by 3.4 per cent .
in the second quarter the profit of the company has been neg@@ atively affected by the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
in the business of Consumer Experience , the company &apos;s assets of € 139 achieved a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros .
Gf@@ K generated a consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus slides in Kar@@ ron@@ n in dit@@ ch : eight injured
at an accident of a coach with 43 Sen@@ iors I have been injured on Thursday in Kar@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( Land@@ circle Aur@@ i ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries the police dealt with .
the 66 year old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade its details according to a counter@@ ing le@@ aster , which was partly driving on the road track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ i / Witt@@ mund was reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said they said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire@@ men are liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ance cars and an emergency cars came to the accident at the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ last travellers were brought back to the Kar@@ ws@@ av@@ ner district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators demanded the trucks and potential witnesses to get in touch with the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters of wast@@ e@@ water will amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Which beach 3,@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be reduced later when corresponding improvement measures will be necessary .
after a covered calculation , the se@@ wage rates in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was found during the approval of the budget through the Kul@@ mb@@ ach County , that this se@@ wage systems are over@@ hau@@ led .
the market cas@@ endorf is committed to the legal basis , to operate the systems cost @-@ covered .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and commercial and industrial companies are from the worlds of Wel@@ ding , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg deeper into the wal@@ let .
the u@@ bi@@ dding lie between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman manager Herbert Schmidt showed the body of the committee , a new circulation of fees for se@@ wage systems were necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 remains over@@ - and under@@ mines from the previous cal@@ ender period .
the engra@@ ving u@@ pris@@ ings founded Schmidt that it is with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small @-@ se@@ wage systems with a very low waste water , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic metres per year .
as a result of the small distribution base , for instance , would have a serious impact on the necessary repairs of several thousand euros .
also , the se@@ wage drift in all three systems is slightly declin@@ ing .
furthermore , the down@@ stream period in all three systems were not least incurred due to its age - and repar@@ ations in a considerable extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for the worlds , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
in the p@@ umping station , the nearly 20 years old feed plants had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and at the pond water Lop@@ p had to be excav@@ ated after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ en , the cl@@ ums@@ y spon@@ ge and will be able to respect the water @-@ legal requirements even in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too these extraordinary expenses came the advanced tut@@ or and maintenance costs , which are to be considered in accordance with the new financial period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 are still significantly below the current level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he added Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious after view of stone houses , especially as one could not extend the supply of the san@@ itation of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these plants , because it is dedicated to de@@ frag@@ mented bodies .
Bulgaria ins@@ ed inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was in July 1 % on a monthly basis .

the annual average stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the price @-@ price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % .

Sn@@ ap@@ shots &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as asi@@ an caric@@ ature has been critici@@ zed
sn@@ ap@@ shots says that this filter is inspired , but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ bel against breeds .
with its fil@@ tering tool it enables sn@@ ap@@ shots around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure , which could be of a Roy Lich@@ ten@@ stein paintings .
the filters are un@@ blo@@ ated , unique tools that generate more than 30 million improved Sel@@ ected per day .
all mis@@ steps will reach the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filter have drawn criticism in the past , in which they have been accused of having the app of Black@@ face counter@@ ing or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed a filter for some U@@ sers , who gave them sle@@ ep@@ tive , false teeth and uns@@ us@@ hed che@@ eks , there were some critics of a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ates - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot;
you asked yourself whether this repeated controversy is on a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and the indign@@ ation were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after sn@@ ap@@ shots , that it would have been de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ates .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experience rac@@ is@@ sm , reminded of the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
other declined to the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail she wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , an Korean American artistic student , whose t@@ we@@ et were widespread over the photos , that the filter was hur@@ t@@ ful and mild to say uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not stored @-@ assured , but that the yel@@ lowing was drawn into the ab@@ ent@@ ant extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ shots is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration support , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the matter of race as their older counterparts - could rather be expected to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats fil@@ tering a picture creates that for a user , it is much harder that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided to work as a product man@@ ag@@ ger and an engineering in the medium , you have to delete sn@@ ap@@ chat account for others to do the same .
in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that r@@ ust @-@ related inspec@@ tions reflect a lack of diversity in the inser@@ tion practices at Sn@@ ap@@ shots .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed that for the large part white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Dele@@ te Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ shots mostly left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish any figures concerning the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , there were Sn@@ ap@@ shots , to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company recently focused on a human resources dedicated to supporting population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Zh@@ u told her that she is closed their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
military leadership ver@@ fold ISIS &apos; intelligence information , presents Committee of Congress
military member of the United States Central Command Pro@@ sec@@ tional information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islam@@ ische State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual state @-@ states on the spot , presented a preliminary committee of Congress in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces , Secret Doc@@ tor and the Wehr@@ macht , reports of great dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ment amongst Central Command Intelligence services , reported on how pro@@ vision@@ ing their estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State changed .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news of information collected from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ uren , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perio@@ dically sent a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual state of states on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of Represent@@ atives &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
management abnorm@@ alities in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows a detailed report in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces .
although there is no direct reference there@@ on that government tips are given to Obama to change reports , as analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure from their laws , an optimistic picture from the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , opinions and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts identified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com has been publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can convention from K@@ ans@@ as , in one opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the initial reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ can cried the Task Force to life after it has been played , analy@@ st concerns about manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed knowledge and will be continued during investigations .
additional investigations by Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Assembly of the Ministry of Defence .
democratic members of the news service published on Thursday released their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for creating re@@ plac@@ ements of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest democr@@ at Council gave him to the Com@@ mit Tea , Member of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed the morality among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave over@@ ly little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats have given no evidence of an intervention by the White House in the Cent@@ Com analy@@ st on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain political opinion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported in investigations by the general spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were admitted to complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press spokes@@ person from the Pentagon , gave in a opinion that the Ministry of Defence did not comment any reports of Congress while investig@@ ating the inspec@@ tors still in progress .
but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
investig@@ ating investigations on the issue of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question to the extent that President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest inv@@ itations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information on the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the former government under George W. Bush wrote only a little occupying forces in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker asks Mr. Hoo@@ ker to submit any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group Raff@@ iner@@ tia would have had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries were put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market .
but this knowledge was not published , however , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger command , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legis@@ lature because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the warfare in a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Britain stands before
one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American @-@ ended with 3 @-@ 0 won .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , that knows them : the American @-@ ups are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place that after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group will reach the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ seat is going to walk a bit longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
whatever the game starts on Saturday , the American people have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed in the last London games on the last of 12 seats .
B@@ AM was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 , in which for her and her team went all wrong .
in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham became an Englis@@ h@@ man , a trainer of the National Team , and thus the things began to better turn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have the helm to be completely ro@@ mp@@ ed .
on Thursday night , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a withdrawal from the clo@@ ak area .
India had gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team turned out surprisingly tough and kept the game of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a Sprint with the shallow ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and swal@@ lowed the ball into the gate around the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 tour .
Mel@@ issa Gonzal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on Saturday the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ins
wherever you are , how late it is also , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are developing consistently and inevitably , a fast season between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning st@@ ab , which is irrit@@ ated from the brac@@ elet to the swi@@ mm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you can not switch on TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue in queue without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los to hear .
and then there is still Log@@ an D@@ oo@@ ley .
D@@ oo@@ ley , which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s war@@ med with grass , would certainly have been among these familiar names that were sent to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ tv advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fet@@ ters .
but D@@ oo@@ ley , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold .
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illuminated any event equal .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air@@ brush , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the chest , and may it rule for a long time .
but if I might suggest modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney , the last 16 years has noticed that many that I had asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympics type .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the US sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012 , who managed it to the end @-@ round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline res@@ ides a certain outdoor char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a few enthusiasts .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to ending clouds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , which combines two sports that are essentially united .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must land a number of falling movements ( rotating , he@@ ats and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
they are rated according to the official Olympi@@ ad after execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio .
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their quest for gold faster , faster , upward and beyond , sometimes up to the target , sometimes back and back , upwards and down on the playground .
they are not only hunting for the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the cur@@ wall , but also in the television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ad .
the pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I myself consider using these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
this offers the trampoline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a for@@ wards driving is not the destination .
he or she pr@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an astronom@@ er , goes upwards , then down effortlessly back upwards .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target , no w@@ ro@@ b in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant abolition of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only can be .
the qualification and end @-@ round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming for 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .

violent protest in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters , to demand political changes in Ethiopia , rose by violent resistance by the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at s@@ uss@@ sion .
is Ethiopia straight to break down ?
over the past ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last few months , protests against the government are coming to the country and in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people climbed up to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses said that polic@@ emen were shot at zig un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
themselves in the run @-@ well @-@ being video about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , how safety people suggest young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand against a wall .
the leader of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is much appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new com@@ mu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently pursued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent to exile or in prison , or driven into the expan@@ se of the wilderness .
but this could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and do not have any other options except to protest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ian region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous griev@@ ances that cover all from the ground use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a considerable election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , tensions along the border to Eritrea rise ; a fight for these jag@@ ged , controversial line called for in June hundreds of lives .
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des , which have been more or less forced in recent years to benefit turbul@@ ence and armed themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of im@@ bit@@ ing after years of age are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheap smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services .
even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet @-@ pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians have given that they gathered themselves to protest .
the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest ethn@@ ici@@ ties in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia is mainly Christian do@@ ves , in the politics and the economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of whom are living and living in low@@ land areas .
but even this is changing just .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated un@@ fair by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray that constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was seen as the tactical genius , a man who could think about the corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected relatively un@@ due for reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ireland , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia was such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ ested , which were decei@@ ved and subsequently stolen by the government according to claims by the government .
during the following ra@@ ids have been killed many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and that time of turmoil was relatively quickly past .
development experts Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new com@@ mu@@ ter train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , Prot@@ esti@@ ck in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray &apos;s shops , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is always practiced in social media .
analysts say that the protests of the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for poetry flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently dealt with that she has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to collapse its allies in a already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; congratulations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement by Obama on ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump attempted to all@@ ay the final controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by announ@@ cing that his repeatedly repeated cont@@ en@@ tion , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clear position threw new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republi@@ can , whether he is able to communicate and communicate with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also brings his collaborators who strive to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the peculiar position , statements that he could not be meant at all .
having made the clear@@ ance of an election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump had made reference to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn &apos;t intended to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but in an early morning t@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the t@@ we@@ et was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ witt Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help to weak@@ en this statement by remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him , the Republi@@ can presidential did@@ actic wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of the criticism pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump as he tried to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to exp@@ ir@@ ation changes on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speaking to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has given sar@@ cas@@ m already to its defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism on himself , when he said the Russians should appear Mrs. Clin@@ ics E@@ mails , but later he said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the language limits in politics and then return to requirements .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then if necessary , &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication @-@ sex@@ ist who observed the language of both candidates .
but I also think he is very cle@@ verly enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of resol@@ ves the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an even other sound , as its re@@ frac@@ tures are further backward .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a guided tour with great advantage over the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologize for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he frequently accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humour false .
but while he is strengthened the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ bearing into the un@@ comfortable situation , to be standing independent of how pro@@ voc@@ ative may also be his statements .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giu@@ li@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps of prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Giu@@ li@@ ani said he was asked to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that in front of Obama ISIS is an almost unknown , small organisation , he called her but@@ t@@ ins , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , there allowed ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , to tre@@ ad on every one of his words and be taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mo@@ ck the &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You may not ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats reported about Mr. Tr@@ umps excuse than just another evidence that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once crossed over the price of the market , café is coming back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by cafe in Williamsburg where you could just pay cash that no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front has been pushed .
the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set the verb in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes .
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a genetically modified city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ie wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still don &apos;t believe the CB@@ GB dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
but when New York change is , then it is also new @-@ finding .
a re@@ animated ver@@ b cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained many things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els the same es@@ presso model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment too .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are pra@@ ises like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ced on@@ ions .
there are natural bow@@ ls .
the café is not serving a beer anymore , there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also pushed through prices from Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer recently on a Sunday .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived early in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way off .
once the verb had closed , she gave a while the coffee leg , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I became clear that it was in the coffee and culture in the verb who liked me &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ i tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal since the beginning of the year 2003 was another long @-@ time and loyal customer .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets its usual place , but sometimes he switches his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese starting .
Rodri@@ guez said he doesn &apos;t have a Gro@@ ll about that the soap business has taken up the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie actually offered a special soap for verb with the cold coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go back to their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café as well .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has planned to make them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice office would like to fill the cold coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was tribal , and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café was closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the Bet@@ ween the Lok@@ um and the Order felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ elled the sm@@ elling &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin DEL@@ AN@@ O Roo@@ sev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val Office .
the gour@@ mets had President Roo@@ sev@@ elt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
its menu on this day was somewhat more modest : cor@@ ed eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ow@@ ree and as dessert a p@@ id pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with passionate people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Zie@@ gel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was inspired by the Chinese cuisine in the US , while Zie@@ gel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her newest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in the Har@@ per publishing house , illustrated the history of American cuisine during Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop to supp@@ er , a small , schn@@ ör@@ fl@@ ess Imb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 .
goat , 54 , ordered a fresh dra@@ inage , with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn had fun with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixing .
as the re@@ porter Hack@@ br@@ ates ordered this , this was the couple for discussing the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said goodbye .
there was snow@@ bread , liver cheese and sav@@ ory bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little endor@@ sement , which stre@@ ak the ingredient .
imagine such a lot of pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ste .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have placed in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ached for male field workers and it was served fresh baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the land of the land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans a central , tense subject , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it .
just as tense was the new budget of budget@@ ary : mysterious dishes like lo@@ aves and cas@@ cade have been re @-@ stap@@ le , the Kas@@ ser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful nature , eating remains re @-@ confidence , &quot; mer@@ ging goat , because chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a Cre@@ ed Sau@@ ce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry c@@ low@@ ds .
meat which has been the center of American cuisine for years became a rare luxury .
peculiar mixing were tried out , since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nouris@@ hing satisfaction prevail over taste or even healthy kitchen .
while their research for the book that also includes recipes , draw a dish from that epoch , baked on@@ ions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zie@@ gel@@ mann goes further away : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked on@@ ions are not suited to each other .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since then , our fiscal action - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country is good .
by publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policy makers &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals to turn out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ Essen .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm@@ houses in his kitchen , he is like the millions of millions of world that he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost gold dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was delightful real@@ y alien .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ anor had called him to stat@@ u@@ ate him with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present@@ er of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roo@@ sev@@ elt took that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ted food prepared .
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the Leg@@ acy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said goodbye , and on how science has been applied to food .
the pair gave me better understood by writing the book &apos;s eating habits in mother @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the wast@@ age of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploitation .
after the plates at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s were ab@@ or@@ derly , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ men@@ o who ate President Roo@@ sev@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said goodbye and added that it was a common trick , humble recipes one send a name to miss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no s@@ nap cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone turned something reluc@@ t@@ antly to get a spoon into the che@@ wing , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e took three times a night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can Do Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few hated wal@@ nuts would help &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed by bombs , he was the Hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he is killing everything to save life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself has died in a façade of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Hel@@ met , &quot; a civil protection group that has saved lives according to image newspaper until 6@@ 0.000 people .
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives in the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to help make first aid in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil conserv@@ ation@@ ist , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby out of the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians on the shining symbols in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he has never seen himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the picture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I am dying to save lives , I think God in me sees a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar itself became an attack to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attack in Syria .
the Hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ters have rejected four fac@@ bom@@ bers above the Alzheimer adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ ine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remains of the bomb , so that no children play it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; c@@ ites the picture his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to take terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verte@@ br@@ isk is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually come only in winter to finish .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to the present day .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie will only get up with 150 years of offspring .
dam@@ ely swi@@ ms of Greenland along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is at average only 1,@@ 220 feet far .
only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates on s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed , half as fast as a robot .
this kind of slow@@ ness shaped lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comments Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ enligh@@ in from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifes@@ pan , which means for verte@@ br@@ ates a world record . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolution@@ ists assumed a long time that Greenland are st@@ ony st@@ ony .
only absent the evidence .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water @-@ temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface only in winter .
through the lifestyle of Greenland researchers researchers know accordingly little .
their time lu@@ pin measurements they when they sold six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transm@@ itter .
loot make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a robot , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw @-@ kno@@ b of a young ice @-@ bears .
possibly they hunt for sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol , at the bottom of the ice sea and look for Kad@@ aver , which are from higher water layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a con@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimeters measured .
to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of shar@@ ks of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens arises even before the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ core .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as an atomic weapon @-@ attempt larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
in the third @-@ length animal with 220 centimeters in length , the lin@@ sen@@ ders took a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of the atomic weapon , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in its investigation in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lin@@ sen@@ sed , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters can even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ females only then get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now , the researchers were able to assign the length to the age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the Geschlechts@@ rei@@ ther and his age has been determined with 156 years , Greenland can be evident at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be a world record for verte@@ br@@ ates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in freezing waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was inserted a 120 year old har@@ po@@ stage , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals live on spar@@ kle .
so they mature later - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , by which the animal is built .
the heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than in a gram@@ mar elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate as early as possible as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolution@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ in .
a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .
construction in double pack
with topics around the building , the council at the most recent meeting has focused on focus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief the body of Mayor Robert P@@ utz took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Communication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Communication &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to finally start the marketing of the recently designated residential units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the property management , par@@ cel@@ ing and invo@@ icing questions were clarified , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; Stre@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( field of Bin@@ der@@ straße - Ex@@ tract section 1 ) to interested parties is nothing more in the way .
the council is convinced that the dioc@@ ese in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and rude elderly alike .
as it was meant , construction will be able to report immediately in the hall of the hall , on the allocation of the plots , the council is expected to advise in its September session .
to also request requests to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs that can come up , the council decided to res@@ ign the area @-@ use plan in sub@@ divisions only during the spring of this year .
thus , in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , this is already extended to two par@@ c@@ els direction of the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the city on the Main has emerged in competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to move from London to attract jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands , head of the competence markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ xit @-@ referendum it is uncertain whether money homes will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the approval for the so @-@ called EU passport can be approval in the United Kingdom so far .
this is just a big U.S. banks .
several banks have already announced , jobs to shift .
the Lob@@ by@@ Association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; is anticip@@ ating 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main Event five years .
for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is speaking of responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other major authorities such as European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk assessment of ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) have its head office , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the Not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Luxembourg there is a large fund industry , but also like Dublin at the infrastructure worse off .
Frankfurt be significantly easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the great airport .
further points the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not that easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ lands .
on the Seine are also the rent for class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the main ones .
furthermore , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life than the competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city is located in place seven , Luxembourg on No. 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ di@@ lec@@ tions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit @-@ V@@ ote &apos;s most important financial center in Europe , I will remain my economic explor@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this also , the power relations : in London they worked in accordance with figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. government decided that Gilead is entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have emerged from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a claim of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medicines So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after an American judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ ethical actions .
in the complaint of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. counter@@ part and Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree of the costs resulting during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to retreat with Gilead that dominated the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .

the troops supported by the US that they have restored full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State

Clin@@ ics deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 %
Hill@@ ary Clinton has released their tax return for 2015 , which revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the presidential and her husband , a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clin@@ ton &apos;s USD 1 Million for charitable purposes , chie@@ fly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton posted an income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ins from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax@@ payers of the last ten years .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ica Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ fer@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mier@@ i was known in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a cr@@ ush , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false interpre@@ ters and re@@ trac@@ ts with regards to his previous promises to publish his tax @-@ articles .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax releases , although they are not obliged by law to do so .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax examination by the tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Ac@@ ton vot@@ ee @-@ hel@@ fer@@ in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential did@@ actic of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps Special consultant , to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the controller are not completed .
Tr@@ umps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential elections of 2012 , Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that its ref@@ usal issues relating to assets , its donations for charitable organisations , its commercial and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump call for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject even during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential did@@ actic has done in recent decades and publish his tax arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times marked on Friday a series of tax evasion and tax consultants , information that could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that would make sure individuals pay more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal too .
during an election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton last week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Berk@@ shire Hath@@ away Industrie@@ con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , Tr@@ ump talks to a meeting in order to exchange control .
Buff@@ et said that he has been subjected to the IR@@ S as well as a tax examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ ton &apos;s campaign will return to 2007 tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , which now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income as wage @-@ related , unlike most of all Americans .
its main terrain was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 failed .

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works by promoting Tanz@@ an@@ ias ele@@ ph@@ ants
natural environ@@ ment@@ alists in Tanzania use a Orthodox way to hold ele@@ ph@@ ants of them , to go away from people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them , which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already begun years ago , has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by practicing volunteers in villages in the north Tanz@@ an@@ ias , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvesting without hurt animals .
previously , many spe@@ ars have used to defend oneself .
Friday is World ele@@ f@@ ant@@ ent@@ ag dedicated to the animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed this ...

the first two steps include the illumin@@ ate of the ele@@ ph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
if it is not be@@ wil@@ dered , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der ge@@ mi@@ xt with earth will be packed together with a fire@@ works , which is turned into a con@@ dom , whose end up to the ig@@ nition is turned .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom comes with a knot@@ s and spra@@ ying fine dust to Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ce into the air .
a hint of right is usually already out to hunt the ele@@ ph@@ ants .
a last option is a ship@@ pers that sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ work in the air and thereby causing a loud , bright explosion .

Jewish director sm@@ ite Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; &quot; &quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media release after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not listed an Israeli pre @-@ election as it requested Arab guests according to an employee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann , Lanz@@ mann , tried to find the hotels of the hotel .
however , the country was not listed among the countries which can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how about 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel on its own call center .
after a declaration , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer that he received there , &quot; saw him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the action was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it was , del@@ etes in the director even more anger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were disp@@ osed of this event and were troubled .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this in Germany has carried into exactly this hotel chain , is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the minister of ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident prov@@ oked a fairly large resonance on the internet where people called for a sc@@ andal .
some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged &quot; Arab guests &quot; requests . &quot;
&quot; s@@ hab@@ by you , &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct directive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel could not enter the Schnell@@ list list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung writes a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country @-@ election has now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students came together in Sao Paulo with the police on Thursday when they gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to dis@@ appoint the students , which led to the police of rubber @-@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their con@@ ster@@ nation over the plans .
according to the proposals by the govern@@ ors of the Federal State Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest@@ ors looked at Gra@@ ff@@ iti@@ ts against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests came to the streets a few days after the demonstr@@ ators left to the streets to support the susp@@ ects President D@@ il@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been relie@@ ved from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ at D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading set between Moscow and Teheran , in the year , grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ adors .
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the further commercial building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading set between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 amoun@@ ted to 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 rising and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , the Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and contributed $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
the commercial down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador .
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes for this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign representative announced around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily by Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , as regards the economy number in Russia .
one could say that the record @-@ payment of Iranian tourists in Russia from the last year , broke , &quot; he said .
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received Mon@@ uments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .

Ha@@ iger@@ loch : pilgrims to the gate of mercy
the Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral unit E@@ ster @-@ Ha@@ iger@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been dealt with .
to bridge the time up to the next no@@ vels of all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the past two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ se@@ round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
different place of pilgrimage has been tested and decided finally to the Bis@@ hop@@ pers of Freiburg , where he opened a special pilgrimage destination in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ iger@@ loch and Heiligen@@ bedrooms were on their way .
in the evening before the pastor of Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a little celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ ms down .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where a Münster is one of the old woman and so the pilgrimage path was taken away from the Münster .
the single day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and writers .
but also on the way , the min@@ is went to dirt , chap@@ els or churches again and again ru@@ des to sing a song from the pilgrims of the pilgrims .
for the nights stood at the parish of the local Par@@ ish Par@@ ish .
at the stage of the album , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty as well as a star@@ ken@@ ess dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
tags at that one entered the stage to St. Peter , which was the ti@@ ring road track , but had to be heated at the heat of around 500 metres in the heat and after that it will be over@@ heard .
the deserved reward was a common gri@@ lling on bath in the evening .
after the morning impul@@ sion on the fourth pilgri@@ m day in the imposing Kloster@@ kirche von St. Peter we went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ appe to Freiburg .
clearly eas@@ ed and happy met the min@@ is in the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster , and crosses the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse given here God thanks .
in the evenings in the year @-@ fair the Pil@@ gri@@ m Min@@ is welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last evening in the men team Sprint in Rio to glory , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the tigh@@ tening role , which had made his deputy Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to a victory from the Favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics medals .
they repeated the trick after it took place in March at the railway World Championships in London despite the back @-@ up Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the An@@ de@@ ers Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they remained , when they saw the potential in the car@@ rots , that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who runs four years ago with Ho@@ y si@@ eg@@ ed - and Sk@@ inner in the Quali@@ fication rounds include an Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord , but in the still@@ s the New Zealand took place in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap there was just under back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner .
a strategy change made a large part of the transformation that drove to the execution in a higher gear to slow it down and to make it characteristic and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when this was on the podium .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for me .
we have put up a Olympi@@ are@@ k@@ ord in the duck @-@ dogs and defeated the World Champion .
it was simply incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des came to that after a weak start , it was clearly visible .
he returned to this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such a great victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like London with all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together in the last three months as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world@@ sur@@ titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the area of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a great deal of six gold medals and a silver medal .
che@@ eses of the ho@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lon@@ es@@ ome to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be defeated for the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ al competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four od@@ ometer racing .
they came to the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which was won in 2012 in London was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will be focused on safety .
he had denied himself yesterday with reference of the qualification as the function@@ ary to himself , to measure his body size .
in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , tomorrow continued and finished , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in World War II in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves itself to be a strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a di@@ ar to medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
it also played drama in the background , so the resignation of the Technical Leit@@ er Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and har@@ b@@ ing@@ rays as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
however , if one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ b@@ S , which at the perfect moment has reached its peak to be repeated again .
future of the melt filtration of Portland due to the abolition of energy contrac@@ tu@@ ally
the future of aluminium sm@@ el@@ mel@@ tdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs by workers - are at stake , since the plant operator will announce the energy supply agreement and thus deliver all delivery orders , as the supplied energy company shared .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a vote for 20 years is going on in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect , could be at risk .
in addition , it could come to domin@@ ance effects as the mel@@ ting around 10 percent of total electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry mel@@ ting ei , which led last year to an closure of the fro@@ es@@ ea power station .
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Portland lose money and risky an closure .
this step follows the years spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum mel@@ tdown with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three additional owners will announce their contracts .
the facility is part of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , which will hold the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to be operated , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt filtration , &quot; divided the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L also said that the agreements called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he@@ dging operations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should have come into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice , so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on the revenues on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong termin@@ ology for wholesale estrogen .
AG@@ L divided that it was already written the value of the agreements already in its annual install@@ ment of $ 18@@ 7 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to reserve the agreements , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the mel@@ ting system or to guarantee the power supply to the melt production . &quot;
the U.S. company said it was completed in 2010 a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , which should have come into effect from November this year , even if there is still a statement , why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic circumstances of the industry in front of the possible closing of the Portland mel@@ ting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements of analy@@ st at the start of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is around 600 me@@ ga@@ watts and tomato around 900 me@@ ga@@ watts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , it would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as a generating set , it would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of cov@@ eted Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ ant of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand message of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ vers brought me to crying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote kis@@ sing all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unve@@ iling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans ) family ( except the problems of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ lyn , as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of her sister and that ends with a classical turn : you all have a surprise party planned .
this represents the cl@@ ums@@ y action nearly every birthday sep@@ tic of a children &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; you covered the sentence , &quot; you covered the sentence , &quot; with the honesty of a cartoon animation at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate their other girls somehow in this public@@ ation .
with regard to the Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began .
K@@ end@@ om &apos;s big sister Kim likes what the Vo@@ gue covers , they have beaten ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ ant of the magazine is a league for itself .
the sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ ant is for Vo@@ gue the most selling issue of the year .
with a girth which resembles rather a picture band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unve@@ iling of his Co@@ ver@@ stars is anticipated so cute that in the last two years pictures of the magazine were released even prior to the official announcement .
women who have already been on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda G@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ rities , the models &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celeb@@ rities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ rities are not related to famous individuals or Reality stars or young people of today , who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s all on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are interested in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of their career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
naturally Jen@@ ners &apos;s success not like everyone .
with her reality @-@ TV history , Jen@@ ners &apos;s attitude was always tense in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ined high , when the message with the Er@@ seem Jen@@ ners came out at the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to tre@@ ad on the face seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sep@@ tem@@ ber@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
she sold her paintings by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is in the Reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
international ventures in 16@@ 0,000 people annually
over 16@@ 0,000 of the aid of the country , more than 16@@ 0,000 of the Federal Republic of the country will be deduc@@ ted each year by the municipal law centres , while the sector is committed to the impact of further medi@@ tations on already over@@ sized transactions .
in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly older people , immigrants , vulnerable workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ers , and those who are looking for free legal advice and legal advis@@ ors .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly signed , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , these legal centers will lose other 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the municipal law centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of community studies revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a cancellation of the Federal Government would only become worse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Queens@@ bridge &apos;s common centers are chronic , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ manage@@ able and impressive debt , families who were dis@@ missed through separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this collection shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will be cut by 30 percent as of June 2017 , meaning that thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these medi@@ tations , so that people may need the help they need in legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the federal government fulfilled their commitment to raise funds for legal aid to national average .
it is now time to view the needs of the community centres and their communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k into this important work .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the government parties and CD@@ U are counted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this took representative surveys of the opinion research and opinion research IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government @-@ wars in the north just continue to rule , this is not possible after the re@@ frac@@ ture in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the most powerful party and thus would have good opportunities to continue the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD brought up the SPD from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent more than 24 percent .
according to the pol@@ l , the party is only just under front of the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed among the left and the Af@@ D .
the left came to 19 per cent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day .
the Gre@@ ens hesit@@ ates despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the heav@@ y@@ ons of Land@@ tag .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country of the country .
at the Berlin Chamber of Directors , the SPD shows the survey of survey only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would miss the objection in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the successor today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ os and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty knock .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight me@@ gab@@ ytes , which would be today enough for about two bliss with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they are somehow from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ pane .
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in the West Bank &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages has been possible via HTML @-@ browser , although qu@@ el@@ ingly slow .
a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , if not for Nokia .
the mobile @-@ division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled on Microsoft .
the market now dominate the market that all came a lot later than Nokia .
always and everywhere else , this is today for a lot of people everyday life .
in 2015 there was nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices sold , on Samsung and Apple , 5@@ 55 million copies have been sold .
the global sales with the equipment is about 400 billion euros .
this includes the well ongoing transactions of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone is now created a whole industry .
the key breakthrough for the mass market was first launched in early 2007 , then Apple @-@ Chief Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World launch the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet @-@ communication , easy to use via touch @-@ screen .
the winner of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , ruled the market , had the night .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention , a matter of course .
at the moment every German today sees 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to learn all to put the smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens @-@ governing board responsible for personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ que , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will come back by creating new possibilities for local and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities , we already have 10,000 new apprentic@@ es , 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the airport environment are preparing an end .
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who are thinking that the challenge of enlar@@ ging army is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ eag@@ les had wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any questions asked .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn on we@@ ather@@ ing growth and to leave a legacy of abilities and employment both around the airport and all the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented tre@@ ach@@ ers of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as create a legacy of skills and employment , can be proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; for ad block block
for companies that earn money with online earning money according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block de@@ block , a &quot; k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game &quot; alike .
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad temp@@ tations on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post , in which it provided that users could update their filters in the program to again block advertising in the social network .
on Tuesday shared Facebook with that his desktop page would change the coding for its advertisement in order to display it ad temp@@ tations about which part of the page advertising is to make difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to byp@@ ass the new codes .
in a blog@@ post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the an@@ zei@@ ant Open Source Community and the round@@ ing have been underway since the In@@ vention of Ad For@@ giving ad , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world @-@ largest company has allowed itself to fight social media in the fight is a strong clu@@ b@@ tion for how worrying ad temp@@ ting for the industry have become . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study conducted by the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people for ad temp@@ er ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , handles 84 percent of the advertising revenue is derived from .
the company has it on display block block on desktop PCs as well as mobile ad block blocking no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and instinct , shared a spokes@@ person .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of revenue , so that Facebook appears as re@@ warding as a re@@ warding .
on Tuesday , Facebook told that there would be his &quot; ad plac@@ id tool &quot; to update more control over them .
on Thursday stated Facebook that Ad@@ block would be worrying about new filters , because they would also block the content on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user does not represent a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared a spokes@@ person from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

woman ben@@ k@@ ic@@ icide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police are witnesses to witness after a woman was transferred to a highway on Thursday during the early morning hours on Thursday .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d , shortly after midnight .
a woman lay down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were met by several cars , the police came out of Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a sweat in the age of 49 years , those of several vehicles , including a truck , was handed over to kill themselves .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , those as well as any witness of the incident , calls to sign up .
a investig@@ ative procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , shared Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de genetics .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - in which a person in the dark on the free@@ way was going - was decided that the passenger is not going to assume that a pedestrian walk in the middle of the night runs on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year was acqu@@ itted a poli@@ cem@@ ic of the driving killing killing , after having passed a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious on the road , took the court .
the Court found that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- who had responded to a call - in a justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely exceptional and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the region of Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate mam@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once hab@@ itable .
scientists at Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA have developed a model to discover the past of Venus with tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate research .
the model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have been treated with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously suggested that the slow transformation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have a thin that Venus could have had a similar atmosphere and still turned slowly .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet was probably rejected more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accom@@ o@@ date life and protect life more quickly .
the early Venus prof@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation expon@@ ents the slow transformation of Venus its daily side of the sun almost two months long , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer between clouds , which affects the surface of a large part of sun war@@ ms .
the result are average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected by plant@@ ing research .
although it once was probably extinct was the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light .
her oceans dun@@ geon and her water v@@ ap@@ oration has been burned down from the ultra@@ violet light .
as their Hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy is going back as a trainer of the Aval@@ anche
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations in the Colorado Aval@@ anche and led to a low resolution to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and agreed that the association will immediately search for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last three years I have filled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations in the Colorado Aval@@ anche with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vo@@ iced the 50 @-@ year Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of summer , I thought long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this it needs and bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey operations have to be perfectly adapted to the organization .
he must also have a co @-@ determination of decisions which influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic who had been consul@@ ted by Roy on 23 May 2013 , thanks for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last years .
the Aval@@ ches recorded in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ Card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the Aval@@ anche .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ dy labor@@ ers again take talks on , put strike out
the labor force concerning the wages of North @-@ se@@ wage workers will be exposed , while all parties set for a new discussion round the table , they said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field service providers were spor@@ adi@@ c on platforms in the North Sea which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ establish the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems anew .
the trade unions told that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 per cent .
wood Group led the instal@@ ments to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the ac@@ ron@@ ym of the company follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released thousands of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries because it ration@@ alized his business activities as a result of his meg@@ az@@ reunion with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , a economic situation , which had increased by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament Commissioner Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that have been held since a generation in the North Sea .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only a few works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion to expenditure on new projects in North Sea compared with an average of roughly $ 7 billion expected in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rates of stars in the observatory of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler which has helped cosm@@ ologists to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ations among the stars of the star of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data can help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in the observatory for different rates , as well as in what context the rotation periods are related to the planning process .
&quot; we hope that we experienced by the same of our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ Tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the ast@@ er@@ age of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the earth .
many stars in this constellation , which were created some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
you are now turning right now .
in peak rates , these mature stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
since this win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is age , his rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each of the star by recogn@@ ising the time between the appearance of a discer@@ n@@ able star -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ations points out that a massive star slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , making bigger stars slower Pi@@ rou@@ ter than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ades we see that slow rotation tend to be massive , whereas faster th@@ rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
since the star @-@ p@@ ile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates .
&quot; the observatory of the P@@ lei@@ ades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still much ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when , when , and why stars slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades published soon in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star occurs
the tears ran from Alex Rodri@@ guez than the U.S. Bas@@ eball star in best days from Base to Base .
after his emotional review , the 41 year old pro on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays will carry out the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos;s &apos; to both the 14 @-@ mal@@ ige All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times was elected for the most valuable players in the league , 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series .
his signature under a tenth of the year contract has been compl@@ ained of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contrast on 31 December 2017 , he is acting as a consultant and youth coach - in full salary .
as players paid it Rodri@@ guez back time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed some milestones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays indicate two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics of similar values .
but in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old will not be recorded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in the field , it is controversial outside the place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star was taken to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken bot@@ t@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was locked up to 211 games due to a completion in the so @-@ called bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ guez is considered as the main suspic@@ ious , for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 as I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days did not go wrong .
while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage once again Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; ätz@@ te Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , was said to have sympathy for fans from the Yan@@ ke@@ e Mountains Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the followers of the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : C@@ hen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first Dop@@ ing@@ cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing of endurance , weight loss of Adrian Ziel@@ inski must not start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official Dop@@ ing@@ cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wis@@ er Ath@@ lon could have won almost a medal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing of the Olympic Games have become known in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese swi@@ mmer in C@@ hen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ k@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish weights of Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions come these messages to the Un@@ time .
at C@@ hen was already proven the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ h means for dop@@ ing .
the International Sport@@ ger@@ ichtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only about 0,@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze .
on Friday C@@ hen would have to take part in the for@@ ego@@ ing about 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
C@@ hen has requested the opening of the B and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demanded from C@@ hen full cooperation in investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ ger@@ ichtshof CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is not the IO@@ C but the CA@@ S is responsible for the integration of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ ed the message over the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , it is said to act with the har@@ ass@@ ed substance on the blood dop@@ ing of EP@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dan@@ ek@@ owa has been temporary , according to B@@ NT , the B test should also be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov was immediately expressed with criticism of the Ath@@ lon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , approximately all weights of the chronic dop@@ ing nation must not take part in Rio .
on Friday the case , &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympi@@ ad in the class until 85 kg was tested like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ aboli@@ c stero@@ idal N@@ and@@ lon .
both cont@@ oured the intake , both of which are not allowed to start in the class until 94 kg .
prior to the start of athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another severe blow to the rep@@ lica of the whole sport .
the World association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the L@@ äu@@ er Kenya produced in Rio numerous bad news .
in the swimming pool , the former ship@@ ments had also taken care of fierce conflicts between the athletes .
thus , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ asi@@ an Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; Sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I see the podium more than 200 m free , I want to commit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with Austr@@ ali@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in the Chinese champ@@ ionships a positive effect on the ab@@ ul@@ ose of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ ks@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de compres@@ ses their ran@@ som
programmer of compres@@ sing mal@@ ware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey conducted by the mal@@ ware defense specialists in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly several times of a attack with black@@ board software .
in Germany just 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a gro@@ om@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail .
40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators special@@ ize their er@@ pres@@ ser software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes with attack on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially sof@@ tening sol@@ vent is much higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we currently observe a start@@ ling fast evolution of the pollut@@ ant software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered the cul@@ ation software for itself .
only privately , private use the goal , but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months quickly .
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is working after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ nutrition Bit@@ coin .
but where with private users the personal photo database is at stake , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly higher the damage falls when a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware proposes .
22 per cent of the German firms involved in sales by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany many hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say the victims always : paying not , it only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of the firms pay , their data will get back .
for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a stal@@ em@@ ate in the operation .
the h@@ ackers again know that and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study the security researchers of F @-@ secure the utility areas and the contact with the presses are examined and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct access websites or de@@ code for free example files .
and if individuals sol@@ ves to payments of a few hundred Euros , companies need to negotiate hard and five digit sums have to pay for their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware detection , the h@@ ackers explains more professional and share the work , explains safety @-@ per@@ ched Ch@@ ester Wis@@ nie@@ wski from Anti@@ virus @-@ providers Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a r@@ ans@@ om@@ ware roughly within one week . &quot;
probable it is however , that it is about three or four persons .
the programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software module to the actual presses .
the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and brand@@ ing can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the presses are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to distribute the freshly caught software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminals and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per in@@ toler@@ ated machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually instruc@@ t the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware is now known by many companies that are better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey will trust R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetrators are instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
in this way , the damage potential , according to the type of data is still a much higher than before .
the perpetrators can also take entirely new goals on the Internet of Things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers how they could get a control of the Internet connected thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the sel@@ fis@@ sion of a so @-@ block heating could be quite a ran@@ som .
if the perpetrators are then blocking an entire production road in a factory in the future , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware might be a subject in the industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday .
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that has been designed on the same new platform as the new jazz is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V rather small , passengers have a lot of space in both the first row and in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit upper side falls somewhat off .
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk area of 4@@ 53 l at the top and 10@@ 26 l at the opposite rest back , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical as it sounds : the seats of the back@@ bank can be high up like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to blankets 1.@@ 24 m high .
the trunk area can be well loaded , however , the charging height is somewhat higher with 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 N@@ m in wide range areas very powerful .
however , he is likely to do something quie@@ ter for his work .
pleasing is the everyday consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there are still another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engines with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ drive @-@ drive is not offered .
the behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment is in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; no wish un@@ fulfilled .
the security systems is one of the City &apos;s emergency brake ( works up to tempo 32 ) , the col@@ lis@@ ions system and the Sp@@ ur@@ inary assistant .
the col@@ lis@@ ions sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes because he ass@@ aul@@ ted many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ed objects . &quot;
very reliable working with remote control .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ eg@@ ler responded to the traffic detection and d@@ ros@@ sel@@ t on demand the speed .
the full connectivity are only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More .
two US@@ B@@ - and a HDMI @-@ jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit awk@@ ward .
the some 29@@ 000 euros for the well equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , receives the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel over 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines satisfy the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and daily routine .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall to Air@@ craft
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air bridge .
for a liability is thin@@ kable only with dangers that are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ing the Upper National Court of Düsseldorf ( AZ : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the overthrow of a knee br@@ ace .
however , the accident could have done everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court .
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease cases : when pays the organizer
suffering from vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back after their journey is only money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ ful in the hotel .
but that is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the tra@@ ded case a family was difficult for the second day of her tur@@ k@@ ei@@ ur@@ lau@@ ght with diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a def@@ ective aff@@ i@@ ation , which supposedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
the family was the view , the journey was faul@@ ty - and compl@@ ained against the organizer .
at the court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success .
indeed , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ lage was def@@ ective .
however , the organizer was only shortly before leaving the k@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his information , so the judgment .
especially since in the samples of water no contamin@@ ants were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by connecting with each other - belonging to the general life risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , following the victims of refugees in Würzburg , and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had concerned about further attacks .
the state must have n@@ uns and decided to react at the same time to terror .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and division .
this triumph , we will not treat the terrorists .
if offen@@ ders have to leave the country more quickly , but increase the security and strength of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals until the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced a further person@@ al strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ former size order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be under punishment .
video surveillance is to be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire will be manip@@ ulated as to the purchase of weapons on the internet .
the last much discussed silence @-@ light for physicians should remain met after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of mental views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social support .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
at the pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of the investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke against shareholders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a ear @-@ celebrated for the Shar@@ f@@ makers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship .
a general ban on the de@@ wor@@ ship@@ ing can be un@@ constitutional .
you can not for@@ bid all that you re@@ jects , and I reject the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road safety or witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter threw the Minister before , he wants to sim@@ ulate with new anti @-@ terror packages and man@@ oeu@@ vre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party @-@ party Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ stir and a tigh@@ tening of the common right bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic of traffic on the motorway
there is a regular basis on the road @-@ moving street - here is a picture of November .
but that is to change : the rule of law is to be extended .
this is good news for all cars who travel on the professional road every evening in the traffic street , if they go via the highway to go ( A 43 ) .
the country road building extends the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the Wes@@ eler street , the right b@@ ang road to 700 meters .
drivers can then direct from the hammer road to the right .
the great advantage : the traffic will share breakfast , thus making the overall result on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 improves .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the driving position on the Zu@@ br@@ inger thinks the motor@@ ists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days ranges from back@@ st@@ au to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her Way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be returned to a three @-@ three years ago .
the reason : static calculations resulted in fact that the bridge has no longer the required hydro@@ power to absorb in particular the heavy @-@ loading traffic .
how long this Eng@@ pass and the associated ste@@ au will last will not say , the relevant country is not able to say .
however it is to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official rest period up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the state office has chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities may be reck@@ oned .
the traffic is carried out on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project now .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s allows people to visit people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible House &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years the staging in the Small House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes have the opportunity to visit within the framework of this project cultural institutions in Münster .
most young people of the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ o@@ graphi@@ es , the s@@ zen@@ ische paintings and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the procedure , nevertheless , to follow the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the association N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from Spra@@ ying , and the Young Theatre will cooperate in the upcoming season as part of a musical research project .
from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years should receive the possibility of visiting professional , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the theatre game and theatri@@ cal courses are in the planning .
the project &quot; intercultural journey &quot; continues .
given the Ascen@@ ded refugee figures , the association is counting on many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope to repair
the weather has made the star@@ ring Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night for Friday a line with the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the Cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the president of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather is supposed to be good , then we &apos;ll definitely see many constell@@ ations in the sky .
at the star@@ ring it is a soap , which belong to the fastest star @-@ sn@@ ags with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name , because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one heated ever@@ lasting around , at night one is awake after spending hours , in the morning there is much more to think about sleep in the morning .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about a quarter of adults sleeping disorders and over ten percent feel frequent or permanent as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different causes under@@ lie , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , executive board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping research and sleeping .
what you understand among them is the In@@ som@@ nie , so an inhal@@ ation and a sleeping @-@ compul@@ sive disorder .
just that , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board member of the German household doctor with practice in the lower @-@ Sax@@ on var@@ el .
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sle@@ eves are complex .
behind it can organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ ing factors , but also medicines are stuck .
not rare is the sleeping @-@ compul@@ sive expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is especially common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are different .
those who for example has a band shoot , can lie bad , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and begin to p@@ onder@@ ously , about everyday problems and worries , gives we@@ e@@ ß an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should one be with sle@@ eves to the doctor ?
who does not sleep well over a month for a month in at least three nights per week and the day is affected , should go to the doctor , betra@@ y we@@ e@@ ß .
the draw@@ backs can look quite differently : one is ab@@ stain@@ ed , tired , un@@ slept , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate the sleep @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , it is important to find out its causes .
as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes occur , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional and most for two weeks - in@@ question .
exu@@ ber@@ ant dormit@@ ory has hardly been acc@@ entu@@ ated in Germany , &quot; Prof. In@@ go Fie@@ tz@@ e , Head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ory of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , one should look at sleeping problems first at the surgeon , betra@@ y we@@ e@@ ß .
this can be clarified up with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens ?
for the examination in the dormit@@ ories of medical professionals , for example with snor@@ ing with air@@ iness , in case of disease @-@ fatigue , in sle@@ e@@ eds or if you do not find the cause of a de@@ plor@@ able disorder , Fie@@ tz@@ e explained .
actually , you do not need to prepare for an inquiry .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just do not make a nap , &quot; says Fie@@ tz@@ e .
after the cab@@ ling , one gets to his normal time in bed .
besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nas@@ al l@@ asses , a chest strap , and a anten@@ na@@ e on the finger .
in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep .
how can people get a handle of the problems ?
there are quite a lot of pitches on which one can bet for better sleep .
We@@ e@@ ß counts on : regular sleeping and rising times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV for sleeping , alcohol m@@ ily and at night not look at the watch - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle un@@ resolved with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed themselves on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he had brought the gold master@@ ed for the first time at the Short World Championship in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler has been sanc@@ tified in the former ex @-@ team @-@ mates in front of his criticism .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ asi@@ ger receives € 20,000 pre@@ mie and a jungle un@@ charged 15@@ 0.000 € should no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing checks on the other hand very well .
in this way , we cannot compete with countries that can foster a lot and do not see exactly as accurate or operating on the topic D@@ oping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are set to be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( Nada ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before the World Cup / OS from independent control of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls on the choice of bur@@ gers , which meanwhile has an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de of Car@@ rier .
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the Airport Düsseldorf
civil wars of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police managed to take the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ suspected had committed several hand@@ ker@@ - and luggage carrier .
against 21.@@ 30 p.m , civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf was a banker again , which was known to the polic@@ emen from the previous theft of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several deliber@@ ations since mid July of July and were collectively a collaborative and very professional .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mes Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can indicate the th@@ ie@@ ves that were entered into Germany for crimes of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions .
in doing so , they had cut a total of more than 15@@ ,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ er , in either still a rest of the head@@ stone : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in seems at first glance not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to the west , one comes to playing places , a fres@@ her nursery and a be@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite to a Lid@@ l which should also be demol@@ ished soon : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in is called in the last weeks however preferred with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events .
especially at the Berlin interior Hen@@ kel in the beginning of the year , the police had spoken several times for a hard approach to the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy .
after 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmie@@ de , with 300 police officers had been vac@@ ated , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks long official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site , sper@@ sed parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
on 13th July , a Berlin Board of Directors decided that clear@@ ance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers went under the ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street works peaceful : parents go stro@@ lling with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about pre@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
left force is not the main community of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs here three children , are especially generated by police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising prices and rec@@ tification .
it does not sound according to a pine tree , which has a majority of poli@@ cem@@ an on the left of an Andalu@@ sian left .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior and the police are open between domestic and their neighbours so obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also today has a lower aver@@ aged in comparison with the rest of the city and has high poverty risk .
also home @-@ occupied and the born @-@ born projects are for a long time ago : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer has been vac@@ ated under large police officers in a regul@@ ator road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the rig and were still inhabited by the people today occupied by 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and the electoral liner from around the world : with them now people from GDR @-@ times and former house occupied their jaw .
this also has been noticeable in the r@@ ents that since 2009 has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the newly built buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one real@@ izes them in the wor@@ shipped sli@@ ces , or freshly k@@ nit@@ ted fac@@ ades that were buried with color @-@ exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the reasons that not all neighbours are considered to be a problem , be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as body violation shall affect statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most important part of the criminal off@@ ences are made of Saxony , which tends to take place more of the newly built houses and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years , there cannot be any talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is more important : people in 94 are their neighbours that have been determined not .
also the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er already longer .
for the studied architect , her street is not a crime point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ he street - and remained .
therefore it was also so important to her that the inhabitants left their street : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the explanation of the city .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to take away : through rever@@ ber@@ less new buildings in former buildings that are pushing the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is ultimately the property of ownership , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well involved &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do , if any one never list@@ ens ?
it sets out on all sides of frustration , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for those who are scattered abroad , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw .
anyone who draws , should be aware - just like someone who runs into a car@@ en@@ closure , can complain about noise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all persons named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persons named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are asked to not be called with their correct name &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Ann@@ ika Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Ann@@ ika Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer .
besides , she is Social @-@ worker from the spot .
since July Ann@@ ika Deu@@ sch@@ le the refugees for Ur@@ bach .
the social ped@@ agog@@ ical in supports the team of managing agate in Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees himself as a contact for all actors : refugees , colleagues , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the brigh@@ tening W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem .
as a result , some - fewer nuts , rather than looking for a variety of challenges - meant as the management wanted to write the place .
she was looking for a administrative unit with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an enligh@@ tening W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Ann@@ ika Deu@@ sch@@ le .
most of all , it is about organization , working with the local people and also behind the scenes , as well as power value .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been in part for about six weeks .
it has a 50 per cent spot on three years exp@@ ired .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Ann@@ ika Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ - and full @-@ time actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
new containers in Was@@ en@@ straße
a heavy problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting fle@@ es , which have been recognized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipalities are responsible for connecting the municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have to place the refugees in their own or registered residential rooms .
the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Federal Environment Agency to commune and job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as a very difficult time .
de facto there are no private apartments .
so far you do not have it yet , be reli@@ ant on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be er@@ ased , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Client and Ann@@ ika deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
besides a firm spell , it is practic@@ able , educational places , school courts , A @-@ Euro @-@ Jobs and pain@@ stak@@ eholder activities for refugees and migrants who need to be vulnerable or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do non @-@ profit work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy , as Ann@@ ika deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but work does not only mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a feeling of relatives .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also jump here administration and volunteers .
it is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful for example , for example with language courses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone , should not work and be useless , who will never be integrated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
problem : there are also problems , says customer honestly , &quot; people , at all at all goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent incident are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer really clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what could be naive to be naive &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ is@@ iko could be and doesn &apos;t want to exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ tized .
these incidents also be subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and honor@@ ary official site must be held in the area and in the region to activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants should come to Ur@@ bach soon .
does Germany need a cap ?
this is clear to answer this question , is the politics .
actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not there yet , where we would go , &quot; says Ann@@ ika Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher products are already pending before being able to re@@ integrate the previous people .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : be@@ bre@@ cher with helicopter
the police @-@ helicopter flew around an hour for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men are penetr@@ ated on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 pm in an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the people surprised the two and suggested the un@@ hol@@ de in the run .
the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ cot , both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black chap@@ er@@ pul@@ lis .
you flee towards the city centre .
the police put several strikes and a police helicopter .
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
eventually the unknown was indeed close to the apartment or at their escape .
