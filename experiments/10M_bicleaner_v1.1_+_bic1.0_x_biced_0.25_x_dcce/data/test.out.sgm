<seg id="3">At the end of a golf course in South Africa Bernhard Langer sought a little variation with some colleagues on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="11">He allowed himself to lead himself with his family about the plant of the ALRV, to a horse sang he doesn't even leave for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen, and with the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "investing in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - this is both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential points are however at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns that the state of the economy can harm, with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton would violate the economy to death and to regulate death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">But by contrast it would be quite different, maintains Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will massively cut it massively, and it makes itself strong for far-reaching controls with lower tax approaches - for private people and for companies.</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton says: the state has specific tasks to meet, he has to open a disadvantage of disadvantage and needs money.</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore, the taxes for the rich would be increased, says it.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost wore-like.</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the state-of Tey Tey-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, on Trump, you might still have a partial internal discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clear are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "Trump wants to build coal-power plants and overdrive coal production in the US." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "Clinton aims to expand renewable energies with its investment programme:" "" "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - also at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpacfish trade deal, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "at the same time, both of them want to isolate the US by international trade - but simply protect American jobs better." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "these should then also be better paid, calls for instance Clinton." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be, then he says he should not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy on the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics were before him, so that the budget deficit would just be even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics are saying: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every faded woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is one of women who flee their own lives alone, almost in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has placed her little son in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He is curious with great eyes inquisitive into the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother rigid on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice they will be observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is a business manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief services in Bavaria, and is concerned among other things with the issue of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are plowed.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich's north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs opened up the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Münchner's women's assistance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently, it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - approximately 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggeration to say: every woman who arrives here has done on their flight experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr.</seg>

<seg id="25">In their home country, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example to demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not uncommon," says Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "who believe that as soon as they are ankmen in Germany, irre, told Bahr." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Also here all women in refugee are often considered inferior and worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women, who live in Munich's accommodation in Munich, are traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily created."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "or they don't trust, speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Because they often don't know how to help, there will need more accommodations for them, calls for Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">On the question, whether they are using a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, respond some with no.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is such a thing in accommodations among governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">Also in Schwaben, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressespreaching of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Oberbayern, Lower and Mittelfranken, there are in some common shelters or their own homes only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>

<seg id="46">The washing rooms should be easily accessible and accessible to women in the study.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give the hands and proclaim an official end of the eight months long lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin perceives his Turkish counter-players in the gold Hall of St. Peter's Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara that Ankara wants to make this reconciliation most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles had scared and he did hardly any heat, even for his back-held circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report whole five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels prior to the crisis, but could even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved so badly as if nothing had happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">His enthusiasm was rather the opposite to indicate.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cool showed that the State of Russia had nothing to forget.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory: the overthrow of a Russian struggle aircraft at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was debrated.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to please Russia to the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The accident was even bigger, as it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">The crob will rebuild again becomes difficult, if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">Months long, the state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed like the Turks to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The most serious accusations were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria that are controlled by the so-called Islamic state.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a ceasefire lie clearly on hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after the last month at a failed coup d "état was at the top of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are picked up again.</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late seasonal anilstorm in the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week forecasted the state television cheap fruit and vegetables once the Turkish agrarian imports will be allowed once again.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti it follows: "tourists staying there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West as it seeks its reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued Groll come across the cutting-empo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the first to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "the Russian leader won in Ankara with certainty that he called for the elected government authorities after the attempted coup d" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a doubt for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a profound fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendorous palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, one, as it once described a analyst, "alliance of external lateral": two countries who rejected themselves from the West and feel badly treated.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently resigned the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents said on the press conference, they did not even soften the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey failed to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize that.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey depleted to the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state will at least talk to one another.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia Putin damert Stabilif Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin released his staff of Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">Ivanov was a lot of years of the engagements undertaken by Putin.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed to the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in a statement of the Kremlin, it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons" "" "the missal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been using Ivanov's representative since 2012 was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 1972, Tallinn, he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his degree at the renowned state of the Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's message.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it says (in Russian) that he later was a protocol and staff manager of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a statute of legislation and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and advised Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mystical.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the most engagements Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As a staff member, he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the staff will be resigned on their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Here is the consequence of a sort of power-struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently no one knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president, who would like to lead Russian environmental policies - came across great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his comments on Putin, who quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov "it's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, told me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turned out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the state security service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin called to power, he called Ivanov than one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once, Ivanov after Putin's second term president may be president of Russia, as a third presidential term coup against the constitution would have been rejected.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another, close allies Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1,35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four entries of the" "" "covers" "", "which approach to each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge of Fives is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete, and 46 Schrägropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1,35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic Minister Keith Brown became a visit today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queenstier crossover.</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of engineers from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the decay between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Altogether, nearly 79% of the entire bridge dates back to their place and the last section of Decks, today in Rosyth gets a betongation for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first registry represents a significant milestone in each Brückenprojekt.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this fantastic project the reversing high- and low-construction is represented.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last road lines and its connection with the expansion of Nordturmdeck, we had to then close an even existing gap on the north or country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimetres south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tonnes weighs and had to be pulled up at a slope of approx. 3% upwards.</seg>
<seg id="19">Heat, since the tolerances that the team works, tiny - on each side they bore only a few millimeters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and child are no longer going to go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time, staring on screens, has been lodged over the last decade of many.</seg>
<seg id="4">At Pokemon Go, it is about getting people from the sofa and to be more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and most recently to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was based on the characters who were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later emerged from the cartoon, game cards and other spin-off).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many phenomena of pop culture declined the interest in the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server oversized the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go more users as a tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players with their smart phones go out and search for Pokémons that are retraced with a GPS and once they were once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the Wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person has returned every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues the Washington Post recently, that within two days following the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people running every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent jumped.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to take" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to be active from the sofa" "" "and be active every day, because many public messages are boring to health and come to people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be assessed.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that people do it to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close to the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual there are also mashed gamers who must always complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It is a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if smartphone apps like FitBit has already been able to trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and use it with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world and will help many people on the hunt, more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="5">Dynamically on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breathtaking on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">On whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast dawm on Thursday to the multi-ring title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the headlights of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Their total output of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and the "Final Five" team mates in Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronzemedaillengelist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American Simone Biles, built on the pig-beams during the individual multi-race of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bila is the fourth heterosexual American female, which wins a multi-campaign, and a total of the fifth, whereas they solidified their reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">It broke out tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents them in the same league such as unique athletes such as Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilit has dominated the last three years its sportswear - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mix of ambition and precision that the Olympiad of 1984 Mary Lou Retton from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It was a final exam in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas return, would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American, Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace themselves, after they have won gold and silver in the retail majority of women at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bilit took the first medal on Tuesday, while she was at the farewell party of the team-coordinator, Martha Karolyi served as a sign-for.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bilit existed, during their long stretch on the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her ground exercises - which included its typical tumbling pass - is adapted to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother was discovered during a schooling in the gymnasium, in which Boorman trained, became the power.</seg>
<seg id="25">In the summer of 2013, it has been no more lost, a winning series that will keep as long as it wishes to be.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina introduced through two sets, deceives the image.</seg>
<seg id="27">Schwebeys and Bodenturns - in which Bilit holds the world title - loud.</seg>
<seg id="28">They went back up with 15,433 on the balance sheet - and sat down with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced them gently when she expected her Endergum - a pure form of formality - and tears from Bilit shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision they once described in their collection-book, became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The achievement of Raismans was a vengeance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medals in a bass player went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team-capitalists had been named by the Americans "Oma," a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground practice she threw out to the audience of Kusshields, blown away by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">What it concerns, so he quickly developed a whole new meaning in the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the police report that were published on Thursday two women and a 12-year old girl killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial attack of Phoenix, while they were talking in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fire weapon, while he stood on the passenger side of the car, and then fled with another vehicle, is in the report to read.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a robber, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, who took possession of an adult victim.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Polizeisprecher from Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investigators would deny a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">Altogether, predominantly in Hispanic dwellers were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," divided Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspects has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissant from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to conclusions that the attacks are linked to and by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of their injury and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died still on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness shared the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the sliding on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-times murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That's what I present myself under the Women's olympic rule in the Turtles and that is more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all I have been in the Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three turnerinside, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, which inspirational for many young girls of other skin-colour.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jüdin is and Madison Kocian, the Catholics, makes every pride.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among the female Turnerinside was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympics in winning and the Americas.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez how they expected, but masterful Gymastics delivered.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American female, who won gold medal at an individual multi-ring event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We are experiencing the tip of this sport, but you do not see sneak classes across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie smote all the same way as Aly and Madison in order to create it in the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "last Five," because the next Olympics will only have four turbines in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality looks so that turbines are a more expensive sport and Turner can be maintained primarily in private turnouts which will be maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel and hotel expenses (for the trainers and their turers and families). the list can continue to continue.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these turnouts are in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these verses the Turner will receive her whole training and that is a expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer by Laurie Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started with the turings.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to be inspired to the congregations of innumerable, young girls, which are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a better and easier to access sports.</seg>
<seg id="23">I was founded my turnout of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">We offer free and affordable turers in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality turers who earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turne develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long advantages for health as well as for training and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this squad that bring thousands of young girls interested in the turmoil and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by the Holes of the olympic team Congolds and thank you for so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveler drew its immune system and Würgereflex in a serious examination - by lowering some of the hardened and eceldest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and tour-author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shot his course at the Piccadilly Circus, a sinking knob and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the demise of each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and to show us what he is going to be in.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filtered under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought, the dishwashers of a traininlets that has been used by thousands of others may be totally agonizing, but in fact they are in a kitchen rinse more poor bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestine bacteria and his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left, what he stretched, more than a bad dessert in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright has been known to test the resilience of his intestine by travelling through the world and ate himself as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to train stations to flush crabs of toilets, the task set its immune system definitely below a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film, he told: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, the earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was sure to meet his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test-line showed a Luminomever of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, Luminomemann is fresh washed hands less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to cut off after their Luminomever was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio made the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "this comes the worst thing I have spent in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing smarter than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will nothing angled here because it is indoors here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company dedicated Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactobacillus and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestine bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explained the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy brainstormings so that we said "Lass us Ian calling us."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking only about products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had some of the things I have relied upon it, just like the ecelective Russian toilet that will be shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to leak her and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty goodies in film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by 2015 associated 84 percent of all respondents milin bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain included lactobacillus.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination panels: who does not purchase soundplates?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you write to the commentary, to oversaw him under the pseudonym of non-allleensamic men with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplier of Schallplatten is not attributable to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who bought recently a record are all foresight after between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer group.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older records are more likely to keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a message report on TV, I would follow the camera, while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and wildly, before I stand up, my hands keep and something determinedly like: "so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly located at its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera out for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such transactions and try to evaluate their age and vegetable by watching.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55 I from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) to Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle age, a woman, probably around the 20) succession, is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, ask me?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I really appreciate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">This record, above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not sent to him home), kicks the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and again to buy items that he sold, when he was young and pleite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, where I was probably something to be young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who are buying the plates, more introverted and would like to spend alone time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers he meets on the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who heard about the comeback and have prompted themselves to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the talks I have led, people usually have escaped their collection in 1998 or in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the disk of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that records are a soothing community of ingestures.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record-fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundplates, from objects, the happy Jugenderinnings.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of materialistic possessions as a kind of consolation," says WEZ.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is for me as collectors, and I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to engage spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like her social workers!" flutes an employee from a panel stack. "" "</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, they have not yet been heard.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found out that 41% possess a record player, which they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very concerned while I stroked by a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the reaction.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently here and said," I do not own record player, but I would like to buy a radio head record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it happens definitely.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-glass, less musical.</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older, who only come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has a sound hand dedicated almost a whole floor, has a bluff audience when I was going to purify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagejungs and women middle aged.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the preceding shops - Wild Beasts New synthesizers and sexcunter pop instead of experimental jazz are reconciled from loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them look quite lonely, but wet mental traumas are hard to be imagined if one stands next to someone 30 seconds long.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, runs around in the business for several minutes and regards the variety of the available plates.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more like a mannequin than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't earn much, therefore the collecting of records is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from one computer or another way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives with a lovely sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store by which is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the case, the jeans-hotspots, I watched a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a crosley turntables.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">Nobody sees them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that gives most of the luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my tutorials took place, that the results of YouGov vote, let them at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records who exist in reality, discovers and in online forencia.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or office.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with safety not with strolling through record stores of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they avoid the rigid look of an uncanny, 30-year old moderator, that rises over the shoulders of none of the middle aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the finals on Thursday evening to a corrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in the handling, side-stepping, aftermath, line run and roher force to win gold - their first Olympiamedaille of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was versed by the not so bad TrostAward of the silver medal - Britain's fourth day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they smote New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals.</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of it, Fiji on this form had a 15-man team in a funeral form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal at his neck: Fijis Chef trainer Ben Ryan, the former Chief for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind him.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost under Ryan every game with Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This strap is going to do, but the progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and allowed the attacks GbS from fun exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winner went 5-0 to the top as Osea Kolinisau in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai also added another attack from the right corner, which he turned over.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly pronounced the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">An excellent tresses of Mitchell never stops the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it has Fiji on Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touchdown and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the re-trial and there was still over a minute season... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presided by another weak Tacklings of the GB team and rushed to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion took an 29-0 to the rest.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still daerated.</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB was introduced basic changes to the half time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, what was good for the conditions of the first half period, until Joshua Tuisova ran out after a brilliant stopplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game ran long in favor of the South Caucasus, whose fans sangen, Flags and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame continued the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The pfiff erts, the Fijis umarmten and GB kicked laid down in the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier in the day, Fiji Japan was defeated in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain urged South Africa in a crisp half-final match of the race - Great Britain conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton crossed the line with an impressive footing and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant surprise, Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured profits - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no emotinaleres gold than in those games and that wants to be.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve that enter the story, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their goldenem moment on the Estonian da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though it was only the Beiden who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allotted when she filed for the second Olympiagold in two without a tax maid, the first women in the history of British Sports, which showed such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Your dominance was absolute, after all its 39.ter unwritten application, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant Athos who glides over the surface with the elegance of sponges, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the Ruins, a battalion will contribute to wild advances which make the difference and it was no one assistant as the trainer who was not able to survive this day when cancer was diagnosed at all.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, who is operable and that did they do.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not, it spreads everywhere from.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a rather horrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was treatment early 2014, out of season, could start what the interruption occurred to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">The rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the intraceability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-free morning to talk something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning that was as captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a bet in Afghanistan, said "I was this week an emotional wreck. that's maybe something extremely, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It just repeated how much I mean how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive boy goes to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have a better person for exercising or a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no races lost in the last five years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Singen-URSEL Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher studies, she caped the thread of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>

<seg id="7">Most sensing singers in chorus and share with like-minded the pleasure of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, senior can establish social contacts and cultivate them.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures solve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made URSEL Kipp in her choir:" "" "Come and organize themselves to be able to rely on the other and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who are calling its lungs regularly, is not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even though it is about getting the sound of the voice at age, Singen is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft für seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observed that singing or hearing of songs among older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and especially melodies, themselves deny themselves the sick people in long back events.</seg>
<seg id="19">At Singen the head is also called for special achievement, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone, practice so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that you learn by the Singen in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even the self-esteem is growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I am long for something, I will get better and watchful about me - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start with singing, there is so enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he means, little talent to have, betraying lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You do not sing alone - at least 50 singing people, who will hear when a sound goes off to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In the search of the suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">Sing someone from the acquaintances in a senior enchyma, you can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer insights on the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in a church choir, can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior enchantors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Anyone who does not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors will ask for help with interfering.</seg>
<seg id="35">Who desire has to sing should necessarily join a choir, betray Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something freeing - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolins</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is also, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are developing consistently and inevitably, a fast season between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the olympic torch itself would be a burning stab, which is irritated from the bracelet to the swimmers to the triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can not switch on TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in the queue in queue without over Simone Biles, Katie Lecover or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos to hear.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is still Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, which is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's warmed with grass, would certainly have been among these familiar names that were sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-being-tv advertising, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fetters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold.</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminated any event equal.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: airbrush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest, and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I might suggest modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolinjump has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it was in Sydney, the last 16 years has noticed that many that I had asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympics type.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the US sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, who managed it to the end-round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline resides a certain outdoor charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownschool as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a few enthusiasts.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never to ending clouds - but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, which combines two sports that are essentially united.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and must land a number of falling movements (rotating, heats and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to the official Olympiad after execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists must continue in their quest for gold faster, faster, upward and beyond, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and back, upwards and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They are not only hunting for the Ziellinie or the curwall, but also in the television transmission: the world or the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="28">The purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I myself consider using these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">This offers the trampoline a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forwards driving is not the destination.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she prt, apparently weightless like an astronomer, goes upwards, then down effortlessly back upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wrob in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant abolition of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition for the Olympic Games only can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and end-round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming for 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is the end-round as part of a afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to miss in general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the consciousness of consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and the objectivity of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Dooley awaits its way to air rining, new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight to break down?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid state of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last few months, protests against the government are coming to the country and in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people climbed up to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The response of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot at zig unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">Themselves in the run-well-being video about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, how safety people suggest young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN High Authority for Human Rights now demands an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is much appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently pursued the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison, or driven into the expanse of the wilderness.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in the Ethiopian region." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous grievances that cover all from the ground use to the stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a considerable election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a fight for these jagged, controversial line called for in June hundreds of lives.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades, which have been more or less forced in recent years to benefit turbulence and armed themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of imbiting after years of age are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems to be harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheap smartphones are becoming more frequent and improved the Internet services.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet-proxies that conceal where they are staying.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have given that they gathered themselves to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia is mainly Christian doves, in the politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are living and living in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing just.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated unfair by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray that constitute about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, was until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as the tactical genius, a man who could think about the corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly vulnerable to use early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to edit opponents and make them harmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime is lacking in this fundamental skill," "" "Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected relatively undue for reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ireland, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia was such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands against elections were protested, which were deceived and subsequently stolen by the government according to claims by the government.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids have been killed many protesters were killed, even though it was less than in the last months and that time of turmoil was relatively quickly past.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, Protestick in Gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray's shops, and the hatred of the Tigray is always practiced in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests of the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for poetry flights over the neighboring Somalia, even though they recently dealt with that she has closed this base.</seg>

<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump attempted to allay the final controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by announcing that his repeatedly repeated contention, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group of Islamic State, not seriously.</seg>

<seg id="4">It also brings his collaborators who strive to take him during an eventful phase in protection, to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not be meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the clearance of an election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump had made reference to the statement on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really didn't intended to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he is simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the contrast to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken this statement by remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him, the Republican presidential didactic wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticism prasselt down to Mr. Trump as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign due to expiration changes on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speaking to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>

<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has given sarcasm already to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism on himself, when he said the Russians should appear Mrs. Clinics Emails, but later he said "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language limits in politics and then return to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then if necessary," according to how the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication-sexist who observed the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he is very cleverly enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of resolves the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has taken an even other sound, as its refractures are further backward.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was released on Friday, showed a guided tour with great advantage over the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative remarks, he frequently accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humour false.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is strengthened the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal co-bearing into the uncomfortable situation, to be standing independent of how provocative may also be his statements.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps of prominent intercessors, gave great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrisk is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland usually come only in winter to finish.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination on board.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to the present day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie will only get up with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Damely swims of Greenland along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is at average only 1,220 feet far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates on satte 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed, half as fast as a robot.</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of slowness shaped lifestyle seems to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science "at any rate of a Greenland, which could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "comments Alexander Scheuenlighin from the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means for vertebrates a world record." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionists assumed a long time that Greenland are stony stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only absent the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grönlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water-temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Through the lifestyle of Greenland researchers researchers know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time lupin measurements they when they sold six animals in front of Svalbard six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a robot, another had swallowed the jaw-knob of a young ice-bears.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt for sleepy animals or patrol, at the bottom of the ice sea and look for Kadaver, which are from higher water layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a concatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method of sharks of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises even before the birth of sharks, which contained in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsencore.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as an atomic weapon-attempt larger amounts of this radioactive carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third-length animal with 220 centimeters in length, the linsenders took a small surplus of carbon-14 out of the atomic weapon, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland had normal carbon-14 quantities in their linsensed, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed a 493 centimeters long Greenland an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters can even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females only then get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now, the researchers were able to assign the length to the age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the Geschlechtsreither and his age has been determined with 156 years, Greenland can be evident at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in freezing waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland, in whose bacon at the neck was inserted a 120 year old harpostage, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures often the organism of the animals live on sparkle.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, by which the animal is built.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram mouse is therefore much bigger than in a grammar elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous and should concentrate as early as possible as many descendants as possible," explains the evolutionologist Scheuin.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="18">It was simply incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datkslau: so perfide compresses their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmer of compressing malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful in this process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware defense specialists in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly several times of a attack with blackboard software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany just 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a groomware-blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their erpresser software according to the observations of Malwarebytes with attack on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially softening solvent is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we currently observe a startling fast evolution of the pollutant software," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "World" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the culation software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only privately, private use the goal, but the change to company attacks took place in the past few months quickly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware is working after a simple pattern: once on the computer of a victim, it searches for unlong changed files such as Word-, excel- or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the prespresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of Cryptonutrition Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where with private users the personal photo database is at stake, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly higher the damage falls when a ransomware proposes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German firms involved in sales by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany many hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we say the victims always: paying not, it only promotes the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of the firms pay, their data will get back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a stalemate in the operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study the security researchers of F-secure the utility areas and the contact with the presses are examined and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat how they can pay by Bitcoin, direct access websites or decode for free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if individuals solves to payments of a few hundred Euros, companies need to negotiate hard and five digit sums have to pay for their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware detection, the hackers explains more professional and share the work, explains safety-perched Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-providers Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within one week."</seg>
<seg id="28">Probable it is however, that it is about three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their damage software then in the form of a software module to the actual presses.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits were created by the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is a customization tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The presses are then looking for further hackers in order to distribute the freshly caught software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set of a criminals and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per intolerated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually instruct the criminals then spammer with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that are better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT responsible in the Malwarebytes survey will trust Ransomware using file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators are instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this way, the damage potential, according to the type of data is still a much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">The perpetrators can also take entirely new goals on the Internet of Things in the future.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrated security researchers how they could get a control of the Internet connected thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the selfission of a so-block heating could be quite a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators are then blocking an entire production road in a factory in the future, Ransomware might be a subject in the industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one heated everlasting around, at night one is awake after spending hours, in the morning there is much more to think about sleep in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about a quarter of adults sleeping disorders and over ten percent feel frequent or permanent as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many different causes underlie, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, executive board member of the German Society for Sleeping research and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand among them is the Insomnie, so an inhalation and a sleeping-compulsive disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just that, many people feel as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, Board member of the German household doctor with practice in the lower-Saxon varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeves are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can organic, mental or behaviouring factors, but also medicines are stuck.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping-compulsive expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is especially common in a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors are different.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who for example has a band shoot, can lie bad, wakes up every two to three hours and begin to ponderously, about everyday problems and worries, gives weeß an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleeves to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Who does not sleep well over a month for a month in at least three nights per week and the day is affected, should go to the doctor, betray weeß.</seg>
<seg id="19">The drawbacks can look quite differently: one is abstained, tired, unslept, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical ailments such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To alleviate the sleep-compulsive disorder, it is important to find out its causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a treatment options, among other things, behavioural changes occur, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional and most for two weeks - inquestion.</seg>
<seg id="22">Exuberant dormitory has hardly been accentuated in Germany, "Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitory of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, one should look at sleeping problems first at the surgeon, betray weeß.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified up with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For the examination in the dormitories of medical professionals, for example with snoring with airiness, in case of disease-fatigue, in sleeeds or if you do not find the cause of a deplorable disorder, Fietze explained.</seg>
<seg id="27">Actually, you do not need to prepare for an inquiry.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just do not make a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling, one gets to his normal time in bed.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nasal lasses, a chest strap, and a antennae on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people get a handle of the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of pitches on which one can bet for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Weeß counts on: regular sleeping and rising times, not too long in bed, don't sleep on the day, don't watch TV for sleeping, alcohol mily and at night not look at the watch - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible property company Friedrichshain is called in the last weeks however preferred with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the inhabitants of rental contracts, on the ground floor are still spaces occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Especially at the Berlin interior Henkel in the beginning of the year, the police had spoken several times for a hard approach to the police against the project, the area called "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy.</seg>
<seg id="8">After 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been vacated, patrolling the police three weeks long official statements according to 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, spersed parts of the road and kept visitors to enter the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, renovated construction workers on behalf of the unknown landowners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13th July, a Berlin Board of Directors decided that clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers went under the jubel of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street works peaceful: parents go strolling with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about preäti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left force is not the main community of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs here three children, are especially generated by police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the care of rising prices and rectification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound according to a pine tree, which has a majority of policeman on the left of an Andalusian left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior and the police are open between domestic and their neighbours so obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which also today has a lower averaged in comparison with the rest of the city and has high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also home-occupied and the born-born projects are for a long time ago: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer street near the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer has been vacated under large police officers in a regulator road, many of the projects were legalized in the rig and were still inhabited by the people today occupied by 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and the electoral liner from around the world: with them now people from GDR-times and former house occupied their jaw.</seg>
<seg id="21">This also has been noticeable in the rents that since 2009 has risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newly built buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one realizes them in the worshipped slices, or freshly knitted facades that were buried with color-exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One of the reasons that not all neighbours are considered to be a problem, be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: criminal offences such as body violation shall affect statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most important part of the criminal offences are made of Saxony, which tends to take place more of the newly built houses and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 years, there cannot be any talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is more important: people in 94 are their neighbours that have been determined not.</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rigaer already longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a crime point, on the contrary: "here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was deliberately drawn into the Rigahe street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">Therefore it was also so important to her that the inhabitants left their street: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the explanation of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the street will continue to take away: through reverberless new buildings in former buildings that are pushing the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is ultimately the property of ownership, which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well involved" "", "she says." ""</seg>

<seg id="35">But what should we do, if any one never listens?</seg>
<seg id="36">It sets out on all sides of frustration, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For those who are scattered abroad, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the jaw.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">Besides, she is Social-worker from the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle the refugees for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogical in supports the team of managing agate in Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees himself as a contact for all actors: refugees, colleagues, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the brightening Wollmilchsau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">As a result, some - fewer nuts, rather than looking for a variety of challenges - meant as the management wanted to write the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">She was looking for a administrative unit with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just an enlightening Wollmilchsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Most of all, it is about organization, working with the local people and also behind the scenes, as well as power value.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been in part for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 per cent spot on three years expired.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehr- and full-time actors are supported.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers in Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A heavy problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting flees, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the municipalities are responsible for connecting the municipalities." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to place the refugees in their own or registered residential rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Federal Environment Agency to commune and jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as a very difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto there are no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far you do not have it yet, be reliant on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be erased, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine Client and Annika deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">Besides a firm spell, it is practicable, educational places, school courts, A-Euro-Jobs and painstakeholder activities for refugees and migrants who need to be vulnerable or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help homework, do non-profit work - and this motivates and very tidy, as Annika deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community is leading to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But work does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a fixed structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of relatives.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also jump here administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful for example, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "" "" "who eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach anyone, should not work and be useless, who will never be integrated." ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">Problem: there are also problems, says customer honestly, "people, at all at all goes." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent incident are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine Customer really clearly," "" "what could be naive to be naive" "". "a Restrisiko could be and doesn't want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents also be subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks put them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and honorary official site must be held in the area and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants should come to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">This is clear to answer this question, is the politics.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not there yet, where we would go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher products are already pending before being able to reintegrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
