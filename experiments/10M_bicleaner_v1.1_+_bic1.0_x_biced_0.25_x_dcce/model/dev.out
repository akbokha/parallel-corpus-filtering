Obama receiving a Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as backing Tehran &apos;s destabili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but in the encounter it is important about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ embr@@ acing two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the long @-@ term settlement @-@ making of Israel and casts off a burning will in the peace process .
thanks to the Obama &apos;s s@@ wor@@ shi@@ ed deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has further deterior@@ ated .
in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial debate at the invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US congress held partly as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the election of the im@@ pending election in Israel .
in a call for Professor , who shot his girlfriend
in a call of an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon told me with a little funny voice of the police , he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb it was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; is still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house were the officials of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written mention that was kno@@ cked to a white block : &quot; I am sorry I couldn &apos;t do , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that arose in two on @-@ line courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , signed up already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he raised a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
he said that he did this f@@ ateful emergency time after it .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life , while the police arrived him .
a day after the shooting at the university , the students and faculty are forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what he motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state were , as was what students and collaborators , who knew him , helped to draw an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers .
students said that they were on his lessons .
the police of Gau@@ le , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he did not have history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
Schmidt himself mentioned in a book written by his written book in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both worked in the department of social sciences and history , whose teacher has 17 members including , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some high@@ s to be problematic .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb , he said , he also seemed a little &apos; excited and nervous , &quot; as if something had been wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb before the Delta State University had asked for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he was subject to only two online courses .
recent changes in the employment policies of the University signi@@ fied that the promotion , for the delay had worked so hard for it , no guarantee for an automatic way to work as a Assistant Secretary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; univers@@ ally President William La@@ for@@ ge said he know nothing of a clash between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions we cannot answer in question .
after the flight out of the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Track while he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ans@@ as imports .
before it could be arrested and k@@ ic@@ ked off with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lam@@ m went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
he began his work at the university in 2009 with 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught con@@ j@@ ec@@ ations and ped@@ agog@@ y .
he graduated in spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together by joint friends .
she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach the guitar playing for some years .
he was then the woman @-@ sho@@ al at that time .
all the girls earn , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and alleg@@ ations were obviously quite some time together .
in the call , &quot; I said &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no judgment of a marriage .
they had a dog called Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick building that was adjacent to a ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police told that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were retired 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met him , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both in the summer time three years ago .
later they played together one way or another .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , which worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes maintenance coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak @-@ lit Bar near Gau@@ le , said he &apos;s lying down and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night in September last time after Lamb of his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ cups had ended in a spar@@ se public .
there was no sign that something was not cor@@ rupted .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the show@@ rooms and we were together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
Schmidt , the Red Professor , headed the first semester seminar and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English @-@ professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was the president of his Brotherhood and the students committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people took part in the delta State campus , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , staff , students and members of the community in a candle service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the mili@@ tia , as the universal Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be added on Wednesday at the end of Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io soli@@ ds reported from Cleveland , Mississippi .
Associ@@ ated Press author Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to resist that the police have now claimed that he did not recall once his wife , and that Lamb in his notebook should be called his wife , but there is no indication that the two got married .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was remarkable for personal reasons also .
&quot; we sat at the theater for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is next to me empty and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts and it comes in my mind that I can be a sim@@ ulated drawing and a measuring distance away from being in a date with the princess of Wales .
&quot; Back in Time &quot; , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presented interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had a premiere performance over 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ str@@ it@@ tig on the biggest journey of the journey , which was ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN chief says , there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General of K@@ i @-@ Moon says his response to Russia &apos;s military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and engage in an inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference held on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member states of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the edge of the Council meeting held this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ plor@@ es that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers will make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an challenged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they have proven in achieving a nuclear issue with Iran .
8 survey levels , which show that Donald Tr@@ ump will take seriously .
some tried to play it as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks with surveys down , it has ( still ) does not work .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump will run in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s .
naturally it is still early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts say that at this time in 2011 the Per@@ rin leadership was given to the open @-@ rising tide , none of which won &apos;t even have one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups such as Je@@ b &apos;s Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative Economic Coun@@ ts Club for Growth now recognise cuts and start to let their dollar flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values , indicating that the real estate itself is not just a temporary phase :
fi@@ umps and Belie@@ ve @-@ values have turned out by 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ st in the middle of June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans were positively influenced by the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l .
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August 52 percent were 52 percent .
now six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early countries .
in I@@ owa H@@ inn@@ ip@@ i@@ ac @-@ tuning in I@@ owa has found that 60 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the G@@ OP @-@ voters G@@ OP would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week we said 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be either &apos; amazed or &apos; satisfied if Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son brings about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same above Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio , having only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters tell you that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied or &quot; angry , &quot; if je@@ b Bush , the Favor@@ ite of the E@@ stab@@ lis@@ hment , the candidate .
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees Tr@@ umping temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish Republi@@ can voters believe that the real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament to a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is in the first ancest@@ or of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality to Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ ot@@ ip@@ i@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 per cent that he does not have the personality to execute effectively his term , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House p@@ asse , so ABC / post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they expose her nest @-@ hat@@ s , Republi@@ can voters tr@@ ump for real .
if they are asked , who most likely won the G@@ OP @-@ nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet .
that is a change since the time when four of ten came out of their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : G@@ OP @-@ voters do not have the crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans were thinking that Rick &apos;s winning the nom@@ ination would only win 28 % to the final candidate .
nevertheless , a large number of G@@ OP @-@ voters are seen as plau@@ sible campaign .
even when the re@@ public@@ ans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everybody .
some experts suggest that the split box is likely to contribute to Tr@@ umping leadership , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , g@@ ump the multiple support harv@@ ested .
in front of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points lead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , above Walker , 15 points , before E@@ b Bush 19 points and finally from edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ in @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would score the entrepren@@ eur of 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have formed their opinion .
a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the elec@@ torate , the g@@ ump will support , say that they have set their votes firmly .
of course , a lot can happen to change this , and no one can truly say to change the opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open to other candidates .
nevertheless , the pump is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they are consistent with Tr@@ ump in the topic of immigration .
since then Donald Tr@@ ump did in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum point in the public discourse in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tr@@ ump &apos;s essential Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will be abol@@ ished from the Republi@@ can party and will be ashamed of new @-@ oriented efforts .
but after the new ABC / post pol@@ l from Monday to say six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans , that they are consistent with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
as long as immigration stays in the spotlight , it will appear to do Donald Tr@@ ump as well .
the frustration for the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
at Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , accounts for half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly by their out@@ sider status .
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ g@@ ags from ABC / Post , they preferred to have a political out@@ sider as someone with the experience experience .
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in I@@ owa meets two weeks ago that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Republi@@ can in Congress to be dis@@ satisfied with 54 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive locations of Germany
here the Hob@@ oo@@ king is located the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea of North Sea .
in the street , a square metres of a car park at the average cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects is natural , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the trial - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows what special La@@ ws cost an square meter in the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student residence in Munich are not really low .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ locations , however , the cost comes as pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider angels &amp; Völ@@ s has released a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square rates in wind@@ di@@ zing high places .
there are several hundred thousand Euros available - per square meter , well marked .

by the way : Munich is here close to the top .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ Dream@@ start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
tw@@ atter scor@@ er in Pir@@ ro : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just a run .
a happy match to Thomas Müller served the FC Bayern den way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran &apos; s .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have brought a dream start to FC Bayern in Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Piraeus .
the team of Trainer PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their play play in the Champions League at the Greek record studio Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers double pack ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol people ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves to 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth team &apos;s success was supposed to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take off the Hen@@ k pot@@ t to Munich .
Müller received a champion in the Champions League for the Bavarian @-@ headed Cap@@ acity of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who left one as a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the world master .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate , &quot; said Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m before the game at the Kar@@ ak@@ k@@ akis @-@ Stadium in front of the game at 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hottest fans - and the Munich accord @-@ held word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated thought , without shiny .
Pir@@ ate had won his latest six home games in the top class , including against nam@@ e@@ ful clubs as Manchester United , At@@ lé@@ bio Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also stum@@ bled here at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bayern , in seven European ac@@ et du@@ els with Greek teams un@@ defeated , did not want to be the next victim .
they were courage@@ ously , with their offensive efforts , but often to van@@ ish @-@ alone to work .
the attacks have often been introduced by cre@@ eping on Lin@@ ks@@ abroad Douglas Costa , which rarely se@@ ded to the former Braunschweig region of Omar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had no more luck on the right than his f@@ lange took out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of them had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye Brown struck the head of the Pole by the line ( 26 . ) .
then on the direct delivery , the Tor@@ wart Roberto stood by the knee ( 3@@ 5 ) .
although the Bayern has moved its familiar game , Pi@@ re@@ aus could set the needle .
at the door @-@ keepers , Manuel Neu@@ er , he was a promise .
so about , when he had a shot of ide@@ ye via the rat ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola sent a four @-@ chain family with David Al@@ aba in the centre near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back at the squ@@ ad , sat at first out .
the Hero @-@ hero was given a green light just after the final training , he said Christopher Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he wants to make something different from it , this is a vi@@ cious . &quot;
also during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) .
Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ meters there was still a dr@@ one .
in front of the game he had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle &apos;s stadium .
after a smaller group of partly supposed Bayern @-@ fans in their audience @-@ block clearly prov@@ okes the supporters of hosts pir@@ kar@@ es with words and ges@@ tures , ass@@ esses the security forces and went with impact against the Mün@@ chner followers .
at least a Bayern fan was bre@@ ached in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth
who smo@@ kes , sw@@ aying not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts an Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term experiment next .
the good news : at ren@@ oun@@ cement , the risk is fast .
smokers have a clearly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ F ) in Potsdam .
compared to the smo@@ ker there was the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ matur@@ ely , around the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
root causes for tooth decay to be car@@ ies and inflammation of the tooth fl@@ esh@@ s , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ F .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the relationship between smoking and tooth loss therefore refer to common infl@@ amed g@@ ums with smokers .
not clarified , to how much smoking even increases the risk for tooth decay .
people who listened to smoking could reduce their risk but within a short period of time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take ten years until the haz@@ ard had to go back to the level of non @-@ smokers who explained the dust of Thomas Die@@ tri@@ ch from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smoking , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the living time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and results in our knowledge even to a good dental health to the high age .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of fl@@ essness have been reported .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increase the risk of early tooth failure .
the new long @-@ term study cir@@ cl@@ ed the findings .

EU Commission is propos@@ ing a new court in disputes over the TTIP
at the dis@@ ruption of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlantic Trade F@@ TA TTIP has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system .
the most controversial private arbitration institutions to dispute between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a transpar@@ ant system that corresponds to a much more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that bre@@ wing citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swedish din has recently issued the proposal as a European negotiating positions in the US &apos;s free trade talks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans for re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings con@@ cre@@ tely do con@@ cre@@ tely the EU @-@ States and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new office .
they are to be made up of equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries .
it is for the first time a second instance .
it would allow it to elev@@ ate against jud@@ g@@ ments .
until now , the procedures involved each other on an arbitr@@ ator , an objection to their jud@@ g@@ ments , were not given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion last months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system have not trusted in terms of fairness and fairness , &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to go home to an international investment court in the long term .
the disputes between Chinese companies and the EU states could also be clarified there for example .
the state @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) primarily are considered to be one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbitr@@ ators are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel , above the companies reimbur@@ sement to tax payers , national laws out@@ mo@@ l or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements supported Anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act , the Commission &apos;s proposals are insufficient .
the EU was critici@@ zed especially that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German econom@@ ist Secretary of Matthias Mach@@ n@@ ig ( SPD ) compet@@ ed his plans for a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered significant points when re@@ forming significant points , the Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel is worked out in the spring with other EU ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

delicacies Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Ste@@ vens was sitting on the stage in Cologne &apos;s Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to it is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which has recorded the in@@ timi@@ dating fol@@ ks@@ y of the picturesque US state of Michigan with fil@@ z@@ sti@@ ft .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken from Ste@@ vens lecture .
he relates to several places that he always records on the map , which he will report about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate songs .
where they have ar@@ isen and how it looks like there , in his homeland .
since then , Ste@@ vens is a wonderful creative one .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; clever songs that harmon@@ iously set themselves together very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can dri@@ fting at any time into the great op@@ ul@@ ent .

super@@ bor@@ dering ideas and stylis@@ tical fin@@ esse .
the album climb@@ s into the American bili@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of the influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , Ste@@ vens serves then for &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) and extensive electronic compositions .
this sixth and decent studio album is still wide orches@@ tr@@ ated , but lab@@ eled by programmed sequences or Be@@ ats and plays with a variety of effect and hall .

without having a word to the audience , the group plays an excellent musician through the broad @-@ enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience you hear , the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; op@@ ul@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and one could essentially throw away the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; disk &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut on the premiere of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ te was expected to eager@@ ly anticip@@ ates the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension
the new Labour Chairman of Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n was his debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister and he first spoke with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of its six @-@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance from the media was likely to be examined and taken over by the Labour MPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could jump over a few sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ bi@@ n &apos;s guide , because she comes after his appointment as a member of the grey cabinet and his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Chairman , held on Tuesday during the singing of the national hy@@ mn ple@@ a during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ isms of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and stands at the center of several front @-@ sides stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ te &apos;s decision to not sing the national hy@@ mn , paying attention to himself
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man told Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dis@@ respectful of silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he had recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Chairman of the Labour Chairman , he said to sing the National An@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a sixth of the Hungarian party was originally supported as leaders .
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences would be st@@ ack@@ able in the Labour &quot; position , &quot; by Mr Cor@@ ying statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation of wins .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour amendments put forward to remove the whole idea of a total restriction .
hours later , Mr Smith , the Labor @-@ Labor and R@@ ent Ministers confirmed that the party &quot; was very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans , limit the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chairman , David Cameron , since he &apos;s T@@ ory leader , has over the last decade on the Disp@@ atch counter @-@ Box in parliament .
the Labour Chairman , who promised a different policy approach , says he has &quot; crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the opening @-@ round of the Prime Minister has to confront , and that he will refrain both &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viol@@ ability &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the fight with resistance and instead to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadows of economic ministries in him will be represented when he does not participate - for instance , Mr Cameron is on the move abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues sometimes grab the Word and that he John Ber@@ ries , the speaker of the Under@@ house , addressed to discuss the problem .
when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron told that he &apos;s been linked to the Prime Minister of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theatre &quot; which often associated with the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he adm@@ its that he has failed .
when she was sent to television first in 1990 , the frac@@ ture with the Prime Minister was seen as a leader of the possession of a leader and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a caric@@ ature and so far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound desc@@ ends through acceler@@ ating growth in the United Kingdom
the pound has climbed up to data resulting in the growth growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the B@@ ot@@ sz@@ iel SA@@ BM@@ iller today .
between May and July the result was increased without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period last year .
this percentage was for 2009 the quick@@ est , and inv@@ ests in@@ estim@@ ations at the time of a interest rate .
the pound was increased by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was scr@@ apped up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index joined a increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6,@@ 22@@ 9,@@ 21 .
the SA@@ BM@@ iller was the excellent share of the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ vals AB W@@ Be@@ v was made .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were encouraged according to encouraging messages from the competition group for luxury goods A@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Ju@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - returns to growth again .
shares of Glen@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining triumph@@ s said that he has taken $ 2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decline by 4.@@ 3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his estimate for the company rating .
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the sports@@ wear company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages may endan@@ ger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more power in the pockets of the potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this buying power will be the higher labor power in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less extra jobs .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanying Justin yesterday .

who are it ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber himself did not .
this is anyway out@@ going .
for the advertising in the fre@@ ad of the Super@@ bow@@ ls , he cas@@ ed three million , a two year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company . ül@@ sten many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account .

if Justin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you &apos;ll be amazed at the wind@@ shield .
more than 100 million people should have explo@@ its .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
others say , Bie@@ ber should be the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album in November should follow , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings the Leb@@ ard to the potato @-@ d@@ inger idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
we are both - and in the Pot@@ el@@ d@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger D@@ iss@@ land@@ owners Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch potato , &quot; Dra@@ ke &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ters and flesh were put together on a mirror .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him to a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he acci@@ dentally seen on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , in his shop turns out a barbecue that has been equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ ha@@ y says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea has in the meantime had to enter the turn@@ around at the Patent Office in Munich meanwhile .
at the same time , according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as pre @-@ use patterns .
how much meat and how much potatoes in the mirror contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding comes well with its customers .
Met@@ als will start the lack of privacy and the campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ an attack
the metal is trying to protect the Ig@@ A branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a non @-@ lack campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepar@@ es the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ als and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets can strengthen its relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream media and marketing via the soci@@ alistic media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A @-@ traders and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as Eis@@ ler S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ shops , and shop@@ keepers , the remaining tickets for the South Australian football matches to loyal customers .
it is expected to collect more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor are running through its annual financial sector strategy .
there is a lot in the game as South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of the Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ cargo business and can generate higher profits as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ical provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers reported a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to roughly 14 percent in Eastern Europe .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets will take some five percent of the food market in these two countries , and will take all actors , but mainly self @-@ requ@@ is@@ ers sales .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath is estimated by Morgan Stan@@ ley that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer could lose $ 500 million revenue per year and a met@@ to 250 million $ by end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches within SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in every market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on met@@ a &apos;s high fixed @-@ base could cost Met@@ cash around € 13 million against interest and taxes , &quot; Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath .
at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan was found that Ig@@ A @-@ Le@@ ad are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in the food and grocery store will decrease 4.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2.0 % in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , won in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ als will likely disappear within a decade .
metal ref@@ uses to react to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of cash with Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s last week has made contact .
IG@@ As market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s food and food stores , which is about 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A @-@ retailer , has been in operation for 43 percent since 2012 is reflecting operating pressure on turnover and margins .
the wholes@@ aler comes back and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to increase sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ on@@ ths with hundreds of products each week at exactly the same and Ig@@ A retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of home @-@ label foods .
met@@ a &apos;s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ table and loading programs will be added to El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return for the first time in four years to come back to profit .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis is supported by president of the Australian tennis courts Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves praise more than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise than criticism for his own conduct .
Kok@@ kin@@ akis , the younger director of talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; by the in@@ famous examination of C@@ yrus with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ RIN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spotlight .
in a fier@@ y qualifying game at Cincinnati thereafter , Kok@@ kin@@ akis , and his opponent Ry@@ an Harrison , had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , while Harrison had hit Hiatamadl , and I should hit the child . &quot;
while he was most recently seen how he collap@@ sed a tennis rac@@ ket after a cr@@ amp@@ f had failed to wage a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was defended by Heal@@ y .
the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth , for second place in the see@@ ker from Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I have rather conquered , is the fact that after my view interest would be a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a rac@@ ket because he lost because of a fight against in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a rac@@ ket from frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around you , he has a great family around them , and I believe it was a little too strictly treated .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well respected , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and well @-@ engine@@ ered young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits .
Heal@@ y also assisted the decision , Kyr@@ gios to take into account the important decision @-@ making decisions , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision , &quot; as the right for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to come back as a long @-@ term being part of the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the check@@ boxes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kyr@@ gios &#93; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was very quick to climb , who made people like fe@@ ather and Mur@@ ray . he desc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves to assist him in giving him the consequences of his actions . some time outside the spotlight , I consider it appropriately , and it is best for the team and it is best for him .
Europe refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency relief , closes the border , holds refugees back
Hungary explains the emergency and bol@@ ted the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed on the border , as hundreds of migrants responded to in a no man &apos;s @-@ country mand@@ ates and Serbian civil servants re@@ acted .
the people who have fled before violence broke down for an unknown period in a country strip on the road between the two controls on the states and erected tents , and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ate came to .
as a police helicopter over them moved , the migrants &apos; openings the border ! &quot; and sm@@ iled ins@@ ults against the Hungarian authorities .
some meadows from protest food and water back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would withdraw from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in Prague , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica Dac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ block in a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels unable to agree a common immigration policy .
the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who arrived in the shr@@ ink of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would conclude that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria were calling for an extraordinary summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the countries of the continent .
but Hungary did not put his hopes for an amazing action from Brussels or its neighbors .
the emergency staff on Tuesday reached in two southern regions gave the authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they can dist@@ ort and accelerate roads and asylum proceedings .
the Hungarian Secretary of Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country should plan to build a bar@@ bed dra@@ in on his border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the land after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even Pr@@ in@@ mates were in the competition to create the bar@@ b@@ wire fence constructed between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a significant intensi@@ fication of the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insisted that most &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economies &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are looking for better lives and not war @-@ backs , claiming to protection - a view that is strongly in contradiction with other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall za@@ us that led the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lie higher prison guards for do@@ omed men businesses .
&quot; due to the situation that arose through the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains its state of affairs , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Cust@@ tan Kov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the southern town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
we say it very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree with the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press were heavily armed at the border with vehicles and dogs already for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security expert for Or@@ ban , said that authorities are 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated into the country .
they come from being embarrass@@ ed by the fence , they are now in law @-@ ahr@@ ing and being accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of rep@@ airing the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday , also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a wag@@ gon returned to bar@@ bed @-@ wire , to close the borders .
chaos re@@ bound the main border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , as the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and push a crowd to push themselves up there .
about 20 managed to come in , but thousands stayed outside .
a further group of migrants blocked the most important highway between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton was never hal@@ ted before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground in front of her .
Clinton has now stepped up the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the sel@@ ections ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ ander is second in second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , whether he is candidate for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the election .
more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters tell that it is too early to say that their opinion matters to what candidates they will support .
but at their choice he was more enduring than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders generated some of the gains .
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these proj@@ ections have less@@ ened .
their support in the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back .
Clin@@ ics &apos;s advantages of democratic voters in 50 years has p@@ oul@@ ded , and they are now on the same level .
but Clinton has a big lead to the older voters .
last month Clinton has been in front of S@@ anders with a two @-@ digit head with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the country @-@ elections can say that they were to support Clinton if they were nominated by the Party .
one fourth would support them with some circumstances and another 15 per cent would only support because it is the nom@@ inee as a candidate .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter she would be delighted .
while 48 per cent of democratic voters want to say that they still support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters with their peak , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if clinics can be asked in an open question why they want them is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman is president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best European candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
at Clin@@ tons supporters , your connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with problems and voters are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the Vice President dra@@ fted a potential for the presidential office on the commodity , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third thinks he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked by the elections , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the helm .
at Clin@@ ics followers say more than half of them that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of us .
decide pon@@ der not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton @-@ prot@@ ru@@ sion increases in front of S@@ anders , of 20 points with bi@@ den in competition on 30 points without him in the race .
five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this number of 78 per cent in the last month has fallen .
Bi@@ den is by far the second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nonetheless , on the question of what is more important to a candidate , please call democratic voters questions about voters .
similar to last month , there is no single country of democratic candidate or potential candidate to adopt these voters in the sel@@ ections .
the Democratic candidates and potential candidates perform good results in some important characteristics for voters in the sel@@ ections of their party .
maj@@ orities are Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership .
organic cuts with the three candidates best from honesty , whereas Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty per cent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trusted , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) but 27 percent do not think of him .
democratic voters of the sel@@ ections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ des , in accordance with their views .
in all of these measurements , approximately a quarter of democratic voters do not have an opinion of S@@ ander .
because questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton can continue to be submitted to a personal e @-@ mail address and one server during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters of the general elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions are not influenced by their opinions .
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans now are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is happy .
the public opinion of this was in March , shortly after the problem of light came , split .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their overall opinions of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still deterior@@ ated .
it is mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded as honest and trustworthy it is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trusted , eight percent fewer than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of the voting members do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the electoral code is also not tru@@ thful but not tru@@ stable .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes from leadership .
of the six people tested , be@@ g , car@@ son and Bush the best in honesty .
a majority regards itself rather than being honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have the opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the sel@@ ections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is close down the national survey by Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is located in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
on the two candidates , half of the vot@@ er support now lap@@ ses in the new survey , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters still support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News debate last month , around 27 % in the survey conducted by Tuesday .
but car@@ son f@@ lowed in the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received from demographic groups and is pen@@ alized under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ es@@ head , is defeated with Wis@@ ins to the Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , which is at the deepest fallen , and 10 % from the last month to now 2 % .
the former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , the former Gover@@ nor of Ark@@ ans@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ es and Florida @-@ Senator , Marco Ru@@ bio are situated in third position .
the error message by the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week shows that Car@@ son is increasing in the surveys - he puts at 19 % support for the re@@ public@@ ans behind the Tr@@ ump @-@ 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly before Car@@ son .
with a view to one of the last week &apos;s rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some sa@@ it@@ enh@@ ie@@ be for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ zed to place the m@@ umps in question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , last Saturday during a campaign appearances in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if we are measured only in the distance , there &apos;s a trip to the Mediterranean sea for bathing , even warm water .
a dip in North or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
there is no more to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the north and Baltic Sea in this week , shares the German Weather Service ( D@@ W@@ D ) .
this temperatures continue to take the Mediterranean in the Mediterranean : in the East it even comes up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is placed in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
5 members of the Brotherhood led to the death of a Bar@@ uch College
almost two years after a student in a sham@@ an@@ ous ritual in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , charges are filed against five persons .
members of New York &apos;s Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ PSI @-@ Le@@ aders attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a period of September 2013 and de@@ ported his transportation to the hospital , resulting in his death , shared the police .
officials said he had been loaded with connected eyes with a 30 Po@@ und back@@ pack full of sand , and repe@@ aled , while he tried to pass a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious around .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ PSI @-@ Le@@ aders did not call the emergency number 911 . after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
however , they had the time to conf@@ use D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , accus@@ ations Chris Wagner said on a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members , U@@ ten@@ si@@ lien began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood , basically over the by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning at his wounds .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g were repeated with stum@@ bled strength injury on head , h@@ ull and th@@ igh@@ s .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies down every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members due to murder .
twenty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal indictment and education of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to make it responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - this is sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold it to account , &quot; said Wagner on a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interests are coming , and the house@@ se will fall into the bed@@ bugs , are going to rise for bonds , and the economy will slip into a recession .
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the process .
a recession came up within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve on the raising of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in which the economy and the financial investments are responding .
therefore , representatives of the US Federal Reserve have so strongly stressed that investors should not concentrate on when to boost interest rates , but rather the period that is needed for norm@@ alization .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could notice that the whole excitement because of a interests may be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to the Customer .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level in order to lead to the se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to be many to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rates may make volati@@ le for a while .
once the increase hits , the influence is not as dramatic .
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that investments from 12 to 24 months after initial increase will be reflected , which perhaps once again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study to what happened after interest in the F@@ ed .
more specifically , the market is usually warmer in the past 35 years - about 14 per cent - on the road to interest , rather flat in the last six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a current analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , principal plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s published .
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the stock tends to occur later in the booster cycle and the return to decrease to decrease .
rec@@ essions include a fact of economic life , but Zin@@ tik is often encouraging them .
in the current case F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that weren &apos;t there before and that could accelerate a recession .
extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be the lowest score near its lowest score in the interests of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , 4@@ 2.1 % of GDP had only twice the nominal amount of GDP under 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few percent would expect this going to last and expect only 1.5 percent further for the third quarter .
&quot; interest &quot; interest in such an fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken all year into a interests of F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe the FO@@ MC may have approved an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading will only have an increase of 25 percent .
&quot; in our study all the revenues from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions are very quickly placed after the beginning of recovery &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was .
the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is so far 74 months .
the firm income was also volati@@ le since the market receives a interests , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the impact on bonds has been faster than when shares a strategic course .
on bonds , the ren@@ unci@@ ation seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle occurs .
at the end of the booster cycle the bond border falls immediately , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believes that the rise in the interest rates will result in bringing a closer connection between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , despite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ st at Schw@@ ab . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also interesting that the markets have already been adapted to expectations from F@@ ed Strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline of the inflation expectations , there are a few indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income gap has become fl@@ atter , credi@@ t@@ acks have increased and volati@@ lity and volati@@ lity of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ ten its strategy .
in the large and whole company , companies which take advantage of the greater part of its business operations in the U.S. , benefit if interest rates rise and local products will become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt become worse because an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market as well as financing their debt .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; Quality - &quot; equi@@ ties tend to react very positively , three months after an initial interests , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s in a report for the customers .
companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded the company with a strong balance sheet after each of the interests in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points .
company with high capital gains and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality at an average 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt become a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man said .
outside of pure share games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
austerity could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how quickly that is to take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , saying goodbye to Andrew B@@ ingham
the Conserv@@ ative Parliament of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter because of its &quot; con@@ v@@ ature &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly to be distinguished by commercial vals .
he took the BBC Music Awards and said that she has only im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ Collec@@ tions Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached the show The Voice and said this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leader member and will raise new pressure on the transm@@ itter , to prove that he does something which does not do the private station .
the conservative members Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal Radi@@ os@@ er &apos; troubles@@ ome &apos; and increasingly can no longer be distinguished by its commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; silly &quot; - but it seems to be Classic FM because he said .
he also took the BBC Music Awards held last December .
the BBC Music Awards held last year appear to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC @-@ Direc@@ torate pointed out the dis@@ cards and argued that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I am learning about classical music in a different way .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really is un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on order , I consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey assumed that harder to be working to engage the public than it did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music .
but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing presented in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport for this were under fire to move the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the Voice - the musical talents show at the BBC , which was purchased by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for valued costs of 22 million £ .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George in Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wishes the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hit out of our in @-@ house barn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it started the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , it refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or giving money from ag@@ it@@ ators for other maintenance formats .
internet revenue came up in August on the slower and Black Friday may be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the start of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to shop
experts believe the Black Friday in November has stopped spending
for over a decade the virtual choice has dri@@ lled , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into spirit @-@ cities .
however experts say that there are now signs that thre@@ aten the online sales , after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that line sales will stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and going back to 2000 , this has been developed over time , &quot; said Andy War@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales of the Guardian .
he stated that the online sales will increase three years ago , as a buyer to purchase with their mobile phones purchases .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now you com@@ mu@@ te it and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ished .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon that was imported in America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers will hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event , each held on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers to make their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers party websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer has cont@@ ested because of bar@@ gains , buyers may dis@@ su@@ ade buyers to do shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that 5 £ 2,000 spending a bit more than 1 £ online .
with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases has now been done via Web @-@ shops .
at the same time buy more than one quarter of the people &apos;s clothing and shoes online instead of in the cabinets .
Muslims buried in Mecca with the crane accident involving fat@@ alities - Bin Laden &apos;s family becomes sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funer@@ als in Mecca , by the streets .

among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials already stated that the p@@ add@@ ings will continue in Mecca with thousands that continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ Group would not have been able to ste@@ al the arm of the crane , when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree that was published by the state Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden @-@ Laden was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail not , but said that the leadership of the company is prohibited .
earlier this week w@@ ob@@ te Sal@@ man to disclose which caused the overthrow of the crane that rus@@ hed to a courtyard of large @-@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place in front of the p@@ addle that later takes place later this month .
the Bin @-@ Laden @-@ group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal decre@@ es also bl@@ amed the group because of not current safety measures and because they did not co@@ operates with Meteor@@ ologists .

the Bin Laden has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and involves greater construction projects .
the dec@@ eas@@ ed leader of Al Q@@ aida , Os@@ ama bin Laden was a dre@@ amy son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ 20 years .
the crash of the crane arrived in the midst of strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that at least once spent in the life of each healthy scientist .
official said that 15@@ 8 people stay in hospital .
government agencies arranged that 1 Million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to the members of the Gh@@ amm@@ ers are to be paid and the equal amount of permanent closure .

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen are above
British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased growth behind
that leads to the fact that 200 more scre@@ am shops , which are aimed at cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople , will be opened
clear , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets will close nationwide in the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that British should put its h@@ amm@@ ers and brus@@ hes in favor of the use of qualified European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you are skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush for moving from walls , you still belong to a minority today .
because British increasingly employ arti@@ sans in order to perform home@@ work jobs in their homes , so the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Véronique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her who owns the Bau@@ markets chain , said that a big increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , providing services to free@@ ze prices have now been over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open some more screen@@ pre@@ fix shops , who will be directed to arti@@ sans and close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said that she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions will be made by women .
at the moment , the men ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that more female single @-@ households want to renov@@ ate more crises than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we have to shift this more into a balance .
generally speaking , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also um@@ med their top team to reflect a similar number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including management and finance minister .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her mel@@ ded a decline in the semi @-@ annual income and outlines after the group died the costs of the closing of the shops .
King@@ fis@@ her , the screw and B &amp; Q is able to open 200 new branches .
official of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball Vice President , A@@ ich / DO@@ B have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and mal@@ ware @-@ education .
the defend@@ ants have not found guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of abuse .
on this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted power@@ fully in May .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the prosec@@ utor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ al@@ liz@@ ed out in the preliminary investigation , that the defend@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of the accounts to disp@@ ose it into their capacities , for private purposes .
he damage the damage with some 400@@ ,000 Euros .
the sport functions are also charged with financial statements .
this fact divided between the Chairman of the Sch@@ open@@ en@@ sen@@ ch@@ ats , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense represents that there was no conclusion that the association was created at no time .
the sports function would have only changed on @-@ line damage and to the sports club , for which she had been involved in 1982 to 2011 and had invested a lot of time and money to get out of the debt - the pas@@ va carried out in 2001 approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( rd . 4@@ 4,000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were in front of the situation : do we carry on the club or block ourselves ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was one of the defend@@ ants , the wholesale audi@@ tor of the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have spent money to save our life insur@@ ances as safety at the bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on the removal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debt made .
Fu@@ ther@@ more - with the appropriate financial - success , the payout of the processing sheet was determined retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
thus , I have received a portion of the allowance for damage to years later , namely from 2003 when a Plus was depos@@ ited in the account .
therefore , p@@ alle@@ ts and not Detailed arrangements , explained the former Ob@@ man of the processes .
the accounts and Spar@@ text@@ books managed to manage the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant .
why the cash payments have not been detailed in detail , asked the judge .
the association was not interested in detail in the financial sector , it was important to have been the debt of debt , so the answer .
when in 2011 against the official investig@@ ators started to abuse the abuse of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account .
these were sent , as the accused .
this securities account returned to the name of the second defend@@ ants and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? &quot; I wanted to know the judge .
afterwards , the incident knew no answer for a long time .
then he said that he did believe that this was the best for the society .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have earned anything about this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ ors set them in the room .
the defend@@ ant had been informed , justi@@ fiable the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim . &quot;
why harm bar@@ gaining ? , wanted to know Ju@@ dge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant said he had not agree to this formulation , because the club had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do , if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he has never taken a cent salary , he only moved od@@ ometer money and di@@ eting .
on Di@@ cha@@ etes , he added 1,000 Euros per month in invoice , but the actual effort was much higher than he added .
precise documents for the early years did not pre@@ dict the defend@@ ants .
these are after an operation testing , in which everything had been considered correct , no longer kept , they explained .
Kilome@@ ters have also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
all the pris@@ ings are in cash , in addition he had to go from his residence in the international market to the Bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

periods of decision on interest rates for the U.S. st@@ aves
the world ob@@ serves , when the US Not@@ en@@ bank appears on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists were inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent .
it is a historic event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest placed on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a major central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good power level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and only generate a minor inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global standards .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that chances are going well against such a step .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
deaths at the Delta State University left by apologi@@ zing
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later on the day his colleague killed and killed - Sh@@ annon wrote to him , to say that he &apos;s &quot; tired &quot; with the first murder and he wanted to make it happen , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday well @-@ known .
the police of Gau@@ le , Mississippi , said that dra@@ fted , lecturer for geography and Social @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , calling the emergency number to 10 : 00 on Monday morning
and he said that he was shot on someone and someone killed .
Lamb said the emergency staff of the emergency central that polic@@ emen would have to send to his home .
he said , &quot; I f@@ lowed my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but that is not disturbing , but probably will be excited .
the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he didn &apos;t give him .
Lamb was not an explanation for his shots .
as the police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
I really loved Amy and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot;
after writing the No@@ z gave him 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday Even@@ ing , when polic@@ emen took him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; univers@@ ally President William La@@ for@@ ge said he know nothing of a clash between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there will be &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married about seven years as a &quot; good human . &quot;
the two were left fifteen years ago , but were friends .
o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss have had a daughter who is 19 and they may be &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ds were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss always worked from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day knowled@@ les , who has been identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ds who owned a dog called Light@@ ning have met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police declared that I called relatives at any given time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go into prison . &quot;
as polic@@ emen took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , in that night he drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
in the spring of 2015 the Delta State University received a PH@@ D as his lif@@ ec@@ lu@@ sion on the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa to build the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big concert scheme .
a one billion euros in the year intends to save the Lufthansa Group only with a better organisation .
150 of the world around 1000 executives will cost the workplace in the workplace .
with the pilot &apos;s union , there is also new negotiations .
the Lufthansa to build its company structure and is evaluating the endor@@ sement of the Euro@@ wings .
the aim of real@@ ignment is a contribution to a contribution of around 500 million euros a year for reimbur@@ sement and sol@@ vable , the airline shared between Wednesday .
among other things , there is no chairman in the future for the passenger business in the future .
the endor@@ sement line of Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the previous board team , Mr Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr , the future Karl Ulrich Sh@@ adt will be responsible for the Euro@@ wings .
with the real@@ ignment the Spo@@ hr pointed the importance of the Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wishes to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet at the future .
to date , the organization of 120 000 employees was complex .
the airline operated under the umbrella of the airline Air@@ line Gruppe , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .

Luke Sha@@ w by Manchester United may not play for months due to a double fra@@ gment
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven and double fra@@ ying of his right ball .
while this was brought to the left outer def@@ ender and exclu@@ des it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w will play in this season again .
the injury was caused by rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double banner and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be displaced in the morning or maybe a day later and then in Manchester surgery .
it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic plays , and then this is happening .
in the locker room he had an oxygen @-@ mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor but if you have a double question , it will last six months , and he will not play in group stage .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red map and the suspension of a mo@@ ck .
Nicola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not pen@@ alize the Mex@@ icans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mistaken .
they can be judged by yourself if I say a mo@@ z@@ meter and a red card have been due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
a t@@ we@@ et of Sha@@ ws account got : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
considering : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V
the England defen@@ ders has an additional incentive to recover up until the coming of June with the European Championship .
Phillip Co@@ cu , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad violation . &quot;
if a player with this kind of infringement the place leaves , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you then hear it &apos;s a very horrible injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ u .
it was not possible for me to see the moment .
the only thing that I could see was the ball , which was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how hard it can be .
I feel very ill there . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to hospital - according to a f@@ oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ia ruled the environmental impact of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , Cameron is in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , as there seems to be always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron told the action of the book , instead she recre@@ ates a content release of the film version of 2012 , which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ u @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see a boy named Ted , the girl of his dreams , while he read . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , the proper name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Valley , and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this were not suspic@@ iously enough : the text presented by Cameron is sometimes written like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie showing on the website of the Internet Movie Database and so starts : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic dad , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ ben@@ ding boy , as the local environment speaks by the cas@@ h@@ itting Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , car@@ ver @-@ ri@@ cious being , &quot; which will be referred to in the name of the trees , &quot; bl@@ amed .
most likely , such a relatively low PR job was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for twenty times a child in a row .
an up@@ ing @-@ street intercom was said that the text was probably not acquired by Mr Cameron &apos;s bal@@ ancing office .
Super@@ camp confirmed that the text by Mr Cameron &apos;s employees was supplied , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion of England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
if coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but if you have chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series is not on my map .
I would not exit a down@@ ward .
A@@ cum@@ a C@@ looks page is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting placement , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry out a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball develops Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size at the test level , is an option for the attack .
in this regard @-@ up message : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from the England test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is natural to me as its head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with seven tests , there were two good attacks under tough conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that critic@@ isms are aimed at results . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no question mark on Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
a long time ago , it had been extended by the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully shot more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance is coming .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ lis@@ s praised his attitude , even if he didn &apos;t give so good performances and does not surprise me ; he is primarily a team man .
the question , how much time a test man receives , to set his mark is tricky .
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was ring in nine .
only Comp@@ ton did the chance to do home@@ - and upward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can rise was that England was first suspended in the Caribbean when Ly@@ th was in the cap - but this lost chance now lies in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a head@@ man that I highly regard .
he is an X factor / cri@@ ck@@ et@@ le player found at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season , when he had ranked 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must at least receive the same chances as the ones before him , but of course this depends on the cre@@ mat@@ ing position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which will show an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks fell , converted , and I have nothing to do about it .
I do not see why a head@@ man cannot strike there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players .
maybe his job could not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her and there is no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before joining it in 2001 as a open@@ er .
he has made three hundred pictures immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited contact with him , he has impressed me as a young man very impressed .
people may view his statistics on average 31 with the bat and 35 using the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there are no large number of backup members who rise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few smart additions in the dock .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela &apos;s Jay@@ ne , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a master@@ head .
he &apos;s one of the nicest dun@@ le of the game that will bring an abundance of experiences , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball @-@ phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful bet to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if messages are in line with the previously mentioned .
Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar rest against Australia and I for my part I have no problem with it .
some will not agree , but coaches and team points do not determine the schedule .
and you must bear in mind that , as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy for heart .
the Bre@@ xit @-@ Gre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit Britain from the EU ) could be put in the face of the EU if the economy has been in a tor@@ s@@ &apos; until the year 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ shaped way to keep Britain in the EU will get into trouble with every day , even without the choice of the genial Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour and TU@@ C , which was fier@@ cely attacked because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ ats , &quot; said recently , that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in different crises , such as the EU has now and not always of their own fault , Britain itself set aside and disturbing the changes which they most often don &apos;t want .
in Brighton , the TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that they may not like the social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
prime minister and finance ministers go on summit or bilateral sessions at foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local memorial , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they will gain alliances for reforms .
it is always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wishes for an outside Britain in the interior of the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Berlin - and leaves out that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials in some capitals took place up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we will stay or leave . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office , before it looks bad for her , as it did for the exagger@@ ation endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French Fran@@ co@@ is Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ aming force .
Poland will soon have a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain has a left .
it is hard to imagine that it will be able to use one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British to prevent their energy better off Scotland - something that they shouldn &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
so , perhaps some such ministers could even deny such minor comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , during Britain &apos;s refer@@ ential s@@ amp@@ ant 2017 , in order to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , please susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation was a ple@@ ad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ ego@@ ti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory cannot be at their cost and which EU @-@ S@@ scep@@ tics is the oligar@@ chy of the press bar@@ on , but did not protect it during the Tony Ben@@ n refer@@ endu@@ ms 1975 but not , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can well remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro Opport@@ un@@ ists who made a name for itself as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU d ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his bitter@@ ness knew Ed Mili@@ band , who was his enemies .
this was the med@@ ley of the tax @-@ fe@@ aring sheep , telephone @-@ h@@ acking , and pseudo non @-@ Indians , who own most of our major newspapers .
actually , Tony Blair is similar to it , but stated that if one sits with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , mili@@ tias more Bla@@ iri@@ er than Blair itself , when he res@@ tit@@ utes the constitution by referendum , because Blair has rejected the principle concerning the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened it a back@@ door .
the press has never for@@ sake him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly cla@@ p on her back - I told him that he doesn &apos;t need any more time for me to be missed - seems to be at risk , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of the 80 @-@ he years to repeat a mistake back then and today .
it can take , but it must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but surely with Andrew Mar@@ r , the BBC Local which he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it in a friendly manner - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ ef@@ el@@ b@@ stoff trend and wil@@ der ge@@ ars of Tor@@ ies Klein @-@ Ad@@ dress can probably say yes to everyone .
this is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no ben@@ an@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the sc@@ outs batt@@ led in it , do not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow law was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he @-@ years , when his old father saw themselves on television , to be loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mates , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
but to fight , to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and parliament@@ arians in their details on the Monday evening after all reports .
what ever want to convey the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he has even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the struc@@ turing of social media , a brood @-@ place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it is right , Cameron wants to give no open card to Europe who allowed him to keep a lab@@ ours support for a natur@@ al@@ ness like Mc@@ Don@@ nell it said .
Simon Jen@@ kins thinks for sure .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ ying with basic ambig@@ u@@ ities of the EU &apos;s membership - in harmony with their free sie@@ ge economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ oter@@ ic discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ acy of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic dispute .

experts critici@@ ze the report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful as smoking came from a meeting of 12 persons , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , they said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) In The Lanc@@ et , Lanc@@ et agreed to critici@@ ze the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; key@@ note report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and directed towards links between the experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial auth@@ oring in medical journals The Lanc@@ et last month , the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which p@@ he established his most important conclusion .
two more researchers have been writing in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are &quot; built on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the effectiveness of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful as smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of the wise and modelling transformations .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi@@ disciplinary approach ( multi @-@ C@@ riter@@ ia Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to perform their opinions on the damage of various nic@@ otine product at a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director previously achieved by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants in the meeting explained to get funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturers , but not the financing that he should have received according to reports previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied but includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which include also a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting , the min@@ t was also taken part of p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence &quot; for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s claims of p@@ he said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence whatsoever that e @-@ cigarettes have been used as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J had previously been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful as smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at its addiction .
all evidence suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is eviden@@ ced and what not , especially if there are so much public confusion about relative risks compared to tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0.000 people annually die of a disease based on smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion £ per year .
due to the clear preference of actual evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but just a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says former head of Channel 4
the former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should cease to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give her right arm , &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programmes that can not be sent through other UK transm@@ itter .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they publicly publishes public legal programs which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in harsh controversial time window to place the most popular shows of its ri@@ vals and from broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he has tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success , with the BBC in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends out which are also clearly stated by not sub@@ ju@@ tion@@ ated ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communication Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least do its production at least for programs unable to do or by order .
they send the Voice in a first class window because they want to achieve as widely as possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it is of course nonsense .
Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why an expan@@ sive tax financed by the laws that could be financed without subsidies .
the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly both original production .
honestly , other channels would give its right arm to it .
I am showing to see what this is to be public @-@ true television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , who ran from Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; due to the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to guarantee long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of the BBC state that again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart meeting in Edinburgh in 2003 proposed that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t judge the audience , but they can perform pretty much if they go on their false sacred missions to the justification of 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one wanted them to see .
the round@@ table said Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that can obtain the best value here .
of course , you think all , think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for those who care for the 150 £ a lot of money , I wonder if this is true , because they consume not much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who said also before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their hy@@ th@@ ian mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to educate and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said , only little by the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take part in the public @-@ law broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada and take this example in , inform and entertain . &quot;
the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown and re@@ comp@@ ose the commercial stations to make everything available online .
&apos; Son@@ o@@ Get &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des are changing the direction at the moment in which they are animated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified organisms that can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction right now in which they are sung with sound impulses that have a high frequencies for human hearing on high frequencies in order to be heard .
the impulses are working through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels which are responding to ultras@@ ound waves .
further to this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ Get , with which ultras@@ ound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain cancer , a invasive procedure which gives electrical impulses to the brain of people treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
girls usually do not respond to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani revealed that they did it when it was surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
the bub@@ bles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms .
the reinforced @-@ waves act on structures that are called the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ ms cells .
the sha@@ fts reach the opening of these items and enable the cells to be assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their motor vehicles are TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als .
when he turns ultras@@ ound onto the altered creatures , the record waves are ampli@@ fied through the micro@@ der@@ mic and into wor@@ ms where they turn off the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ens .
the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ Get Sizegenetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn neur@@ ons with pul@@ ses of light and release .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said the S@@ Get Sizegenetics Review of this technique might have .
in contrast to light , that must be shipped at an optical fiber to the required position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ ound sensor can pass them freely and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the sk@@ ull .
&quot; we believe that involving gen@@ otherapy and therapeutic agents it is possible to make the pur@@ pose@@ ful human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

eight golden rules for the life of school residence
eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ for@@ get@@ fulness 19 @-@ year @-@ old to a student residence , still in faith on Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the tense smile of those I ph@@ ased , and to the numerous , long @-@ made complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the pull @-@ out in student residence ranges from easily nerve wr@@ acking up to absolutely start@@ ling .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to tie out : people who wh@@ ence you come , where you come in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;ve said &quot; honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in seriousness , guys , it is just a He@@ fe@@ kt Ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - create questions and show interest .
it drew the conversation and helps you to find out the people that you might not speak in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes would be on fire and if this fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and local meeting places , but they are also places where people are moving and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
considering : do not remember to start your university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a gro@@ ove treatment at the University .
your room should be a refuge for me , but many school residen@@ ces make up a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ b@@ um@@ mel culture that can lead to friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a comb@@ at@@ one is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS rather than knock .
apro@@ pos ank@@ hel@@ e : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship make through b@@ aking .
since you begin the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to present yourself with a plate of brow@@ n@@ ies , less strange as the welcome from 1950 @-@ he years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve cho@@ p you something . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
to offer homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates are committed to entertain yourself and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly missed cl@@ ots from flour , sugar and fat make people sleep asleep when you gam@@ ble .
ste@@ al food@@ stuff is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of drops for your tea too ?
please check the with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even when they cook in the inner .
if anyone missing your stuff is annoying , and you have my sympathy - but try to handle this well @-@ balanced as my room@@ mate , that her milk add a soap to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise , of people from sleep or from work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent human being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the verb to the people who are sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my corridor asked its neighbours if it makes them a bit lighter , drum &amp; bass notes something quie@@ ter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they re@@ acted to more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 am , they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they left their own music , shut their door shut and settled into their three @-@ hour examination .
would it not romantic , if your future spouse would go into the same dor@@ m ?
the other way round , it would not be ab@@ y@@ ly dist@@ res@@ sing when you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , going back to them and then you will need to see each other every day and maybe experience how to get all our common friends around ?
of course , the heart also goes its own paths - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future couple in partnership , try at least to talk a little reason to your mind .
in this thrilling moment , in which you notice that someone has his key in his non @-@ breath room , is the limit between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer , as it seems .
a good walk is funny , but it only takes moments until he is a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
grant yourself a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never swee@@ p somebody &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
shut your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ acking your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , single @-@ drawn carri@@ ages , disgu@@ sts
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds up in the middle @-@ sized capital terrac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residence , but also the mother and the weak serving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how it can still be cheap and well done today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will be pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner thinks to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project Town@@ houses for refugees .
Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will be pushed for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass @-@ du@@ ous accommodation in containers or g@@ ymnas@@ tics has no sustainability .
because people remain a great part here .
in the face of the refugee flow , we also need plenty of living space in the decades to come .
a completely mund@@ ane , three @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed terrac@@ ed house is the solution .
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration .
this is different when you take the people into the apartment blocks .
each of the six houses , which are just built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is back peace , I go back .
then the houses can be modified easily according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living per building rises to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , with no property .
this is manage@@ able .
six months did the construction lasted .
this is reasonable .
did the construction instructions make their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : under legal standpoint I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated it always makes the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert Special and the Pit@@ ches Reg@@ ulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it still remains to be done who creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three locations .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have sent me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lux@@ uries for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is definitely not correct .
but ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : true is , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but they have been built with luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , also the ordinary people need housing .
not only refugees but also the mother who are alone @-@ doing .
I show how it can still be cheap and well done today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS , when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , tap into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install install .
some are pushed to the problems after installation , since they get an error message informing the fact that the &quot; software update fail . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait till the rush or trying to update about iTunes .
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has done this through the verification of the updates un@@ probable . likewise , it will be simpler to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it once the process is complete .
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a char@@ ger , so that the battery is loaded .
if the cargo is too low , Apple does not make that the update will continue as the phone may be stra@@ ined on half way and that may lead to a demo@@ li@@ tion of updates .

Qu@@ arti@@ sti@@ ckers for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the senior Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft organized themselves under the Man@@ tel of the Social Fund and opened a new drive on the Count of the Social Fund .
besides advising you can also participate in courses .
the social foundation runs it down from the mountain to the city center .
more precisely to the count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ place .
there recently opened a new neighbourhood of Qu@@ inn &apos;s office .
here , directly next to the shopping market , you will receive the emergency and advice on questions such as care insurance or care for health insurance and nursing .
for years now , together with our out@@ patient care service , we have found that often nursing care are left alone .
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; in fact , not rarely many benefits of the K@@ assen company are not being used , &quot; explained the complexity of the insurance company , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper of J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , which is the manager of the business@@ man and the civil sector as well as for the patient @-@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot;
besides the meetings there is the new arti@@ stry @-@ office but also prevention , health care and wellness .
this was taken into the boat by Sal@@ u@@ dis .
therefore you can use additional deals such as Stur@@ dy , Rem@@ in@@ ist training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment .
the offers from the old people centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precaution and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior Centre for Support and Care , &quot; said Heike Rie@@ del , Ac@@ tor of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
the reason for the opening of the new neighbour@@ hoods in the city center can be seen in the demographic change .
because of this make a good de@@ centr@@ alised infrastructure in the different neighbour@@ hoods of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , by Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) in the initi@@ atory fes@@ tivities , the Qu@@ arti@@ sti@@ er &apos;s office also wid@@ owed to the age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and they invite to a regular soci@@ alising Be@@ is@@ am@@ men@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the social foundation supports a major contribution that the elderly can live up independently and easily in their familiar surroundings .

men tested on 17 @-@ year Afghanistan
witnesses seek the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ ent@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 , three young men were walking distance from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him to wait .
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT @-@ gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
one of these men now cried out the youths and attacked this with their own .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ t@@ ay@@ ment and ble@@ bled strongly from the nose .
when his two friends sought out and were responsible for the bat , let them first go from his sacrifice .
with his friends the injured young man was now brought home .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a truck to their flat and was there several times over there .
when you saw the vehicle no more , the injured one went ahead of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the rac@@ ket and another male person .
under the attri@@ but@@ t of a mol@@ ar , one was beaten to the face and the th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the last one had to be brought to a hospital for medical supplies .
to date there is only a very v@@ ague tat@@ too .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1,@@ 65 metres and was clo@@ th@@ ed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller took over practice in Fel@@ ste@@ er and has invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll and Frank Müller ( from left ) apply the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich und UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ er .
we are also looking forward to Sam@@ t@@ communities , Bernd Bor@@ mann , Business Administration of Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice in Fel@@ ste@@ er on 1 October .
while UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ er is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be responsible for his successor over the coming months with a half point .
after a phase of construction , Müller opened the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro in the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship has met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll who completed their professional training in the Austrian hospital and who wants to get into practice .
&quot; we always had the mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ er , and laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of operating its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 year old Müller .
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he will be sure to be his own boss .
and so one agreed , the Mü@@ llers produced the house with practice .
dwelling , they are still in breaking ceremony @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there is the second @-@ time family father Frank Müller raised in his medical studies in Hanover , as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , N@@ ien@@ burg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is active as a Ober@@ ambul@@ ance in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed head ambul@@ ance in the district of Die@@ ph@@ ol@@ z and is engaged volunteers in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness of refuge @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ er works as a pedi@@ atri@@ cian , his wife is specialized in his wife UR@@ SE@@ L ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) on the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology .
the id@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ten , want to settle on as a house@@ keeper .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll .
after the re@@ building the rooms look modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and lo@@ ad@@ ress @-@ EK@@ GS and need a speech @-@ room more .
furthermore , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 Euros at the disposal of a conveyor programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; this shows how proudly and we are happy that the practice is uph@@ eld , &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ t@@ oll@@ us@@ urer Bernd Bor@@ mann .
approximately 2000 patients according to Silvia Müller G@@ ong@@ toll every quarter come into practice in the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ er , in the Northwest German language there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is still another dental office .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice @-@ transfer by Frank Müller : the Pharm@@ acy remains loud UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ er in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone .
in the way , who visits the master@@ ing session , the way also still faces in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical professional technicians and the cleaning force from the rim .
the par@@ ting ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era after all the medicine worked for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ste@@ er turns back .
a little sad@@ ness hid them after the long time already .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will be looking for sure , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your man is comple@@ ment@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels gladly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees leave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also highly driven at our border , &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner .
controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to make asylum application has also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make it self @-@ evi@@ dently &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it would be clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less flow rates , not above the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
you need a controlled operation .
Croatia declared &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government has previously mentioned , including Slovenia &apos;s coming refugees to Austria and Germany and may also be a cor@@ ridors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite so , this was not the Interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is rather to monitor the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is already much controlled as the exterior of the Schengen area .
as the Minister said , Sloven@@ ians wishes to support its borders for refugees but not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ n@@ id@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried to go to Tuesday in the evening hours on Tuesday , in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby Ma@@ is@@ og@@ y field .
according to local media , since then , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has ever met police vessels with new refugees .
it is mainly a case of Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days I expect his country with some 4,000 refugees , &quot; said Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from the evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which had so far granted migrants to the Hungarian border , were diver@@ ted to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the government in Belgrade manifes@@ ts that it is whether people are trying to make certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reporting , in the early morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border town , S@@ id had arrived , and more buses would be expected over the course of the day .
over Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling all night from the Mal@@ ed@@ onian border with Serbia all night away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police have told us that we should go there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually happen now to a bit further west of the distance of the past two @-@ route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities to control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously highlighted the fact that his country was prepared for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees according to possible conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; details did not name it , but he pointed out that Croatia as non @-@ Schengen member states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for fron@@ tier testing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of Slovenia since 2007 , and since 2007 , the EU partners have gone through a good record , which concerns the standard of border controls .
on the side of the Hungarian border , there are about 300 refugees stuck .
according to Belgrade , they would like to report the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities the two limits of Hor@@ ns and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stefan@@ ovic attempted to calm on Wednesday at a local char@@ ist in Hor@@ go : he kept the debates about alternative agents of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for past .
it would not currently be a big refugee area .
one cannot say if they would continue their journey on Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to alcohol - dangerous - alternative agents
however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already started to distribute the refugees in order to distribute the alternative routes through Croatia where alternative routes are provided by Croatia .
the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in some parts of the border area , there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not more spacious mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police demanded that a team of de@@ mining in the border region was being sent .
Bör@@ sen @-@ h@@ ackers : Ukrainian people pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber @-@ criminal , which is pre @-@ thrown , since 2010 again and again insight into still un@@ released financial statements and press releases on websites such as business Wire , marketing and PR News@@ wire provides .
in the information supplied , In@@ sider &apos;s business should be made in the financial markets .
in this way , investig@@ ators were raised in a total of more than 100 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will finally be captured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the S@@ EC communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 additional prot@@ esters were killed in the case .
most of the defend@@ ants have come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators are expected to have been operating in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice @-@ help Mannheim has existed for 20 years
around the Mann@@ heimer Par@@ ade@@ platz is absolutely functioning .
the people deal with their concerns , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly lo@@ me@@ able .
you control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
city @-@ cars keep .
l@@ apping , pr@@ un@@ ky life at gorgeous autumn sun shine and middle of four big tables , each with the heading &quot; Be@@ fore I die I want to .... &quot;
the hosp@@ ice hosp@@ ice care made aware of this action on its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is certainly confronted with mixed reactions .
&quot; it &apos;s about life , therefore we have gone through the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer .
the leader of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic hosp@@ ice @-@ aid is at your disposal as well for questions and discussions as a volunteer .
while some Pass@@ ant attacks spontane@@ ously for chal@@ k , and set the phrase around &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read the War &quot; or &quot; not suffer too long , &quot; others may be short , read , say phrases as &quot; so far I am not &quot; and then continue .
again and again on the ver@@ ge of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with death .
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I make clear that for me the end will come to this world I can responsi@@ bly live , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is co @-@ aid combined with the Car@@ it@@ alian activ@@ ist for the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
however , that not everyone would like to communicate on the tablets , however it is comprehensible , at the end , it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and dying was aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years contributed much to that people open .
an assessment that addresses Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ ective .
the ster@@ be@@ - and funer@@ ary companion is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
by personal experiences handling the subject , read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia .
as the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice @-@ care sought by calling honor@@ ary her@@ ical , it was immediately reported and was there at the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ ective is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - accompanied and associated with relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in the hosp@@ ice Saint Vincent .
all are them carefully trained .
Angel@@ ica Go@@ def@@ ective can handle well with her job and experience and experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another point , consider it valuable and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic Hosp@@ ice Services is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the nur@@ turing and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as further training and super@@ divisions of the Ster@@ be@@ - and O@@ bit@@ u@@ tees .
every two years training is provided for new employees .
the panels described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
even there other personal desires can be noted on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ results mixed , financial outlook for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports betrayed results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ fer @-@ Gig@@ ant lo@@ wered his winn@@ ings to a whole year because of its weak@@ est demand for cargo services and higher costs in its bo@@ d@@ bo@@ sport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holidays .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex is announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the stock fell over 2.5 percent at the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 USD in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cents lower than in former pre@@ diction .
analytical anticipated according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
the lower view comes in spite of the increased level of increases , which are average of 4.@@ 9 percent and are effective on 4 January , despite higher rainf@@ all for bo@@ ilers of heavy and large packages that will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result ahead of the previous year , due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online retail is going to increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build solid yields , if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in production and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vacation work were announced one day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , which plans to adjust 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , about the same number as last year .
during the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 9@@ 92 million served , 6 percent more than last year .
the earnings per share amoun@@ ted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , representing the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research analy@@ st .
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six out of packs asked for 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has experienced a decline in international pri@@ or@@ ance shipping during the last few years , which resulted in sales in its unit of express delivery to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has boo@@ sted the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express @-@ Unit recorded higher earnings due to higher rates , while the result declined because of higher work levels in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 per cent , will be $ 0.@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they concluded with 11 percent of loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June .
on their most anticipated meeting in the year Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists spent two days this week on a 27 @-@ foot Honduras @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table , to decide if it is time , for the first time since almost a decade to lift the lad@@ in .
dr@@ um@@ bed about them on one end of the blu@@ ff@@ ered , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat faces is a wall @-@ screen of the United States .
the card is a reminder of the fact that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and their colleagues shall put forward the economic interests of the nation over all other things .
the central bank has a double order of Congress : maximum US employment and prices remain stable here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the huge recession the F@@ ed leader have acknowledged it a third - third party &apos;s mandate - financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday if US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from the unprecedented , short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the latest turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets would be anxious to strengthen these volati@@ lity by raising the interest of interest to federal government - and be it just around one quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the job market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to be observed , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Chief Planning at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ ll Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext to not increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity in the global market is enough justification , continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which secur@@ es itself to the financial market itself .
approximately half of the econom@@ ists were asked recently by Bloomberg , have predicted a interests this week .
but the financial markets expect a wait of the F@@ ed , with a key indi@@ k@@ ator , which indicates only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decrease in the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists pay the impact , by promising that further increases are far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or about 1.4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action has been triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed @-@ policy sustain@@ ing the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chef@@ ö@@ kon@@ oma at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at this time , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if they do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a interests of financial markets would calm down , because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer , that this year , despite the complaints of the liber@@ als , more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the proposition .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , improving the job market this year was solid .
unemployment rate declined to 5.@@ 1 % in the last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels , which sees the F@@ ed as full employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although inflation continued under the annual goal of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of much lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them due to tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ theon Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world were ch@@ oked at the end of the last month after China had heard its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average worth was worth more than 16 % , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would ign@@ ite global growth in May .
the market recovered slightly in this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the pole of May .
for the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives influence the market upheav@@ al the complex calculation , when you should increase interest rates .
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would note the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the U.S. Department of Emer@@ gency .
now he pre@@ dict that they will wait at least a month to get the impact better on the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data , which describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy of the global economy is therefore one of the main factors of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in their decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary authority of the world has become .
the central bank &apos;s influence was enormous in recent years .
the mere indication of the then head of Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could see its mon@@ e@@ ter@@ ious expansion &quot; con@@ stri@@ cted , &quot; pun@@ ched con@@ fu@@ sions around the world .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , from the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , they can not only monitor the developments in another place but also discuss with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transi@@ tions on financial market movements , which appear to appear not associated with the economic fundament@@ als data . &quot;
L@@ acker , responsible member of the Federal Open Market Committee , stands for a interests of interests , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to cut its leadership to 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited impact effects on growth in the USA , &quot; L@@ acker said .
one year later , the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives re@@ vert these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe economic crisis like the Mark@@ ol@@ ith 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings Bank of England .
the recent turmoil will not come close to this layer , he said .
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which they fear of a interests , because markets are moving , &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is amended , I don &apos;t think it should be out of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to offer you a warm welcome , does not go without engagement with other volunteer involved .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is the body and soul teacher .
she is still happy with her 74 L@@ amps .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger street .
there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , the very different teaching is of course at a right school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society Rio Grande encourages food for healthy fats
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to explain in sho@@ cking way women about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted with representations of unhealthy foods .
mother &apos;s milk is made up of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins , and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by approximately 500 calories per day .
however , new research concentr@@ ates on that a higher percentage of calories did not use the only dietary adaptation that mothers should be implemented .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet fluctu@@ ate women actually protects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ders of the sports hall
the Municipal Gover@@ nor approved the building application for the 2.3 million Euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be run for solar power .
the plans for the long @-@ year@@ long turn @-@ trap on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Department come step forward step by step : in the recent com@@ mon@@ astic work the building has un@@ ra@@ ined without large discussions .
previously , the committee had decided amongst others a request to a further legal &quot; exception &quot; of the applicable cultivation plan .
with the exception , it was the permission for a special design on the roof construction .
therefore , a &quot; semi @-@ roof@@ ed roof with non @-@ wheel@@ base first and pen@@ thouse can be built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the background of the planning is the intended use of the roof for solar power : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , we get together a wonderfully large sweet@@ shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it went on the roof @-@ wall , which is destined for energy reasons - unlike the development plan - should be under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore needed because of the development plan for the wage cause no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ders of the community at the rule are more restri@@ ctive in terms of liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however at the standard trap it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports law at the sports centre is a Community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs around 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected by the school@@ - and grass@@ roots promotion .
as the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres wide hall will now be submitted to the Chamber of Land@@ hood .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed sooner than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district of Land@@ scape , who confirmed the Land@@ au@@ tor Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
however , a decision on these are the Supervisory Board , and the Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital will continue to work in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority of solar with fishermen and the further existing inner station can be reloc@@ ated to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
the staff that cannot be offered with P@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a workplace in We@@ il@@ heim , so Jo@@ chner @-@ white .
the employees are informed of the plans .
triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only the official Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private office in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the question of who is to compete , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; came into play according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; who volunte@@ ered to take over the direction from October 1st and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means in any case a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a mur@@ ing of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist of cent@@ esis and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic illnesses .
surprisingly for the next two years , fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board agree to meet both houses , until next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ y , which has over 35 beds , will finally be closed down into P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far , the land@@ im had planned this for 2018 , when the current renov@@ ations has been completed in the hospital in We@@ il@@ heim .
Land@@ au@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ white , who is also chairman of the super@@ visory board , stands out to meet that the house , which is owned by the Bundes@@ shortage , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; the close me off . &quot; as it continues with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ white didn &apos;t say , there are several reflections .
at present there are a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sych@@ ologie .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; Fischer talks about the Qu@@ asi Moving on the Le@@ ch , who had been received by employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a che@@ er for over 30 years , have not existed .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of physician director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been again under threat in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the obst@@ etri@@ cs .
the manus@@ cripts of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are demanded today in the evening ( 20.@@ 3.@@ 00 ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .

Jag@@ ni@@ aks with two injured on Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tor@@ ists have been badly injured during their Shel@@ es@@ try on the afternoon .
during the super@@ occurrence at a ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( District of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , like the police .
after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought in hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear .
the dete@@ ctive police find .

a Tat@@ suspic@@ ious has the police for the ly@@ che who have been mis@@ led for many 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse was thrown into a channel in rock @-@ breaks .
one since Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate , a non@@ violent struggle has fallen victim to a victim .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , such as Pro@@ secution and the police on Wednesday .
as a tat@@ ting suspic@@ iously , another was also held on Tuesday evening of the 20 @-@ year olds , who in fact led the indication of and the investig@@ ators to the locality of the bodies .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after they had not arrived at the eve of a visit to a autumn in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , just as agreed upon it .
in his search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators fell on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
finally , in the tan@@ gle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the wounded , a Tat@@ ar was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the suspect att@@ ach@@ ers then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .

refugees need accommodation : study warns in front of housing .
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
also more refugees seek a paid be@@ ad .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
the Social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long been started .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU more and more people push for a market that is now har@@ dened in many big cities .
they compete with a consistent citizens all over the last paid dwell@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to build 400@@ ,000 new units every year by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the result of a study on the mandate of the &quot; Social housing &quot; construction . &quot;
to compare , this year , the total of 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany .
that will take up 14@@ 0,000 homes .
refugees are no longer obliged during the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers in a first @-@ period accommodation .
many come across the flat market and put them into the long sn@@ akes before the flats .
according to statistics princip@@ alities in last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were present for rent .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to rising refugees .
the study also brings considerable failures in the H@@ ousing policy of recent years .
Germany is a housing deficit stood before , which is bigger from year to year .
nicht löschen ! ! currently , in the metropolitan areas have already been around 7@@ 7@@ 0.000 dwell@@ ings , laments O@@ Günther , author of the study .
so many Appe@@ als therefore lived in big cities of not@@ aries in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ inten@@ tionally further in the &quot; Hotel Mama because of the lif@@ ter on the housing market . &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per head would last for the first time in the last few years .
to solve the problem , the Alliance of &quot; Social housing &quot; proposes a restart .
thereby new incentives are to restart the social housing construction .
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the under@@ world tax and the basis tax for sponsored apartments can be exposed .
furthermore , an attractive tax @-@ free switch @-@ operation is needed .
the Förder@@ programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the Staats@@ bank Kf@@ W is now well attended by both towns and villages .
a good week after the start was the Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros already more than half of the available around 300 million euros .
now the project is even opened .
refugees have free trade : Croatia and Slovenia are going to establish a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no transit coming more , as more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces that transit through Slovenia leads to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to engage with neighbouring Slovenia for the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian indoor Minister , and when it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees stuck to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had paved its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws that occurred the same day might be su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous on the same day .
Croatia wants to let refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police picked up the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU @-@ neighbouring Croatia in the morning .
the majority of them were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came to the bus as well as with Ta@@ xes in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after her arrival she would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not come to the border @-@ fence .
for this , the fron@@ tier consists of other dangers . there are still sharp mines of the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining is now due to quickly make a secure passage .
Hungary will hardly come to Hungary after closing the border to refugees .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 of those people .
just before the end of the Monday the Monday was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the overcoming and damaging of the border count as a crime .
in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore 35 pen@@ alties were introduced .
sentenced to five years and deportation from the country to the prison quarters .
according to the immigration office , one took the Tuesday to the newly at the border with &quot; Tran@@ sitz@@ onen &quot; in total &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sitz@@ onen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , of which nearly all - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped there .
but virtually no one has a view , granted asylum in Hungary .
in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot;
the distr@@ acted asylum seekers should be brought up there .
in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ s@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees .
and in R@@ ös@@ s@@ ke the workers began to regulate .
they gathered the trash , which left tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
the bor@@ der@@ ies were built and one of the recording studios in the border zone has been modified .
but no one wanted to express itself at the goal of this transformation .
Austria has only a few refugees following the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
around 20,000 displaced people stopped to government but still in the country .
around 1400 people are waiting for Germany &apos;s drive to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning to the German authorities .
in free@@ wheel , there are regularly smaller groups of refugees trying to walk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mayor took &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ges@@ ic@@ ested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the establishment , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wer@@ n@@ stein Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
because Germany on Sunday failed to set up the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was the conclusion that she was immediately offered his help and spe@@ ech@@ less , together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Pass@@ au .
before we used the un@@ hoped guests just to get married , with J@@ ause and drinks .
we said immediately , we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ O@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man wouldn &apos;t take it to hand a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ brig@@ ade .
&quot; we really enjoyed &quot; this town .
in the Sunday evening in Wels the Sunday evening cat@@ ers headed by a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , to advance it after the notice , that the train traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was placed before the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein am Inn .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein the cross border border is generally highly regarded in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably and , on the day a two @-@ di@@ er@@ ves@@ cent athle@@ tic - organized by the Union Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further thousands of us to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ c@@ ical policy :
instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help construction of structures that human@@ eness , our German Chancellor also officially lifted up the position adopted by the Hungarian Government within the National Socialists .
sur@@ rendering of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states now in the fron@@ tier areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the p@@ oul@@ try will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gel@@ ob@@ te land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a major challenge will become , given the continuing refugee flow and the nearby winter , to make Dec@@ ent conditions for protective people .
and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 - har@@ dy quart@@ z
Conrad has filled all hands with the flood .
Christian Konrad is accustomed to having his word weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen bank , to turn off the neighbourhood of thousands of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first emergency centre &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has finally been able to get a grip on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; crisis situation . &quot;
overall , Konrad Adenauer expects a need of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the previous year .
in order to fulfill the number , in the next few weeks , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found - 20,000 make the countries available , 15@@ ,000 by the Bund .
should there be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the regional population .
these could have been granted for it , nor for the coming refugees to create a population .
&quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
morning there will be a meeting with Car@@ dinal Christoph Schön@@ born , who shall be trans@@ figured as the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; great expectations the asylum @-@ ordinator is also involved in the OR@@ F &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the platform allows private individuals to offer uncomplicated accommodation .
besides , one hopes on hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for the accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in emergen@@ cies , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ers must respect a certain height of the towels or size of the so@@ viet .
for a refreshing time would have to apply &quot; new standards . &quot;
however , in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is successful in keeping a successful company , he explains Konrad with his experience .
I am an older gent@@ leman , that one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness would be his main weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er did not cause the Republic as they were asser@@ ted .
their number of employees want to increase it on three to four .
my own accommodation search has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to put a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but there are apparently problems with the permit .
Linz calls for a better distribution

this is not so necessary , as one can only lo@@ dged the persons affected without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergen@@ cies , other locations are to be checked for their fitness .

Past@@ hofer : &quot; boundaries are not dis@@ car@@ ded &quot;
in a longer call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) acts on Monday following further action in the refugee question .
See@@ hofer has given me assur@@ ances that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuing journey of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , it contains now the corresponding border controls .
special moves with refugees to Germany will not be giving there any more .
however , the protective functions would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that now Austria once again enters its borders with controls , is a logical consequence of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the course of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a matter of time
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neues Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T has moved , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he can imagine to invest in start @-@ up companies of the Neue Wer@@ ft making , and later to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the start , S &amp; T intends to cooperate with the new neighbours - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.9 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location of S &amp; T in the Tech@@ Center , which is a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is respected by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meter area in the building are rented , for another 40 percent give it to requests .

in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which it sells , among others bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers are now all about hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously , several weeks been converted .
&quot; but I have long over@@ written whether I should open a store for a long time , &quot; said wide .
decisive for the decision was among other things that also the fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of a dedicated site where only their hand@@ bags are sold .
&quot; we are the spicy in the Greater Region of Linz , which sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , which has its own Italian roots .
her fashion interest has got wide from her mother to the cradle .
I dive at most when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women have to answer a nice hand@@ bag in decoration , the specialist will not answer last security too .
maybe it is because a beautiful bag value each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this feature also connects to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
whether he is referring to xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists or knowledge sl@@ ums in the international crisis policy - the applicant &apos;s candidate for the U.S. presidential office will be power@@ fully tri@@ cked to the presidential campaign .
and cuts well off .
it is also registered in the Pf@@ al@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the property with milli@@ meter mark deri@@ ves .
the New Yorker , with its com@@ promis@@ ers , takes a term in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
man@@ cher in the 1200 inhabitants village is over -@@ zig corners with it is related .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt at the Pf@@ alz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ all@@ aus Simone Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers make to be the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that very exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their everyday ten@@ stad@@ ters , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del .
a native K@@ all@@ ot@@ ter has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spr@@ ut@@ ors , to which besides Tr@@ ump , also the Ket@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , too , so with the asser@@ tion that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
on the King of the heart , he has not brought it there .
admittedly , there may be respect for the performance of the family , but also tended that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a p@@ inning , &quot; Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the gi@@ ver , says it .
this is the dump from the village of the gi@@ ver .
the p@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA a pub for gold @-@ mines opened .
corner of the property company was first property purchases in New York .
but the life of the grandparents was not free from tradition : their desire to go back to homeland , was the bay@@ er@@ ian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time part of that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once distr@@ acted without permission was the director of the Institute for Bre@@ ath@@ ic History and Folklore , Roland Paul , to film start explained .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
and that is contrast to the included statements of the night .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall called to sc@@ are illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the polar , it is not so person@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a Vis@@ itor &apos;s Rel@@ umps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born of Heinz &quot; ) .
the winem@@ akers in the retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing itself , &quot; he is always so sti@@ cking . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming from ?
&quot; I cannot imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pen@@ inn@@ keeper Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ ner@@ e K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter , that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz near a visit did something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; I cannot imagine the Donald ? &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are better , if he did not dar@@ ing the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the US had been as if he had , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never had arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; grapes are ripe again without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefan@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son e@@ aves to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there has been no major shifts in the assessments for today .
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the Federal Republic , when Mal@@ col@@ m g@@ do@@ ck@@ led the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , tu@@ cked in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs , of which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun included .
this downside of the resistance seemed to play an important role for Australian TV people , as Sun@@ rise has posted an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , compared to them Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today a slight increase on the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) .
today in the last few months Today has concluded the gap to Sun@@ rise .
in August we reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise .
at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 occurred .
hitherto in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today .
this is the most interesting thing that happ@@ end every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Metal to the giant Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama of a recent we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to join the New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could take a hit show solo without the giant Star Rebecca Gib@@ son .
the outcome of yesterday evening rep@@ lied with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 millions spectators and hit the Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) of the new tri@@ via show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe concluded in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
half an hour ( 17 : 30 p.m. to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on the Friday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia 5@@ 20,000 audience received audience and in the second half an hour of 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ sea at an average of 6@@ 20,000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will also be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will prevail on 17 : 30 as well .

the last three voices are : Bachelor &apos;s Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
to be secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have un@@ know@@ ingly to who The Bachelor wins .
the woman , who eventually ended with Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was wrapped in the greatest secret language .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one that has received the last rose .
but when we come with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three , you might have acci@@ dentally deleted a hint about who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed up to the final on Thursday sealed
all three women have left out in a visual way about why wood is the perfect man and called it his sense of humour , ambition , family values , and positive outlook as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who was supposed to receive the last rose ? &quot; they could become their answers to the game , who won the heart of the torrent .
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki ex@@ tras you both quickly - except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood came together with one single relationship from the first day on .
&quot; from the moment when I went into the house and ( Sar@@ re ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , that I felt quite compatible and I did not expect it throughout the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on &apos;s Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands at both feet on Earth , making it so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam is fit as a pair of Sam
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay was that the home @-@ visit last week made her clear that wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now going to see him now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked to choose to wood , if not her , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 hrs . , on tennis .

Jar@@ ry@@ k Hay@@ ne had several options to start his NF@@ L career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the US - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive performance day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
some coach would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank , when he lost a jo@@ ck@@ e@@ angel as it was the Aussie @-@ Rug@@ by league during his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday with 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return a Pun@@ t return and even to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to prove his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of its ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill , encouraged them .
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also public in his press conference in accordance with the title .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Special Education , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ g@@ hey , who told him to do his hidden foref@@ a@@ thing and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ k Hay@@ ne patented in a Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first toy area of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start to gain Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian geography for his NF@@ L revenue .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and told later the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that it could not imagine a bad start to his NF@@ L career .
&quot; that was a thing that now happens , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne .
Hay@@ ne inter@@ connected the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut at that time in 2007 , when a pass was found at a T@@ ry for Queensland in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters are calling for the high refugee figures the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn course in big flas@@ hes at the start of a heavy crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , where there is no need for the many new pupils in accordance with new teachers : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; Ai@@ re@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; otherwise we will get ven@@ ding in the Bavarian Education System . &quot;
the Min@@ ority faction of the Free voters will be conven@@ ed until Friday in the Frank@@ ian commune .
actually different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees also dominates the free voters meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will be transferred to a religious ship , &quot; said Ai@@ fal@@ ger .
Ai@@ bon@@ ger demanded the establishment of UNO @-@ protected zones for refugees in Syria , such as it existed in the former Yugoslavia in the nine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is not further , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers do not want to expulsion the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is why Ai@@ wan@@ gers also demanded more staff for the administrative approaches , which are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ verter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ fal@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we br@@ aces globally uniform standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sho@@ ves , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there we have to be able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the national politics in big flas@@ hes does not fall under the table .
a years of durability remains on the agenda : education policy .
the new school year , K@@ ult@@ us@@ Minister Ludwig aqu@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) has launched the pilot @-@ test &quot; central stage plus &quot; with an extension of the g@@ ymnasi@@ al centre of three to four years - in the result it will last nine years up to the finish .
but that is not far enough today .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss .
we demand freedom of choice for all g@@ ymnasi@@ ums that want this .

4 people killed after poli@@ cem@@ an um@@ bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal when the police res@@ hu@@ g@@ utter a crowd against the proposed new constitution , an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , approximately 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu .
Mus@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ phy , Chief Editor , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of you cast stones and fire bom@@ bers .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said , the police have used Tr@@ eng@@ eng@@ as and turned into the air before it turned on rubber bul@@ lets .
20 police and five civilians were wounded , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets from which it cannot kill , but traditionally used as less deadly alternative , obviously a high death rate produced .
the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal when members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ge@@ i say that new provinces , which would be formed in the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in the western Nepal from the ethnic group of the E@@ AS , who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10 .
in August , when the four major political parties under@@ signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very much @-@ deb@@ ated theme in Nepal , which has been governed centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on its way , but the legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lature had voted this week over certain cl@@ auses in the draft law in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .

for months I was negotiated behind closed doors , che@@ ered , deb@@ ated and drawn .
these are the plans for a new cottage settlement in the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; presented its plans for the first time on the Monday evening in the City Development committee .
originally this point has been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project Cri@@ tic and the F@@ DP group , Ralf Lie@@ hr@@ ung von der System @-@ Bau compl@@ ained in the offensive : &quot; we do not have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
however , it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
for months , it has been in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros per project .
fierce reactions among cephal@@ op@@ land@@ owners who arrived into the meeting were the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , see@@ ker owners and board member at the Inter@@ lie@@ ger of the An@@ lie@@ ger , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , laments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a Ferr@@ kl@@ ot@@ z that prot@@ ru@@ des all other customs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , he fears like several other project critic , that the traffic would be strong on the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the entire bus stops are coming , so that that pays &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the good one hect@@ are area of the former Gast@@ stätte , is still open .
there is no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a conclu@@ sive idea , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling donations to raise 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL .

Google has an unusually personal approach to announcement of donations to his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , has served with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to our journey there were many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants are grown in Europe , many people are looking for help and my family are desper@@ ate for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations offering assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global funds raised from donations to a value of 5.5 million in size , with € 11 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europe has been faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

over the years obesity is proven to be efficient for treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by men who are disease @-@ fat with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , some degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I from 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General hospital data that have gathered them in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity , stomach ul@@ ting and stomach tu@@ b@@ ying , to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly obes@@ e .
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo from this operation sank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the 5th year in this study .
meanwhile the BM@@ I was with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes were about equal to 29 .
under those who undergo a surgical procedure , with 36 % the diabetes condition sol@@ ves completely and at 28 % in partial .
in the medic@@ ally @-@ treated group , diabetes is only recorded in one per cent and partly with only about two percent .
moreover , the results were better at the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &apos; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , they found out the authors out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels from h@@ mo@@ bi in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 per cent , write the researcher .
after surgery , the average ha@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
however , in the medical treatment group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ mo@@ genic world A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng h@@ su and its colleagues .
the research team also negoti@@ ates average results for the two kinds of surgery .
in the fifth year , the byp@@ ass @-@ surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) in comparison to the Gast@@ rec@@ tom@@ y ( 7.@@ 4 % vs. 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ global in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.0 % ) and reported more a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavy people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was subjected to obes@@ e individuals who undergo a obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that attempted conventional methods .
although the new study has no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing to people with a BM@@ I under 35 , who are interested in the process .
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said .
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously once the patient lies with its BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting too long before we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said .
I guess that once they accum@@ ulate these genetic changes that have joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , this revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is currently acknowledged in fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ sigh@@ tly , comes back to the sho@@ al of her youth after years , and this is fallen in love with her .
so also in the recent novel Roman &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; powered by Luisa Bin@@ der .
above the love story the novel might be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück reader because it takes place in the Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the German professional writer is grown in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to place her home village a literary monument .
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe could not take on all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East started . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of Refu@@ ge@@ es .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuous refugee crisis in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he urged that under the present circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admir@@ able by refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts at addressing the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that there is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , primarily by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries .
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction from the US attracted a chain of irre@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
after September 11 I express my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and this has been creating unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the intake of hand san@@ iti@@ zer through children in the last 4 years
po@@ isons control centres in the US report about an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under 12 years - the marke@@ th@@ dis@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants so as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , climbed the cases of revenues from hand infections in children under 12 years , the tox@@ ins control centres report , from 3.@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; children are getting more and more frequent at these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them go through in the ER , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N .
he said that some children dis@@ inf@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , while some will do it to impress their friends , or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
video on YouTube show how young people dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants could only drink for a cheap experience .
young people have supposedly mixed a dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcohol mou@@ th@@ wash to maintain a tougher drink .
younger children can be taught by attractive ar@@ omas of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez .
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are mar@@ ized .
there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice , which are very appealing for children .
hanging dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants included somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few dri@@ ps can lead to alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is most concentrated of alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ king , hospital in the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a sip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume much alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ ans from straw@@ berry sub@@ san@@ iti@@ zer in school was brought into an emergency treatment .
her blood non @-@ alcoholic was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which at an adult is legally drunk as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor that treated them in G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah imper@@ ed her words and was unable to walk when she came up in the ER .
doctors watched them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of mil@@ n trau@@ ma , since the girl fell by the alcohol and had joined the head , R@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ x@@ ahs &apos; mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez gave parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ is@@ ers , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women were killed in Ontario , after the swal@@ lowing of the wall dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , not declared ingredient .
staff of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl@@ al@@ co@@ hol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January he was three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , to po@@ isons their &quot; reported &quot; teacher &quot; by anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; so it announces a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand san@@ iti@@ zer and ex@@ iles them from their room .
the police considered the failed plan as &quot; stor@@ yt@@ tz , &quot; and pointed disciplinary measures to the school@@ authorities .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
with a refres@@ her accident on the cross @-@ line between Nord@@ ring and On Her@@ ding , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old motor@@ ist has been easily injured during a refres@@ hment stand .

in the episode , he triumph@@ ed with his trucks in the h@@ eck of an audit and check the Ford Fi@@ esta in previously .
in the vehicles involved , in the case of approximately 10 000 Euro , the police were sharing .

D@@ ons increase guidance via Celtic on five points
Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s el@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a terri@@ er victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so the D@@ ons will create a five @-@ point gap between itself and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors about shar@@ mon@@ y from Celtic Glasgow , which was spontane@@ ously released by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates don &apos;t stand under increased control since they are preparing for the confrontation with the Dutch tab@@ ular guide .
I don &apos;t think we feel deep under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of introduction competition in the Scottish football bored football - de Bo@@ er
the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch @-@ fans have lost interest in Celtic , since there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers .
de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they do not show highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not talk just about the return of the authority .
they are talking about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
there is a lot of tension at the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it is not just the people of Scotland , who want to see these games .
I will ro@@ aming the things , s@@ ör@@ te de v@@ ila .
Ron@@ ny De@@ ila has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wor@@ e to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malmö and subsequent retirement from the Champions League followed the defeat of 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now positioned with five points lead to the top of the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it is very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad@@ dened by what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we must go on .
we really need to really get the assistance from Celtic because that makes the players better .
now it is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton carefully with January @-@ transfers
despite his comments only a few weeks ago that he indicated some January transfers , Rang@@ ers boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful in the signing of new arrivals and ins@@ ists that he does not want to bother the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ ders .
the ex @-@ Chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer Window is very different from the summer @-@ window . &quot;
the players who come in summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate everything you &apos;ve seen with our own group of this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more harm is directed , by going un@@ necessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it goes up altogether .
in the period of May to July , unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate is 5.@@ 9 percent exceeded that of the UK@@ Y by 5.5 per cent , as the figures of the Office for National Statistics ( ons ) showed .
meanwhile , the employment was in Scotland by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland was in the course of the quarter amoun@@ ted to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland made a historic decision to remain part of the UK .
in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with increasing employment and a drop in unemployment .

why I will be a witness of an ec@@ z@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man will be put to death .
if it happens and I hope it does not happen I will sit in a viewer gallery in the death chamber in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sip will be executed by the Gi@@ ft .
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
the invitation took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day is closer that I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
and I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists will be allowed to see directions in the US , and since more applicants are available than places available , a ma@@ yp@@ s lottery will take place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen , who will be watching it emo@@ tionally .
I cannot do this .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s narro@@ wing friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a half @-@ hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh@@ ing a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma captured me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants and you &apos;ll get access .
I compl@@ aining about her .
she adm@@ its that she has been able to form@@ ulate better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do .
Richard Glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things I said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it , even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter in order to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go down here all the details here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is inno@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ esis would make him guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that a strong probability is that it is not inno@@ cent of murder .
I think that there is not enough evidence to justify a death component .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porter who you can contact for this .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man from dying an unnecessary death .

Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to pronoun@@ ce him and hit him , to end racing .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards made by Racing Victoria tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables in the past year and im@@ min@@ ent to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integration of the racing department of Victoria Victoria and claimed that she conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a racing day treatment , the last Stro@@ h@@ m on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do that which is best for racing and he found himself in difficult circumstances , when it was about the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ sets behind Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
he had kept back 18 months because of the esp@@ ionage accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; see &quot; as high @-@ suspended grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about this and I have long been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything is coming out once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy .
you know that it is widespread .
sometimes one respon@@ ds and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to be walking around and I want my owners to think I &apos;m trying my best for them .
when they start thinking , I do not do this , then I should not be any more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously Moo@@ dy had told the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the full division had tried to sp@@ y his co@@ w@@ shed .
&quot; just eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - which I will call if I was asked - and offered him a job in my stables for information about what I do inside my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com
they clearly believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
if that is the case , they should certainly put themselves in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to put myself down .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , President of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy &apos;s President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of that time and are still today .
should I think that it &apos;s personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L celebrate it and makes people responsible outside trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my licence and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think about it now .
but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter and that makes me sad .
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the fruit levels of athletes have built up with the long @-@ lasting Kob@@ alt investigation into Li@@ dar@@ i and that L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to he that he could throw out his license across the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ har@@ ass@@ ed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the four @-@ day treatment rule was &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse @-@ deb@@ ating side , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said .
&quot; one of my employees has caught wrong mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , so what was like that .
and it also worked so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes against ri@@ vals for claims to Ring@@ ing
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised criticism of the Tac@@ tics set as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ er of the &quot; E@@ Q@@ AS &quot; ring will be allowed to go Friday night with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett really made a scar@@ ed note on the Storm Team , after its crew tac@@ kled the Final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model of Rug@@ by League and said that the two out of Queensland was not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy def@@ aul@@ ted the s@@ ack@@ bu@@ g of his team and said that it should only be concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy sur@@ added that the criticism of two leading coach at his team confi@@ dently agree on that they were worried that they were worried , being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens over and over again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about E@@ vil , when they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tically for a real focus and that has produced the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , it is likely not to be used to lose so it was a bit of shock for him .
it is strange , as this time again stops at this season .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the net@@ ting idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons has won the Premier League in 2010 featuring &quot; boring &quot; soccer .
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
he took his play on Saturday night on Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was being critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sh@@ utter .
but now he has a team who can play and that we look exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game , which you would like to play if you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , making them play as they play .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against Cow@@ boys .
the game of Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not looked at it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are Pau@@ wel@@ s doing and do not have points a t@@ ying ?
for me it is the maps .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet in a phase still upon it .
the Storm team opted @-@ off at this weekend , since they won the right to receive the North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin starting next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bians with 200.000 $ deposit after drug application
a man , who could potentially become a life @-@ long punishment , due to its use , to come into possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine , which was mug@@ gled up to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month , after the Federal Police was 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and opened in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he did his co @-@ defend@@ ant at the marina in the afternoon and later in the café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ ogram of the drug in a Chinese response .
despite having a potentially deadly punishment for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there &apos;s no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been from an inno@@ cu@@ ous cause .
the judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Mar@@ agan , was worried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear links with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday .
in case of a criminal law he lied the police on his place to stay .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s &apos;s mother and st@@ ep@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ ving statements made by the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge flan@@ nel .
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him off , not to appear , warned him .
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions he returns to his Australian and his Serbian passport , given daily police and at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : Führ@@ er@@ haus Stop
at a refres@@ hment with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been badly injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three leading trucks were bra@@ ked before a permanent exhibition in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noted it late and tried to escal@@ ate in vain , to so@@ ak in the last moment to the left , like the police .
the leader of the accident @-@ causing lay@@ outs can be completely separate .
the driver was seriously wounded in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was locked up over six hours to 2 pm .
it caused a damage to 12@@ 2,000 euros .
ste@@ van Hog@@ g used phone from girl to l@@ ure p@@ n@@ oph@@ ile for sending pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
Ste@@ van Hog@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this was sleeping , logged in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of stun@@ ned images of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl then woke up later and discovered that the phone was absent and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hog@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; web research &apos; who used the terms for the search for un@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hog@@ l@@ prevailed against the officials that he would do it as it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a poli@@ cem@@ an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sc@@ are her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor &apos;E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction that it might be addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
he found that the Search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a poli@@ cem@@ an to frigh@@ ten a co@@ oph@@ ile .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him photos and the he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to temp@@ t them .
he said he is sick in his head , when he drank , and said , he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on tre@@ mb@@ ling , and on crying .
she then saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and made the defend@@ ants at this time .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said the defend@@ ant Computer und Play@@ station used to speak with girls who looked much younger than he did .
Hog@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded himself to be rejected in the sense of indictment un@@ authorised pictures of children on 14th June last year and did not appear before court for a hearing on March 24 of this year .
def@@ ying attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Hog@@ arth does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual perpetrators , since one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; might be found in his dun@@ geon .
Sher@@ i@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael res@@ ize the judgment of October to October in order to receive background reports on social work .
Hog@@ g was granted in this case but was held in custody due to hear@@ ings on other cases in custody .
he was still accepted before the date of the Court in the register of sexual pris@@ ons .
user @-@ user soft to small border transi@@ tions to Germany
more and more refugees will be ra@@ iled up at the German @-@ Austrian border from the major control points .
many bad users made of fear of discovery and soli@@ ds the human being multip@@ lied in smaller border @-@ operations .
at the Austrian side goes out , a spokes@@ man said by the Federal Police .
over 1000 refugees were picked up in the coun@@ ties of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
you arrived on foot over bridges and reser@@ va to the German side .
there they are taken in reception by federal government and passed on to the registration .
at the Munich railway station , the Federal Police in Munich arrived on Wednesday night much more refugees .

Stuttgart : sp@@ urs of Tro@@ pen@@ ny &quot; Henry &quot; in the South @-@ West expected
me@@ teor@@ ologists warn of stor@@ ef@@ ields in the South@@ west of Mid @-@ afternoon on .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , the current warm sea air air is currently divided into the country , shared the German weather service ( D@@ W@@ D ) in Stuttgart .
the crus@@ hing T@@ ief is the runner of the Tro@@ pen@@ ny &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic Ocean during the last days of the Bermuda Islands .
fierce storms and thunder@@ storm are expected primarily in swimming .
according to D@@ W@@ D there is still to Thursday morning at the Black Forest , at the Schwä@@ b@@ ular Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ see@@ ker with Bo@@ ys from 60 to 90 hours of hour .
and so on Friday the sun cannot be seen again .
the mass is doing it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
2015 has been noted primarily with compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals were falling out according to the Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) in August alone on this segment .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( publicly available 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concepts and new upper and luxury cars , a lot of new comp@@ act@@ models will be presented this year .
one of the biggest ser@@ m@@ ors for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which is available in the autumn by the de@@ aler@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model well sold , the new A@@ stra is not to be much more expensive .
Opel is setting out a step below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the A@@ stra has a new 1,4 @-@ l@@ iter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
there are also another diesel engine and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 HP up to 147 kW / / 200 PS to which , for the first time , three @-@ cylinder gasoline gasoline engines are also available .
unlike the most important ri@@ vals VW Golf and Ford Focus , there is the Opel A@@ stra first as a fi@@ dd@@ ler .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible on the IA@@ A .
and what will be applied to new comp@@ acts next to A@@ stra A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra Rival Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair is the Mé@@ gan@@ e exclusively as a fi@@ let in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporting GT @-@ version .
in retail , he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ Strait wants to find its position in the highly @-@ growing segment with the new model .
thereby , the compact Infin@@ iti is equipped with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will receive a pet@@ rol motor with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 HP .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno to celebrate its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.@@ 0 @-@ l@@ iter @-@ bom@@ sl@@ or and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is more than 170 new@@ ton meters ( N@@ m ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not brand new but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 which is visible on the IA@@ A .
outside were the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n derivatives in particular hand at the front parti@@ te . the Re@@ pair was newly created and the changed sha@@ fts equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was modern@@ ized , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ play .
in addition to the compact class , Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI has been added to the compact class at the IA@@ A in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres cell is un@@ inhabited
the Federal Constitutional Court issued an explosion of an explosion of an ex @-@ prisoner of the law which was stored for months in a small cell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have generally entitled to financial compensation when they are contained in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was taken by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
sufferers may even hope for judges even if they were imprisoned only a few days in the narrow rooms ( AZ . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
with that , an explosion @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaints was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell in the judicial frame Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spacious and non @-@ parti@@ tioned off .
then the man , who , according to his claims , was now again on the open foot , moved into a larger cell .
his office cl@@ usal because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the Land Berlin failed .
however the Constitutional Ju@@ dge , the judgment of the chamber Court in Berlin , and rejected the case to re @-@ examination there .
they see the human dignity of the man .
cham@@ ber@@ ne@@ al Court will decide at the amount of compensation
even if from legal reasons the time period has only made a few days of liability for the compensation , be a equ@@ alisation claim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to worry about the protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cham@@ ber@@ ation Court must now be clear the amount of investment damage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the constitutional presses have often strengthened the rights of the prisoners in the past .
thus they were first in April of a prisoner , in@@ mate , because he was naked in a cell .
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 as well as the multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet .
in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , a prisoner , who in@@ mate an in@@ ven@@ erable accommodation in November 2009 .
the then K@@ lä@@ ger was taken away from 15 to 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to head@@ lines all over the past few weeks due to lack of staff .
in this reason , prisoners are included 23 hours which aggres@@ siveness turn , even to bat , it should have already come about because of the tense situation .
under the information of the judiciary in Te@@ gel L@@ ens@@ ation , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied , 19 are to be dis@@ missed , 19 November 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
approximately 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of State in Germany this year , after statement by vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrates in view of the unusual challenge &apos;s resolve : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can create it and we create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a matter of fact , what is going on in Germany is given the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pes@@ tel @-@ Institute ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - every year for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it has previously been built ( 25@@ 0@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing , but mainly in affordable places of rent : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments are made from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly low @-@ priced apartments to refugees too .
President of the Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) therefore wants to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the perspective of the Pes@@ tel @-@ Institute : 80 000 social apartments must have to develop and this would have to invest a total of 6.@@ 4 billion per year for the federal government .
in addition , scientists and Federal Minister of Ministers agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing .
according to the institute for labour market research and vocational research , it is assumed that 55 percent of those fav@@ ors in Germany can be fle@@ dged in Germany .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann .
but for the integration of refugees it is critical whether they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for esteem in the recording , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researchers Die@@ tri@@ ch Thr@@ aci@@ hardt .
according to the throne , there has been a political turn in Germany : from labour market to refugees to recognise labour .
while earlier a work ban was offered to asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 for three months , just like the residen@@ ces of asylum , the asylum seekers have to spend a place of residence .
indeed , because of the lack of skilled labour - it has prevailed over the perspective that refugees should allow refugees more quickly towards the labour market .
a huge hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is lack of Germany .
up to now there is still no adequate offer for general and CP@@ D courses .
studies also show that jobs most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
therefore , the construction of networks is therefore viewed as a view of the throne of the Royal Road to the Department of Work .
the Berlin school administration established that only a few thousand parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the root @-@ rooted parents , it is only once very important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ dar@@ bar , speaker of his youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management of handles in various languages .
if the need for correc@@ tors rise up with the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to raise the amount of training capacity - approximately , by carrying more specialized schools .
in the countries , students will be prepared for teaching classes in welcome classes .
but they are not always instructed by fully trained teachers and teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
in them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ aps from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk Group is estimated that approximately 20 percent of refugees study in Germany want to study .
generally not any Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or reminder the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) now gave up his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studio @-@ wild refugees could be facilitated by access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a salary or a distur@@ b@@ ance receive no services after the asylum seekers of asylum when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter is basically not a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as they will not fall under the circle of the most animated people .
accepted refugees had to be lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ tens this split to 15 months .
but this under@@ scoring does not have to be closed , ask Ste@@ ffen Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lins State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
Islam will in future play a more important role as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should form@@ ulate the same rights in Islam , as they have the churches , and further develop the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches able to further develop a new state of religion .
important would also be the establishment of a Islamic welfare association , which takes care of the new com@@ ers .
the rights belong to the rights as well .
thus , the representatives of Islam must be in a clear person and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him some control possibilities .
to this end , too is the willingness to heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concerns , religious conflicts can also be entered into Germany .
those who wanted such conflicts in Germany have right away their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk .
he suggested to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in the future be much more today than the topic of society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism should be more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination site and General Gender Equality Act on the last decade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was very slow , as the NS@@ U @-@ series has shown that systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif in the police and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stak@@ eholder interests are long demanded and why international agreements are going to become reality in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and benefit its new citizens - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is capable of providing medical refugees in medic@@ ally speaking , writes French @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what affects Man@@ - Power and Cap@@ ability , we manage this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , an additional money would be necessary to flow into the system .
to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ec@@ ks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery forms to all com@@ ers like in the registration key topic .
brought services could be counted later with the Bundes@@ länder .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able , that many people with the limited performance catalogue that look forward to the asylum see@@ ker legislation .
otherwise , the doctors in mind do especially manage the language barriers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already so far the Berlin health concern The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated migrants to be poor in their disease than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only in clinics , also in medical offices , would have to be taken over for interpre@@ ting costs .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical expenses in the emergency out@@ patient .
and with a different diagnostic view .
in refugee camps , for example , there are much more un@@ assisted abilities , and in the youth it is about HIV instruction .
with the sometimes other disease models German doctors were taken from their education but clear , writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the lack of health is concerned , the refugees blur@@ ry even allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians had a highly developed educational system , some refugees even are doctors .
to practice them , however , they would have to take charge of their qualifications and disc@@ ard once again ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees trying to arrive in Germany is psych@@ ologically sick , most of them suffer from a post@@ injury @-@ treatment disorder or in depression .
particularly vulnerable are a refugee @-@ in@@ der , explains Die@@ tri@@ ch Mun@@ z , President of B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent published study by the TU Munich proves that every five Syrian refugee sk@@ irt is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
who is sick with a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , is suffering from other things in so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with respiratory problems , di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , heart ras@@ en and death .
more symptoms are sleeping - and concentr@@ ations , strong sho@@ ck@@ iness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
but until now only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically sick asylum seekers in the social offices may pose a request for a therapy , but the processing takes mostly several months .
in addition , in the social offices , most of the in @-@ workers or doctors who are not trained for the mental disorders , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often lead to failures , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ e@@ ge invites for dre@@ aming
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new staging of passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Circus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took back the traditions of Circus &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to draw every age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and its unique entertainment .
now the Circus speaks in Kam@@ illas Man@@ e@@ ge in the bars , was@@ hes for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , veterin@@ arian and junior @-@ entry .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current management stages .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst &apos;s family for over 33 years .
so the gift of delight lies the family in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; us is it important to take away people away from their everyday life and take them for two hours in a completely different world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior @-@ entry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; said Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept .
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international Circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm in her spell .
even the Castillo Brothers are well acquainted with its crafts@@ manship .
with the hero of the silent film , it wants to take the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and mo@@ tility - in these words they identify themselves .
your humor@@ ous art on the mast is the women &apos;s life out in the storm .
apart from many salmon rivers , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger@@ tips and artic@@ ular .
with the unic@@ ycle on a ball bal@@ ancing .
for He Yuan no problem .
Short ones fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ tened at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , a little different and fascinated with its ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
griev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject of various animal protection organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst takes position also : &quot; we do not go well to our animals , it does not go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy all str@@ aps .
the &quot; four @-@ legged artists &quot; as they are lovingly called after the possibility of every wish is read from the eyes .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel at ease , it doesn &apos;t want to be in the ring .
the first commandment so : good for the animals care .
specially to her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst &apos;s family is very proud .
the two animals have lived together eight years in a he@@ ap and nothing has happened .
&quot; Oh , suddenly , was our little Jum@@ bo up there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst .
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the cir@@ cus arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one is for sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites every 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20@@ h to its concep@@ tions .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 4 pm .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leaders , dropped off at the beginning of the year from a podium .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly on the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims of members of the opposition that anonymous death had gotten death and had warned them to accompany the speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ad .
last month they had hidden him and interrupted on his speech at the State of the nation in parliament - this is the talk that he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians SMS messages have received on their mobile phones they warned of bother@@ some of Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in the parliament ends , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective .
the Chief of chief , the party of Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , was &quot; worried about the dangers for the politicians .
w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will have up to 30,000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to increase 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the frame of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will be split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from a fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected footprint leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an Declaration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is becoming smaller and stronger than it is HP today and we have a broad and deepening portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as a independent company , we are better placed than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be concentrated on the provision of so far &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integrated technology solutions to companies &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such a statement from the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shares a company that was founded in the 1930@@ s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and the Palo Alto garage you have named the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley .
HP has passed a massive restructuring to address the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide better performance .
FC arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Arte@@ ta says that team @-@ mates have to stand before the game against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ derness , that it is only September , and as long as his rehabilitation after the plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas again .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss the next four games to England and , in view of its history , his participation in the next summer on the European Championship will certainly be uncertain .
the great shame in this current issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le , and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threat the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healing .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his ank@@ le or with the injuries he had previously had .
this may be true from the medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there are the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of more wounds , always when a player attempts to return to the middle of the season .
it is also developing an uncomfortable pattern .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had over 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ al as 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ette in the last five seasons .
the broader image for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six out of eight games since 2007 / 08 , one of the Premier League clubs which have noted most of the danger of injuries .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the danger rate during the last season will last .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a more time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the species he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ lane on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents himself a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ uch@@ y and Arte@@ ta are taking place .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Ak@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I &apos;m trying to keep the balance and give players who need to give a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are moving through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing places with the greatest inti@@ mid@@ ation effects in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated even after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken on the Tuesday night by an earthquake , where on the Richter scale 3 : 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation and remains of the far @-@ going hope to lead with its management the club to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsenal .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in the business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar representations in shows is evident , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now still doub@@ t@@ ful as ever has become , such as su@@ icide , pro@@ w@@ ry amongst young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important de@@ ath@@ birth of men at the age of 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ce ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 , as the year of the husband , to question the culture to question the men to seek help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms realized that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery are doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems .
of course , one only needs to have friends so that a friendship can work .
in the age of more social media expressed communications with its focus on style more than substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a significant contact .
our digital lifestyles have the need to be strong , li@@ vable and successful , even if in reality dominates the isolation .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists will name extr@@ ater@@ ical values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deep .
and how a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the beautiful thing of friends was that this focus on the head was made .
every character was defined by his work , but defined by his personality , which g@@ lowed through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments of football at football chairs , and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often stop trying to explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a member of the phone intelligence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role to people who feel depres@@ sed and com@@ promised , has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us will often not be able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes into mind when I try to offer long @-@ term working mechan@@ isation .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider on the phone wants to help people to look at the moments of despair , the long term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you are at this weekend Com@@ edy Central Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest when you visit the day of completely new designed backdrop , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better if you &apos;re sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone around , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Fri@@ end@@ s@@ Fest
di Santa meets to wre@@ cking P@@ SG , Mal@@ mo@@ e
Angel Di Maria celebrates by Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani following his match against Mal@@ mo@@ e .
di Santa met his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps P@@ SG to visit Mal@@ mo@@ e .
here are the artic@@ ulation and reaction to the game .
Angel Di Maria and Ed@@ dy Cav@@ ani held a course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain earned his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Santa met less than four minutes after starting his Champions League Deb@@ ts as P@@ SG @-@ player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally scored their prot@@ ru@@ sion as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute a head@@ office .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish Masters , since they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ - rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , there was no Kl@@ ass@@ esp@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ him@@ op@@ vic@@ s missed opportunity in front of the gate . he was later in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to gain 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things we have to perf@@ ecting during the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; this is a good sign .
we wanted to win and we won , although I do regret that we have not yet scored one or two other goals . &quot;
I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury to the Paris team that took place on the weekend a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own square against Bordeaux in the first League , but was picked up in the fourth minute by Di Mary .
the Argent@@ ine ground was described as the man , who can take the P@@ SG to the next stage in Europe , when he ran into the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why , when he ran into Marco Ver@@ m@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense , before he moved to Johan Wil@@ and past beautifully in the long corner of the network .
if someone believed that P@@ SG would achieve a major victory , which was disappointed .
Malmö , which reached by Celtic in a Play @-@ off , to reach this level , entered the field at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine National Park and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field moved up a heavy enemy .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who go far to Kevin Tr@@ ace P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little to the attack .
instead , P@@ SG itself had sometimes on , with some mis@@ carri@@ ages and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , who died at no less than five attempts in the first half of dra@@ fts and then abandoned after being appointed him after the restart .
nevertheless he pointed out a lot more skill than he did his te@@ amm@@ ates to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Mary transformed into an ar@@ mor@@ ant which was lo@@ dged from po@@ on in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole .
the second gate dropped shortly after the hour stamp , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had thus achieved his sixth stage of the season as I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
this ended all thoughts in mind that Malmö could come back to the game and only an excellent arrangement of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could keep low before spare @-@ player E@@ ze@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi was given a gate in the end .
the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ res , gave later that P@@ SG played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualifying games do not date out . &quot;
hut from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

during a series by Sunday Night of H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown broke out that she stressed the need for alternative perspectives and in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , we do it in the cast of the film and not the occupation of the show , &quot; said Dam@@ on .
brown responded shocked , with bel@@ ei@@ ved un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow ! okay , &quot; when the comments of the acting from The Mar@@ tian was fir@@ med .
Dam@@ on and Brown made herself the producer Ben @-@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown first .
the only black person , and she is a ne@@ ut@@ te that is beaten by their white audience .
the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists of Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film ; Dam@@ on decre@@ es that her government could give us something we didn &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was released , the social media explo@@ ded prior to dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s Com@@ ments .

it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strongly , &quot; he said Simon .
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ ring every game and therefore I will go into the game very concentrated .
the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hitler Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ra@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August .
it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sli@@ pped the pl@@ y@@ wood well , &quot; said utter@@ m .
he looked good at the ( impact training ) , looked clearly better in the bull@@ ring , and he put it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back @-@ meeting at the end of the seventh interior , the T@@ wins had her best chance to get back into the game .

the Tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two sessions against the right @-@ handed veteran , which had been cancelled prior to the play of the vulner@@ abilities , after he had been missing more than one month ago .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I liked it , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better than I got off and felt that I would make some pretty good pit@@ ches da in the third inning . &quot;

the head of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , offers military action with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the horri@@ fied descend@@ ents of military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the cup of a military involvement in Germany has gone by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict lands on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Germany Austria has also established border controls at its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Austrian interior of Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner explained the office on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , after Hungary there will be no one returned .
also Germany have sent back no refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated her . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding an agreement that could include Germany a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it has already given earlier discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
concrete figures calling them not and pointed out for talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria on the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary to Austria .
your aim is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed an extraordinary summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis so far .
the EU &apos;s interior ministers will plan to take a new attempt on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries with the first @-@ up and distribution of the people .
the federal government will put this in collaboration with the countries , called Merkel on late Tuesday evening after almost vi@@ erst@@ while consultations with the Prime Minister in the Office of the Federal Office of Berlin .
Merkel underlined , those people who need protection , complain that too .
but who doesn &apos;t have a be@@ ad perspective , could not stay in Germany either .
this idea was very impressive in the lap .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with an &quot; huge power of force . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of desper@@ ate refugees stuck in the Balkan route meanwhile on the Balkan route . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia in the night to Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest as well as the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g@@ boat depar@@ tures from Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government condemned the plan promptly .
there were first arres@@ ts of people who had cut the fence .
in Turkey , meanwhile , for some more migrants , thousands of migrants went on their way to the Greek border .

on Wednesday and in the night the F@@ öh@@ n was partly damaged with storm @-@ strength thanks to the tor@@ ney &apos;s side .
after the end of Thursday morning , we over@@ ride a distinctive K@@ alt@@ front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind @-@ bu@@ ts and a temperature turn .
as Me@@ te@@ o@@ News in a communication , Switzerland currently lies on the front @-@ side of an extensive deep @-@ pressure area over the British islands in a powerful south @-@ west .
on the Alpen@@ northern side , during the night the F@@ öh@@ n is breaking through the valleys .
in the episode of the F@@ öh@@ n to Thursday morning in the celebrations of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i land , partly also with over 100 km / h .
the hair dryer can point up to the adjacent center and en@@ cro@@ achment , and in the mountains are even Or@@ kan@@ ec@@ alls of over 120 km / h possible .

Rome now has a Martin Luther &apos;s Place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther &apos;s spot .
the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino in the presence of the O@@ pp@@ io San Marino @-@ site was bap@@ tised to the name of the German Reform@@ ator on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ olo@@ gian of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was filed in Rome from the work@@ group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded of this that the Protest@@ ants in the City of the Pop@@ es could only live for centuries as a minority only in secret their faith .
in a symbolic way , I will see that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to turn around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he was receiving the city back then as a cont@@ ent@@ ant sin .
his negative impressions likely sc@@ aled him to the opinion of historians in his future battle against Rome .
Luther was then initiated with his theses against the Ab@@ las@@ sh@@ an@@ del in the split of the wounded church .
hammer artist found three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces that Ot@@ mar Old has painted over his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and Bible tex@@ te updated .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the painting for Ot@@ mar Alt , who wrote his very personal interpre@@ tations on paper and canvas in 150 different interpre@@ tations .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has obtained the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is not syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , adapted to the respective subjects , it may quite seem quite ble@@ ak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt in his Bible project has worked , for which he met a subjective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerged are cycles that dedic@@ ate itself issues like cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
in this way , he immediately became fascinated as several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological outlook as well as the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on art books .
and since it is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post , which focused on the basis of painting with the scriptures .
he has interpreted the scriptures selected by Ot@@ mar Alt Bible and therefore present in the present context . &quot;
the texts are like verbal perception of al@@ ts painting .
it is embedded in the original Bible passage from Martin Luther and a sentence of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts for the particular situation .
the jewelry @-@ belt has golden letters .
so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old was nearly twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a great level of intimacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de and raised in Berlin , comes from a family who listened to the strict Protestant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter medal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then the education has been with the tubes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is made by Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to do this in order to be able to deal with the Lord as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second request is to help art in a faster and faster place : &quot; the perception of image environments is now moul@@ ded by advertising , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is there any more .
artists have a different lust and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have something mysterious and not decorative .
&quot; in that respect I am a dinosau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come into the images &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and let them face , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image seeks its opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post st@@ bases on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible &quot; in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; ever &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art , &quot; I like , how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old have not gone to grasp the Bible completely , but which is selected for him important , even mysterious themes .
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about pictures , the text explains merely &quot; which was written a Wall@@ paper .
for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images speak for a Mö@@ h@@ ler for both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen models - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction of the BM@@ X railway n@@ igh
plans made , place was place to place companies charged , earth@@ ed for a circuit . one year later almost everything was ready - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already over .
reconciliation in politics and management provided for survey , above all among the residents that the railway did not want to tolerate .
thus Hill near above , new space sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will enter in October , could inform the First community of Sab@@ ine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s room and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is even more visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was then without &quot; further commem@@ oration &quot; with the work in the former indoor swimming pool .
DF@@ B intensified efforts to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees to 2019 , in the end of the weekend , the Bundesliga is a clear indication of this weekend .
the football re@@ acts to the mounting situation in Germany and ensures that politics is able to help its help with tackling the tackling problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no one can say , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B @-@ leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or &apos;s minister to the authority of Mrs. E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; as the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; he announced .
the football could and wants to help .
but the decisive course needs to be policy .
the German Bundesliga team has thus expanded its refugee @-@ initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome to four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said renal s@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
also some Federal ists support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 entries put a clear sign when on the left tri@@ kot@@ är@@ mel , instead of the usual sponsorship logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint of &quot; We can help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everybody should help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sport@@ ler of the &quot; picture &quot; -@@ paper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama starts every one , nobody must &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer league , no , we have to use our radiation , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbelie@@ v@@ ably , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz .
H@@ open @-@ hei@@ ms CEO Peter Ret@@ tig said of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
to the European Quali@@ fications opposed to Hungary this Friday the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kid@@ s@@ bach marked the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large communal area of German soccer &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license ones had started in their places in their places , be great .
just as magnificent is that small and smallest associations are active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is living in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said .
this year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees with the DF@@ B range and the federal government .
&quot; the associations have already called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; said renal s@@ bach .
reporting : SAP @-@ St@@ ay loses in the event of accident
the report of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has repor@@ tedly lost the left eye on several reports by a fall of early July .
during the accident at the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house in the US it was after midnight on a water glass , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Economic Week &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost joined , was power@@ less , has then moved out of tow@@ ed to the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; c@@ ites the &quot; Wi@@ ley &quot; SAP @-@ founder H@@ asso Plat@@ former .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; in the beginning of October we meet in at the super@@ visory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf &quot; &quot; said Plat@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 years old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully &quot; &quot; fit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Southern German newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he will come back to Germany in October and further the software concert . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP so full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman of Thal@@ asso &quot; said Mr Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; .
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t com@@ mu@@ te between Germany and the USA since the summer time , however , he was no longer involved in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s important to tell him about the public with such personal history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to re @-@ stop when you come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except Ge@@ fe@@ cht ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen had an appropriate photo , and explained that he suffered the damage when he over@@ threw of the wheel .
he therefore comes up little as a reservation driver for the two ordinary mp@@ il@@ otes of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ enson Button related how a week later joined the Great Prize of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us took place in the first group of the European League .
the national player will also be missing to the championship leader of the Bundesliga in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we can not fall back to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ uss will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen , we left the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his master position at the Re@@ us position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place by tribal Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher to the world champion .
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the future appears in all the Europe League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el allowed it to be open .
with a high probability , he will also spr@@ ite the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real statement by fellow players Re@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the Fin@@ als must be the objective for BV@@ B in the Europe League , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for comprehensible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think we have a good chance to take the title . &quot;
robot au@@ tos : government wants to lead the pioneer for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner following the will of the federal government in the change of the cars &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technological &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett was decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the Department of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which provides an investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Autom@@ esse IA@@ A &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new palm age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automated and connected drive will increase traffic safety and ensure fewer stalls , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries who will come together with the industry representatives from the IA@@ A .
as part of the European Ministry &apos;s strategy paper , the Strategic Paper from the Ministry of Finance emphasized the importance of mobile broad@@ band construction and an excellent exchange rate on digital radio broad@@ casting .
for testing new technology a test circuit is currently being created on highway 9 of Bavaria .
in order for the driver &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the federal government wants to review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &apos;
in this way , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally for the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ moving cars of 10 to 130 chal@@ k@@ m@@ h .
the Federal Government is also willing to use a change in Vienna Convention until now only the human being can be seen as a driver .
with automated driving , the car takes over the management , the driver becomes more and more passenger &apos;s passenger .

following a study carried out by the Economic Department of Commerce , highly automated driving can be technically feasible by 2020 .
nevertheless , travelling vehicles on public roads &quot; should be expected only far back to 2020 . &quot;
added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in the Federal Republic of Germany , the authors of the study value for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD &apos;s re@@ vis@@ iti@@ zer S@@ ar Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the issue of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clear .
yet the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a review of the For@@ sa Institute &apos;s survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute &apos;s assessment is concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it , 31 per cent or so do not believe in it .
in France , 21 per cent of the surve@@ yed are reck@@ oned to 20@@ 25 with aut@@ on@@ om vehicles , in the USA 33 percent .
in any case the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey of the digital network Bit@@ kom , only 7 per cent would agree to take control during the entire trip on all roads .
on the free@@ way , that could be estimated by 15 percent in flowing traffic , at St@@ au 45 percent .
well every vis@@ h would leave the car under no circumstances .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old to become a duck @-@ man
it is a mixture of great fashion show and a wa@@ x@@ w@@ ns cabinet : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the clima@@ xes : window man@@ nequ@@ ins that make thanks to video proj@@ ections .
you bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which has been shaped among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great star of the fashion scene - and therewith he put men in sk@@ irts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was band@@ ed , by now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk ) to be seen from the 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle the H@@ Y@@ PO Cultural Foundation , it is a fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ pat@@ ters has changed his initially len@@ ght attitude to a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me a show was a bit about death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , you get into the museum .
the impressive collection had already taken place in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en .
it is a matter of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into this little even at the time @-@ looking work of the man , which has written fashion history , without ever completed an education .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not rebuilt , but it is an excellent chore@@ ographic art work done for so much effort : to fr@@ ise dolls , for example , has been engaged in a sty@@ list .
14 tons of material have pl@@ agu@@ ed the makers according to data of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October was still a special delic@@ acy to : a leather sk@@ osen out@@ fit with cor@@ set .

he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers alter Te@@ ddy is seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ak@@ han@@ ged Geh@@ versuche des Desig@@ ners .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put his Te@@ ddy Be@@ ar and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
with a pup@@ pet to play , his parents would not allowed him to play .
he later brought the dis@@ assemb@@ ling of fashion to himself later .
he st@@ ole fashion journals and saw himself the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought that naturally .
he was not able to pay for his first own fashion show .

jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® as fashion @-@ niche
sooner we went to the long nit@@ rogen machines in and around P@@ lau@@ d about to make meters .
the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ik@@ es have ar@@ isen in large quantities for customers , for example to for@@ ging blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the scr@@ ap@@ ly flas@@ hes .
instead the fashion is important .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® Fashion played a bigger role , was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt considers some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
anyway , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , that moves to past Taurus , a growing disp@@ ens@@ ity .
those who are not a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they make already half of all orders .
Mo@@ em@@ g@@ ly flas@@ hes P@@ lau@@ en is together with nine other companies as a member of the branch of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must bear the protected label .
roughly 80 percent of its sales in the last 15 years have been dis@@ car@@ ded .
private retailers and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
we hardly reach our products on this path .
the mass goods are manufactured in the Asian region much cheaper today and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
also the export of export , current to Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points on environmental awareness as Cord@@ ula Bauer is explained by nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have a quality seal , which reveals that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also relates to the used materials . &quot;
diploma thesis U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger Office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
to cope with the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , who need to think mostly economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore an existing design can often varies only slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago a textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter was re@@ designed the historic snow @-@ tip .
the machine cat@@ ches in some places small coastal areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ smith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ lt took herself away : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with the traditional wick@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ y tip for her jewellery .
in an elaborate procedure she shapes the pattern of silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter .
it also supplies in the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors had lived in the countryside and surroundings and want to memor@@ ize the memor@@ ab@@ ilia .
this way I see my jewellery as the modern amb@@ ass@@ adors of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; legends can not be moved , but Disney will still have to go to a new movie of his classic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it is not about a new filter , but a kind of continuation of 20 years after the first film playing with the magical child wheel .
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in the times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays in more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , last with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the Woods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
the economy must be open to the outside , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the reform of the reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for fiscal affairs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the centr@@ alist leadership group for deepening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new start @-@ ups to promote and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , said X@@ i .
the leadership group passed a series of policies , including a negative list for the regulation of access , relaxation of the border controls policy , support of the state companies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the inhabitants of the system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and businesses identified for investments do not come into question .
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of significance as it indicates the market a greater role in the issu@@ ance of resources , a public state environment assured and the marketplace is open , &quot; the statement said .
the government will also loos@@ ening control of powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how they conduct their business .
the statement also said that China limits will allow China to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer , public controlled sectors are open , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will safeguard the legally interests of foreign @-@ funded businesses and provide better services to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to choose a permanent residence permit , or the &quot; Green Card &quot; if the requirements are optimized and the application process is easier .
the law of lawyers to ensure their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting prime minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important guides like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as announced in a statement published after the meeting had been published .
EU wants to double mer@@ cur@@ y border in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cur@@ y in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and consumers for a much higher dose of nerve damage .
the Consumer Organisation Food@@ watch , which is an appropriate model of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full power of Schw@@ ang@@ ers and Inf@@ ant children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by Food@@ watch .
Wolf@@ sch@@ midt said , the threshold values of the nerve @-@ no@@ d for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish in &quot; economic reasons &quot; are raised by one on two milli@@ grams of mer@@ cur@@ y , per kil@@ ogram fish .
big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ fish , however , were so heavily bur@@ dened so strongly today with mer@@ cur@@ y rules , that on the basis of still valid limits , approximately 50 per cent of the car@@ p are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling of the limit values only 14.@@ 5 percent could be fr@@ o .
in return for that all@@ ure@@ ment , the EU sh@@ covers the bor@@ ehol@@ es in other fish from about 0,5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cur@@ y per kil@@ ogram .
Food@@ watch proved this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller plac@@ ental fish , such as car@@ p are mostly bur@@ dened so low that they already have the planned maximum @-@ values already today .
the abstr@@ actions in Kl@@ einf@@ o are therefore &quot; per@@ ple@@ th@@ ora of distr@@ actions , which alone helps the economy , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
Mercury is a high @-@ toxic concept for humans linked to food chain , especially in boot@@ fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government is warning that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can be caused especially for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage of the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry is explained on its website with regard to the current limits , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mer@@ cur@@ y occurs mainly through coal @-@ burning in the environment .
the German coal @-@ power plants meet according to a written informing from the Federal Ministry of Labour to the Gre@@ ens Bundest@@ ags in Ann@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ ck more than six tons of mer@@ cur@@ y in the year consisting of two @-@ thirds of the total @-@ quantity in Germany .
the concentration of mer@@ cur@@ y fish in fish approximately in Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the Der Spiegel had quoted in March of the paper .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings from Mercury in fish have already been among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system R@@ AS@@ FF .
