for the opening of the in Article 28 fixed target , the material book@@ keeping can be used as a secure measure of fundamental importance , verbal alignment with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation of important comple@@ mentary measures .
the technical finish of the re@@ inspec@@ tions by the organization is conducted by an explanation , in which for any type of material , which is performed for a specified period of material , stating the accuracy of the accuracy of the specified measurement .
in the implementation of their inspec@@ tions , the organisation makes for articles 3 full use of the security system of the community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material zones .
in the application of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and actions will make the following kinds of use , and as far as required , as far as required , are more likely to be defined and pur@@ pose@@ ful in the comple@@ ment@@ ing arrangements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ ated , sl@@ ated , lost , lost or in other ways from stock of remote nuclear material and the inventory ;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the estim@@ ation of measurement certainty ;
C ) Proc@@ edure for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of the sender and recipients ;
e ) Proc@@ edure for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations not reported stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that indicate the core materi@@ al@@ ness and changes of the material , including the one - and out@@ puts of the material composition ;
( g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that the accounting procedures and process agreements are correctly carried out ;
h ) method for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with the items 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures based on this Convention are not related to material in the mining industry or in the treatment preparation .
B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ory material that described under the letter c ) described phase of the kernel of the kernel @-@ cycle , divided into the states , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided that it does not apply to specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the acquisition phase , in which it is produced , or is introduced into the state material or other , in a later phase of the kernel @-@ circular core material in the States , so it is subject to the other contained in this Convention .
a ) The backup measures referred to in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . these conditions are not possible , however , that the re@@ mind@@ ing of nuclear material , the backup measures following this Convention is not possible or desirable , so consult the organization and the community on the use of appropriate backup measures .
( B ) The backup measures proposed in this Convention shall be concluded under the conditions stated in Article 13 , provided the organisation and the community will notice that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ refundable .
at the request of the community the organization liber@@ ates the basic material from the backup measures following this Convention :
a ) special split material when used in grams - or smaller amounts of sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities following Article 13 , if such nuclear material is rep@@ lic@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
looking for the community the organization of nuclear material , the otherwise backup measures would be subject to this Convention , of this backup measures , provided the entire , due to this article in the states of the core materi@@ ally at no time more than
a ) a total of a kilograms of special material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ chment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying his weight with the enri@@ chment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enri@@ chment , which is under 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural uran lies , calculated by multi@@ plying his weight with the twenty @-@ one square of the enri@@ chment ;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural uran and de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ anium with an enri@@ chment of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons of de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ anium with an enri@@ chment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should liber@@ ated nuclear material , together with nuclear material , which under@@ lies the backup measures following this agreement , processed or stored , such procedures will be made for the re@@ application of backup measures on that material .
the community lies with the organization of supple@@ mental agreements , which are required to apply to the extent that requires the successful and effective identification of the tasks of the organization after this Convention is defined in each framework which apply the procedures established in the Convention .
supple@@ mental agreements may be extended or modified without amendment of this Convention in the association between the organization and the community .
the comple@@ ment@@ ing arrangements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States shall undertake all efforts to enter into force nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this convention ; an extension of this period requires the balance between the organization , the community and the states .
the organisation is based on the basis of the first @-@ mentioned initial survey of the entire , the security measures of this convention on the core material , in the states , regardless of its origin , and results on this inventory , due to the subsequent reports and the results of their inspec@@ tions .

agreement in the form of a brie@@ fing between the European Economic Community and the Bank of International Sett@@ lements on the mobilization of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the financial @-@ term financial burden .
the B@@ IS could close Stand@@ by @-@ loan agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor banks if banks face a corresponding request .
the Agreement could be closed down to the total amount of the income paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2,@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this is equivalent to 50 % of all future aspirations of the member countries .
but even now , below are some conditions referred to as the B@@ IS would be ready .
with each stand@@ by @-@ loan , the BI@@ Z would initially take an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , but without being exceeded for a total of five years .
at the opening of the credits as well as with the extension of the renewal , the BI@@ Z would charge a credit opening .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draw ends will not be made before the end of a month after conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can manage the necessary adjustments of their own liqui@@ dity .
the deposits would occur in the currencies available at the conclusion of the agreement , most likely in U.S. dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would meet those that the B@@ IS aimed at the specific time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market operations .
if the BI@@ Z must provide the necessary means even on the market itself , then the next interest rate could achieve a maximum , which corresponds to a corresponding margin of increased Li@@ bor .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit agreement with the central banks of the credi@@ tor banks if banks face a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to inform me of the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a re@@ agent for the blood @-@ group@@ determination must react with all the tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which has the antibodies or another on the label stated substance .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by more and renewed di@@ lution of the seeking re@@ agent on the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the re@@ zi@@ pro@@ ke value of the number of strongest ser@@ um fertili@@ zation , in which a reaction occurs ; the fertili@@ zation is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood @-@ body in@@ und@@ ated in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on object , the activity is required by the time that is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object @-@ bearer .
the World Health Organization has set up for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents to the dis@@ group@@ determination of international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity is worked out at present standards .
a specific standard tool according to definition contains a certain number of national units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents in determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution during a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ ten@@ fold .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic invisible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents to the blood group determination , available for the International Standard Edition ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the titles of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the International Standard apparatus or a state of state apparatus in International units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .

a Re@@ agen@@ z is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , so its necessary properties should remain at least one year long .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in cur@@ es@@ si@@ ger form according to label is most likely a year after the last satisfactory efficiency test .
that on the label depic@@ tion exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents , according to the results of fe@@ asi@@ bility trials ; it is approved by government supervis@@ ory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of iner@@ ated gas or in a vacuum , and in the glass containers that they have dried up and that it is closed , that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent can lose most of 0.5 b.@@ H. of his weight if it is tested by another drying of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
for the avoidance of bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the re@@ agent ( or those supplied with the dry re@@ agents provided ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic used , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance will continue to be the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for the blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or rec@@ er@@ dissolved serv@@ ings .
re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in a fluid form or after the re@@ solution , must be transparent and must contain neither sedi@@ ments nor g@@ ele or visible particles .
the purpose of re@@ agents for the international exchange of specific re@@ agents , should not be colored as artificial , at least as long as not until an internation@@ alist Convention has come about a uniform system .
re@@ agents on the blood group determination can be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that , in a container , not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells .
the quantity contained in one tank must be so great that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy testing in this protocol .
the company &apos;s labor@@ atory has on all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to lead to the blood @-@ group@@ determination of written records .
adequate rehear@@ s@@ als of all repository re@@ agents are so long taken from the laboratory to keep up with some likelihood is that the char@@ ger is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for bleeding can contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary tools for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of re@@ agent .
for technical reasons , this re@@ agents are split into three groups according to the origin of their effective investment .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents may contain no substances human origin .
on each individual tank , a black on white printed label in English and French is to be attached , the following information contains : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the needed fluid ,
