this document is a summary of the European public Pub@@ lication report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the pack@@ et ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to decrease ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. po@@ ised thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disease , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal al@@ right ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
bili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe mal@@ onic episodes and the prevention of disaster in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
injection resolution is applied to fast control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
with both diseases , the solution can be applied to sub@@ mitting or melt @-@ coated tablets in patients making the slip of tablets difficulties .
patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffering from patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines that are just as bili@@ fy should be adapted to the dose of bili@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works mainly as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter Dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters effect to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin from schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole carries in to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and their re @-@ act is prevented .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy , the re @-@ emergence of symptoms , was examined in three studies through up to one year .
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting trig@@ gers was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared to increased agitation , over a period of two hours using a placebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been compared twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operating dol , in another study the efficacy of bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients where the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of bili@@ fy injection solution was made in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered in increased rest@@ lessness , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
for all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined by a standard sc@@ ala disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment outcomes .
the company also led studies to investigate how the body resor@@ bed to the melting tablets and the solution to the inser@@ tion .
in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients received a placebo .
during the application of the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder diminished A@@ bili@@ fy in four of the five short @-@ time studies man@@ ic symptoms are more effective than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re @-@ emergence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , extr@@ amar@@ isk ( un@@ contro@@ l@@ eness ) , se@@ dation ( hardness ) , nau@@ tical secre@@ tion ( increased saliva ) , fatigue and fatigue , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the committee for humanitarian aid ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of bili@@ fy in treating schizophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in those the man@@ ic episodes of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole said to ou@@ twei@@ gh the risks .
in addition , the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection resolution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ oral disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not appropriate to ou@@ twei@@ gh the risks .
June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for approval by A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of the meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of the meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ als should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ction behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suffici@@ ency with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ) , cerebral vas@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for Hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressur@@ ised medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ i@@ dered and mal@@ ignant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was a year or less lasting , there were occasional reports during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l asc@@ ending dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia .
if in a case with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ ll should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs must be dis@@ continued .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in cases with severe cases in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or with accidents , which are associated with severe cases with caution .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an elevated mortality rate compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relation between the dosage and the response for unwanted rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l @-@ treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ y or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ specific undes@@ irable events treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , the direct comparisons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ureth@@ ral and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration in glucose levels .
gaining weight gain is generally with schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ tis , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally eff@@ ec@@ tual drugs called se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ p@@ tions@@ rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is however not relevant as clin@@ ically .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers increased a high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l around 107 % , while the C@@ max left unchanged .
it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine @-@ tin , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ er can result in the common use of high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metals .
if you consider the common use of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should ou@@ twei@@ gh the potential risks for the patient .
other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions .
after dra@@ fting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be raised to the Dos@@ age at the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 will be given together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day have no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data base on safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the re@@ production studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless its potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , patients should be warned of dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects are more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as potential medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the incidence of side @-@ down side @-@ effects is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks with patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ema and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS amoun@@ ted to 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under o@@ con@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS increased 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term initial phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS amoun@@ ted to 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zol@@ kin treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo .
a comparison between the people &apos;s groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , revealed not medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ opho@@ bic kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole @-@ treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
to the side effects which can appear in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also was reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the launch of the launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dose were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
while there is no information on the effectiveness of a tick @-@ testing in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; it is unlikely , however , that her@@ edi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has high plasma @-@ formation .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is conve@@ yed .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 recept@@ or and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ or and an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and to hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recept@@ or .

in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a semi @-@ operating dol @-@ controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients showing a response to the study medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ ab dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary study programs , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery Az@@ berg@@ - Head@@ quarters , showed a significant stronger improvement than with the semi @-@ operating dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of the back rate indicated by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and at 57 % below placebo .

in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole one opposite placebo superior effectiveness in reducing sperm symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ otherapy study on 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior effectiveness versus placebo .
in two plac@@ e@@ and active mon@@ otherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a clue effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ oper@@ dol in week 12 .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also referred to 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ie on such as lithium or semi @-@ operating dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features which , in part over 2 weeks , did not respond to Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ ach Mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic ser@@ um , yiel@@ ded an superior effectiveness in reducing sperm symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks with man@@ ic patients suffering from margin@@ alisation phase ahead of margin@@ alisation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed up to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar backward case , predominantly in preventing a relap@@ se in the mania .
based on in vit@@ ro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydro@@ xy@@ ch of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ dy is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the average elimination period is about approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive met@@ abol@@ isi@@ es over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approxim@@ ate 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the phar@@ ma @-@ disorder between male and female healthy volunteers , and showed no gender @-@ dependent effects during a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination of schizophren@@ ic patients .
a @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics revealed not an indication of clin@@ ically significant differences concerning the ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharmaceutical field of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study with Pro@@ ban@@ den with various liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function at the drug co@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study embr@@ aced only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y inj@@ ecting solution is applied to fast control of ap@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder , if a oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically attached , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injections should be completed and started with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to boost the resi@@ ding and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ id or deep into the Glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under byp@@ assing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0,@@ 7 ml ) can depend on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used already for maintenance or ak@@ ut therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection resolution in patients suffering from schizophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder .
if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection resolution is necessary as necessary , patients should be observed regarding extreme sea@@ weed or blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection resolution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ) , cerebral vas@@ cular diseases , conditions that are used for Hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood @-@ pressur@@ ised medicines ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ i@@ dered and mal@@ ignant form ) .

poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ureth@@ ral and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration in glucose levels .
gaining weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ tis , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs where weight gain is known as a side @-@ effect and could lead to serious complications .

the efficacy of my@@ x@@ ane was evaluated in a main study , attended by 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters in the past had been an Anth@@ rac@@ er .
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ some gift , respectively as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug @-@ pac@@ lit@@ axel drug ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with abra@@ sive patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , the conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines .
looking at only the patients who have been treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , in patients who had previously obtained other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators , that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines .
it may also not be applied for patients who have a low or before the start of the treatment low Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ rolled in the blood .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) established that my@@ x@@ ane in patients where the first treatment is no longer inv@@ oked , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel medicines was and that it must not be given in contrast to other chemotherapy ( chemotherapy ) drugs to reduce side effects .
January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Inter@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited issued a permit for marketing of my@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .

the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the drug is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ balance , ab@@ se@@ amed was inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
injection can also be made by the patient or its supervis@@ or provided they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving a chemotherapy , the here@@ of @-@ bell values should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l in children ) .
the iron values of all patients are prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron shortage consists , and iron utilities should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients suffering from chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thropo@@ i@@ od@@ ine deficiency or by causing the body not sufficiently on the body @-@ owned er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thropo@@ ie@@ tin is also applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells , thus reducing the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) that provides them to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was referred to as an injection in a v@@ ein as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from renal problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study was in@@ ject at least eight weeks to E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a negotiated inj@@ ected before they were either filed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indication for the effectiveness was the change in the hem@@ at@@ bell values between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also placed the results of a study in which the effects led by under the skin with pr@@ amed ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients were received .
in the study involving patients who suffered from renal problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glo@@ om@@ bin@@ ds of patients who were killed in the same measure , as for those patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .

the most common side @-@ effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opath@@ ies ( brain problems ) such as sudden , continuous mig@@ rain@@ ous headaches and con@@ fu@@ sions .
ab@@ duc@@ tors may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
dis@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that by no allergic reactions are triggered .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that voting in compliance with the provisions of the European Union is proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , the ref@@ amed , will provide information on the safety of the drug in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness that makes the bones spr@@ ink@@ le ) both in women after men@@ opause and in men .
it is applied to patients with a high risk risk ( bone bur@@ sts ) , including patients who have recently suffered a lesser trau@@ matic hat@@ s as they fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ y should be a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting in a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ amin@@ os@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the three days after the in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle aches , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ al symptoms , joint pain and headaches .
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta is only prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data material for Zom@@ eta was brought to the evaluation of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study was involved almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it examined the number of vor@@ tices and frac@@ tures over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had recently suffered a frac@@ ture . it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years .
in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 35@@ 7 patients and compared to six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the salary of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase in the ser@@ um ( a enzyme that builds the bone substance ) in the blood again , or by at least 75 % compared to the output value .
in the study with older women the risk of vor@@ tices at patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the people affected by placebo .
in comparison of all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those among placebo the risk of frac@@ tures reduced by 41 % .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of acet@@ one occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common at repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs or other buff@@ phosph@@ ates or any of the other components .
as with all Bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients in Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney failure , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ opathy ( ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors who pres@@ cribe Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence contains how the drug use , as well as a similar material for patients , in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
April 2005 , the European Commission granted the European Commission of Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited granted approval for the transpor@@ ting of Ac@@ la@@ sta in the entire European Union .

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic figure , the administration of the In@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended twice or more weeks after the operating supply of the frac@@ ture frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following an treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long pension period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , to ensure twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in patients with a recent exp@@ atri@@ ate low @-@ traumati@@ zing frac@@ ture , a Initi@@ al dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the incidence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by G@@ acet@@ amin@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney @-@ dys@@ functions ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In case of patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended , since limited clinical experience are available for these patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A Dos@@ is@@ adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and young people Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for use in children and young people under the age of 18 , since data are lacking in un@@ certainties and effectiveness .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as for this patient population has limited limited clinical experience .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is concerned before the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the beginning of therapy with a sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone cultivation , a temporary hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , to ensure twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer treatment , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , bad oral hygiene ) should be assessed before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate pre @-@ ventil@@ ated dental treatment .
for patients who need dental surgery , no data are available , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk for oste@@ opathy in the jaw .
clinical evaluation by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan for each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and placebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) of adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney @-@ compul@@ sive disorder was associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in Ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure , in connection .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical trial in oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the group and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in Ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the Gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in contrast to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels , which occurred below the normal variation division ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study , compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recent exp@@ iring frac@@ tures , the vitamin D @-@ Spiegel were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a initi@@ ating dose vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion location , such as redness , swelling and / or ache , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the case of Gel@@ eg@@ ated was mainly studied in cancer patients , via oste@@ opathy ( primary in the max@@ im area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth @-@ art or other dental surgery .
7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ wer@@ case with one of Ac@@ la@@ sta and one with placebo @-@ treated patients .
in the event of an over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , can be compens@@ ated for compensation by oral calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ at .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) - The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( BM@@ D ) ) with either one bone density or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Schengen passport @-@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing cycl@@ ist infrastructure .
effects on morph@@ ological vor@@ tices Ac@@ la@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or more new vor@@ tices ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % decreased risk of verteb@@ rates as compared with placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on the frac@@ tures of the Ac@@ la@@ sta reported a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in an by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % up to 58 % ) reduced risk of frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar cl@@ ei@@ c acid , hips and the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo treatment significantly to all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 raise the bone density of the Len@@ den@@ cy Battle at 6.@@ 7 % , the total r@@ ump around 6.@@ 0 % , the donation to 5.@@ 1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.@@ 2 % .
bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis have been treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of Knochen@@ bi@@ op@@ sies from the pelvic fireplace .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed up patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison to placebo an increase in bone mar@@ row and the preservation of trans@@ former bone architecture .
bone substitute mark@@ er The bones @-@ specific al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ season Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in Ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ ep@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in Ser@@ um were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals .
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significant by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial price by 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial print until 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
vitamin D mir@@ rors were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 per cent or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the tot@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D is at the total rin@@ ist and Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ als at all times .
the action plan led more than 24 months in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment in an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % of the total and um 4.@@ 3 % on the donation .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were random@@ ized , 50@@ 8 men random@@ ized and at 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % at placebo .
in a different study in men ( study C@@ Z@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta in comparison with once weekly G@@ end@@ ron@@ ine referred to the percentage change of the steering wir@@ bel BM@@ D after 24 months , compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the Kno@@ chens Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically clear mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean ser@@ um @-@ mirror of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2,@@ 6@@ 95 up to 3,@@ 0@@ 80 &apos;s specific upper worth while recording in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Zol@@ el@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risk ron@@ utri@@ ents once daily during 2 months was detected in two @-@ month comparison studies .
the combined results has been observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain and pain management compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients , which were classified at the end of the month &apos;s main study as Res@@ p@@ onder ( on the therapy addressed ) , could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be maintained at 141 of the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age , aged 18 months after application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs @-@ acid in 64 patients found the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel took off quickly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

the early distribution phases ( α and ß ) , with the above ( ½ values ) represent probably the fast Res@@ or@@ ption in the bone and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
during the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the dose of urine can be tied in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the overall body @-@ Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.0 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs of customs and concentration by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration by time ) .
a diminished Clear@@ ance of due to Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ ous substances is unlikely , because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a watch@@ ful or even no direct and / or irrever@@ sible , the inter@@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ th

Zol@@ el@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ Class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ ates , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sexual hormones , especially o@@ estrogen , which are formed from andro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone construction is done too quickly , and new bone material is set in sub@@ ordin@@ ated , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alized the bone construction , creating a normal bone formation , and gives the bones again strength .
if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
with application of Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if you take other medicines / apply / applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know whether you are taking medications from which they are ashamed of the kidneys .
with the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and beverages you worry that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you will have sufficient fluid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hips , will be recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the ridge .

in patients with a recently exp@@ atri@@ ated low @-@ trau@@ matic figure it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operational care of the frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be supplied sufficiently with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid entry of the effect of Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone cultivation , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ine disease can develop , their maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , to ensure at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ trau@@ matic figure , a initial dose is recommended from 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D in front of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public - this document is a summary of the European Public Health Auth@@ orities ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the studies conducted for Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) , in order to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
account is applied for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied only ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) are applied together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ al ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) that can be adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin , insulin can be maintained with the onset of account treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ otic or insulin is to be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s body can be improved in better and the blood sugar levels , whereby type @-@ 2 diabetes is better set .
more than 1 400 patients have examined the efficacy of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl , in addition they received either account for up to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or placebo .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
account led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar values were reduced in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ist showed at 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional G@@ abe of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insulin in 2@@ 89 patients was examined , patients who took account in addition to insulin , a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patient , which also took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with accounts were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , gaining weight and hypo@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) .
accounts may not be applied to patients who may possibly be super@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure , or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ y ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
October 2000 , the European Commission awarded the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to distribute Ac@@ tos by Ac@@ tos in the European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for combination associated with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted and in@@ appropriate at the met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain or furn@@ ace , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and oils , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin .
cardiovascular out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease has been performed .
this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver disease ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased to the 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control again .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepati@@ c dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , torso , loss of appetite and / or darker hard@@ n , the liver enzymes are checked .
the decision whether the patient treatment is continuing with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be led up to the pres@@ cri@@ bing parameters of clinical assessment .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that can be found by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid re@@ tention .
as a result of a tick , the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one occurred slightly reduction of the middle hem@@ o@@ bell values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in comparative @-@ controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % ) and to a lower extent also in patients among sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3 % ) .
as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitivity consists in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ist or as a branch @-@ processing therapy with insulin , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the launch of the market , it was reported under the treatment of Thi@@ ac@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , about an occurrence or a deterioration of an anti@@ diabe@@ tic mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity .
it is unclear whether there are direct correlation between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report about interference in visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic assessment should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable events regarding bone frac@@ tures , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the reduced frac@@ tures of 1.9 tri@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on were treated to women and 1.7 frac@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years in women , who were treated with a compar@@ atively drug .
in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.7 % ; 0.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a compar@@ atively medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to do a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be reached ( see Section 4.@@ 6 ) .
studies of investigation of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effects on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ami@@ m are not expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one to the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reduces the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in mat@@ urely and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fat growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally , 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data does not be invaluable ) .
these lead to a temporary variation in the tur@@ g@@ or and brake inde@@ xes of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one played AL@@ T @-@ ups over the thre@@ e@@ fold the upper limit of the standard range often on like among placebo but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ phones .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mak@@ vas@@ cular disease the incidence was a severe heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to 1.6 % higher than under placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
since the launch of the market , it has rarely been reported on con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
there was a summary analysis of reports of undes@@ irable events regarding bone brood , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and about 7.@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ atively medication .
in the over a period of 3.5 years running pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2,5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ atively medication .

pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to function through an activation of specific kernel @-@ recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensi@@ tiveness of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be demonstrated that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose recovery in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , a blood sugar check was defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the patients treated under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in an plac@@ e@@ controlled study on 12 months , patients whose blood sugar have been inadequate , despite a three @-@ month improvement phase with insulin , to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo random@@ ized .
patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced the average H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients , who continue only insulin ; a reduction in insulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
clinical trials over a year showed below pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on through a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ons compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was evaluated in a small , 18 weeks essay by type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma @-@ gly@@ cem@@ ic acids and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as tri@@ vial , however clin@@ ically observed significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels .
clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide the total plas@@ en@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels .
compared to placebo , there is no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed while using met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide diminished values were observed .
in a study more than 20 weeks the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is not only the so@@ ber @-@ electric tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the bi@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ zation level , this both via an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ d absorption or the hepati@@ c Tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease were random@@ ized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the top con@@ centric pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one usually reaches 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV does not correspond to the efficacy of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II minimal is marked .
Inter@@ aktions@@ studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ ou@@ mon and Met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radio@@ active pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in subjects ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is about man 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the entire active met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral Clear@@ ance of the mother sub@@ substance but resem@@ ble .
in to@@ xi@@ ological studies played with mice , rats , dogs and apes after repeated administration , plasma @-@ enhancement with ha@@ em@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible cardi@@ ac hyper@@ trop@@ hia .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces the hyper@@ ins@@ ul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in mat@@ urely and thus reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fat growth .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e was involved in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type 1 diabetes for which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to utilize that insulin is effectively used .
in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced with another human@@ ist .
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e should not be applied in patients who may respond to human @-@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Human@@ ity ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e may also be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar ( the full list is available on pack @-@ age ) .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the treatment of diabetes are ou@@ twei@@ gh the risks .
October 2002 , the European Commission awarded the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to distribute Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e in the European Union .
preliminary insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day when a rapid initi@@ als effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle must be at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar can be significantly improved by an intensified insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia @-@ War@@ n@@ symptoms may be altered and should be advised accordingly .
any change with regard to strength , trademark ( producer ) , insulin or insulin ( rapid insulin , long @-@ acting insulin , long @-@ acting insulin , human insulin or insulin delivery ) , type of insulin ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA toward insulin origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if the switch to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ e is required in the patient with a dosage adjustment , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
some patients where hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions came after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning @-@ symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , the patient should go over several time@@ zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that insulin can be applied or taken to other times .
the doctor therefore must consider possible interactions in the therapy and ask for his patients asking for other medicines .

the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the duration of the duration is up to 24 hours .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
October 2002 , the European Commission awarded the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to distribute Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ide in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin is mixed , first the quantity of insulin must first be raised , then the amount of insulin can subsequently be applied .
3 If changing to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id in the patient is required , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching .
before travelling , the patient should go over several time@@ zones , the patient should be advised to get the advice of his doctor , since such trips can lead to that insulin can be applied or taken to other times .

a clinical trial in an intensive care centre for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic patients , which induced by intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id ( blood sugar 4.@@ 4 - 6.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the mortality rate by 42 % ( 8 % compared to 4.@@ 6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the active maximum will be reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and teenagers The pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id became involved in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , however , suggest that the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults alike .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already been signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ble deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tox@@ ins ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. greater ur@@ at@@ rop@@ abl@@ ings that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ inary tract is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ on@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , toxicity can still occur ; therefore , patients are advised to take at least during the first six months under the treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic nor further medicines to reduce tox@@ ics .
the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant since it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy was tri@@ pled between various aden@@ ur@@ ic @-@ doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) with that of a placebo ( hypo@@ medicines ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( any other drug for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic were compared daily 80 and 120 mg ) one year compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily , 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary level in the blood was under the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who captured aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once posted a ur@@ inary level of 120 mg each day , in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l .
compared to this , this was about 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
especially in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects which affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .

there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage of the ser@@ um @-@ mammals of Pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their renal function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .
primary end @-@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ con@@ centric ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l About 40 % of patients ( AP@@ AR@@ Y and fact @-@ study ) had to study ( Bas@@ eline ) a ser@@ um @-@ clean @-@ concentration of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
the data collected in two years from the open renewal study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 required treatment against a poison gas ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ love delay ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the poison centre , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the poison notes by month 24 .
increased T@@ SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.@@ 5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term prevention studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with healthy subjects increased the maximum plasma @-@ con@@ centric ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma @-@ con@@ centric time curve ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C that is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportionate increase .
after in@@ gesting simple or multi @-@ cou@@ pl@@ ers of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage decline of ser@@ um @-@ acid concentration , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution system ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is in the range of 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein@@ ation from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached via the concentration of concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

special patient groups of kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg A@@ DE@@ N@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to Pro@@ ban@@ den with normal kidney function .
the mid @-@ range AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ times from 7.5 μ in the h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ in the h / ml in the group with severe kidney @-@ function .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are brood @-@ ig ) in women after men@@ opause , in which a risk exists for a low vitamin D @-@ level .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or disposable of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin in@@ supple@@ mentary ) .
in order to avoid a irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , placed the company data from earlier studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 males and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase of vitamin D reflections .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment the proportion of patients had been treated with low vitamin D @-@ level in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , less ( 11 % ) than those who received exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age ( 32 % ) .
the company also put data to the fact that in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE contained al@@ end@@ ron@@ at @-@ dose is exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone loss .
the most common side @-@ effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal he@@ alt ( muscles , bones , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ ff@@ ness , diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , ul@@ cer@@ ation ( b@@ lower stomach ) , so@@ ggy abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower stomach ) as well as su@@ ck @-@ up .
in patients with multiple over@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
it may not be applied in diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( small calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up or sit at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only equipped with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or loss of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium , and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
following tips are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swal@@ lowed up after the day of the day with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not crash the tablet , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ foam inf@@ al@@ tra@@ kt except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , only be given in particular caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ ps , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate ( partially , this severe and required a hospital reference ) .
the doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms , which should point out on possible mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , pain at the slip or backward pain , or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ ening the medicine and obtain medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ös@@ s side @-@ effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it depends on the occurrence of symptoms that will refer to an os@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is important that all instruc@@ tional instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large areas of clinical studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , no increased risk was observed , were rarely ( after market launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications , reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ opathy of the jaw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy ime predominantly given intraven@@ ously with bis@@ phosph@@ ates .
there are no data available to give the evidence whether the inser@@ tion of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a jaw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opathy or jaw .
clinical assessment by the pres@@ cri@@ bing doctor is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be advised that they are supposed to take the tablet during the failure of taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet the next morning after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned to carry on the week@@ day .
other diseases , which affect the mineral change ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) , should be treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE as well .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids , and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the resi@@ ding of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age if they are taken at the same time .
therefore patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific intervention studies have not been performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical studies along with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without having to clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore is neither used during pregnancy or nursing women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ age do not allow any indication of directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ opathy of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ ates ; most of the reports have been reported by cancer patients , but also on oste@@ opor@@ osis as well .
nevertheless , the Ser@@ um @-@ calcium took up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the ser@@ um phosph@@ ate to &lt; 2.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 0,@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at as a oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ no@@ th@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side @-@ effects in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ wers such as stomach burning , so@@ d@@ burn , o@@ stri@@ tis or Ul@@ zer@@ a .

the effects of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at on bone mass and fra@@ gment in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ tional intervention ( s = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in Phase III studies the moderate increase of BM@@ D with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate 10 mg / day in proportion to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.5 % of the spine , 5,@@ 9 % on the Fem@@ ur@@ h@@ als und 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in comparison to the placebo group , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo 6.@@ 2 % ) were achieved by the proportion of patients who have suffered one or more spine .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies conducted the depth of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to ; also the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body has been maintained .
fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ed trials , where al@@ end@@ ron@@ age daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily continue to be taken either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study the daily gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was reduced to the appearance of at least one new vor@@ tices around 47 % ( Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at 7.@@ 9 % against placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resi@@ ding related to a intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average or@@ ale bio@@ availability of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age at women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after consuming fast@@ ings and two hours before taking a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
the bio@@ availability rose according to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age has been taken one or half an hour before a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ os@@ estu@@ di@@ ums , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking during the day .
with healthy volunteers , the gift of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily about five days ) does not lead to a clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age ( increase in funding in the range of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats have revealed that Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age is divided according to intraven@@ ous G@@ abe of 1 mg / kg temporarily in cros@@ sover , but then moved rapidly into the bone or eliminated with urine .
after intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ active substance marked within 72 hours with urine , and little or no radio activity was found in the subjects .
according to intraven@@ ous gift of a single dose of 10 mg the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing house did not reach 200 ml / min .
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is not eliminated with rats or bas@@ ic transportation system of the kidneys , and therefore it is not accepted that people affected the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines through these transport systems .

characteristics in patients of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , who is not depos@@ ited in the bone , eliminated rapidly beyond urine .
although no clinical data is available about it , it is nonetheless reck@@ oned that the renal elimination of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age as in the animal try to be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .

Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered adult patients whose kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ lication of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ f have already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study carried out to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney planning is submitted , whereas the use of ad@@ vag@@ raf is compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients where the transp@@ l@@ ant was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of a year ( by example examined how often a new organ transp@@ l@@ ant or a res@@ ump@@ tion of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
in addition , more recent studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney l@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transp@@ l@@ ant treatment and examined like Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft by the body .

in patients with several hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be used .
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ raf as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the simultaneously purchased drugs must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ tation patients should do this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transp@@ l@@ apping or an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ masch@@ ige inspec@@ tions of an experienced physician of the transp@@ l@@ ant ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of an adjustment to an alternative formulation , there must be a therapeutic monitoring and appropriate dosage adap@@ tations to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on the clinical assessment of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability in individual cases and blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low should be controlled before switching and over two weeks to switch .
on day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a mirror @-@ level , with both form@@ ulations either in both kidney and hair transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ mirror @-@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vag@@ raf in order to ensure proper substance exposure to the direct re@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post @-@ surgical procedure , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) are introduced with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application of cent@@ red repression of the transp@@ l@@ apping must be maintained . consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
Dos@@ age recommendations - kidney l@@ ant Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of transp@@ l@@ essen The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations can be required later as the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient following the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transp@@ l@@ ant Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tat@@ too sto@@ cking The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0,@@ 10 - 0,@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ age recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be a transplan@@ tation of twice daily dosage from Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this switch compared to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , to take place .
kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant After an adjustment of other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants at Ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ raf once daily needs to start treatment with each in kidney and liver transp@@ l@@ ant initi@@ als dose for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ ade .
heart transp@@ l@@ ant In adult patients , which are placed on Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning .
other Tran@@ splan@@ ade recept@@ ors although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung cancer , pan@@ eling and col@@ onic patients in a oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,@@ 2 mg / kg / day and in intestinal over@@ rides in an oral Initi@@ al dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / day to use .
dosage adap@@ tations in special patient groups with reduced liver function z@@ ur maintenance of blood cells in the advanced field can be required in patients with severe liver @-@ dys@@ functions a lowering of the dose .
patients with limited kidney function since the kidney function has no influence on the phar@@ ma @-@ c@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , it can be assumed that a tin @-@ adap@@ tion is not required .
because of the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential than from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the renal function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um cancer levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in and a monitoring of the bladder &apos;s volume ) is recommended .
switch of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf In case of switching from a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is caution . ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations regarding the mirror in full @-@ bl@@ ut The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ay@@ ence and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full @-@ bl@@ ut Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level checks .
there is recommended common controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ mirror during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ testosterone levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also change after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with the simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ blood ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments the dose can need several days until the Ste@@ ady State occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the testosterone levels in blood will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice the Tal@@ mud of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in n@@ die @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
while the dar@@ ing maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were usually used sub@@ con@@ centric in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to severe undes@@ irable events including transp@@ l@@ utes or other side @-@ effects which can occur in consequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m sub@@ - or exposure .
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of formulation or regime should only be made under the eng@@ masch@@ ige inspec@@ tions of an experienced physician of the transp@@ l@@ ant ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 Z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transplan@@ ted power , which proved to be proven to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants as a re@@ frac@@ tory , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
prophy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tat@@ too sto@@ cking at adult cardi@@ ac graf@@ ting recei@@ vers and transplan@@ tive recept@@ ors in childhood are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
because of possible interactions formed by lowering the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) are included , or other plant remedies available during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood offered , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m blood levels can be subject to significant fluctu@@ ations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f , it was a cardi@@ ac or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which therefore can also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ ab@@ raf .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart suffer , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid exposure and o@@ estrogen .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ s@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted to the potential risk of potential risk alter@@ ations by suitable clothes or using a solar protection factor with a high protection factor .
if patients are taking the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ ache , altered state of consciousness , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g .
since Ad@@ vag@@ raf carbide , re@@ tar@@ ded , lac@@ tose is included is available in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ ac@@ tose intolerance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ ac@@ tose mal@@ ware .
the simultaneous use of drugs or herbal remedies known as the inhibit@@ or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ m and thus increase the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .

since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can put down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase the hormone exposure , making decisions particularly cautious at decisions on recep@@ tive measures .
the outcomes of veterin@@ arians have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially decrease the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and prolon@@ ging their half @-@ time .

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a lack of factor VIII , innate blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application are according to whether they are used to treat bleeding or to the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems like bleeding in the joints , muscles or inner organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene ( DNA ) , which makes it possible to form the formation of human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Re@@ gre@@ ate , but it is made differently , so that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies to patients with severe to medium @-@ sized H@@ ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated with the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood@@ sep@@ tic with &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ lu@@ te ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII .
Adv@@ ate may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster@@ y or one of the other components .
March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval of Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for approval by Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution treatment are directed after the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
with the following ugly events , the factor VIII is supposed to sink under the specified plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel ( in % of the norm or in - / d@@ l ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeating until the pain and acute draw@@ backs are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
during the treatment process , the dose of the injections and the frequency of the injections are given an appropriate provision of the factor VIII plates .
individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo Recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis use prophy@@ la@@ xis use of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VIII is not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled by a proper dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions need to be wo@@ ken .
the velocity of arrangement should be adjusted according to the patient , whereby a maximum inj@@ ecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which is quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) pro ml plasma , using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
developing the risk , inhibit@@ ors to develop cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereas the risk within the first 20 expres@@ days is on the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors .
in the patients treated ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nesty , known inhibit@@ ors , to switch from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ emergence of ( low @-@ ti@@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors observed .
due to the rare occurrence of the ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A among women , there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who were all concerned with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence on the basis of available data is not estim@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of each patient ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected waste of the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VIII is post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ operative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting has been maintained throughout time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma as well as the clearing @-@ rate showed sufficient values on 15 post@@ operative day .

previously untreated patients of a current clinical study made 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients treated in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII .
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ tres against these proteins , laboratory parameters and measured side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant war@@ dness as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were isolated over the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es Gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the study .

based on the data available since the initial version of the CH@@ MP , the CH@@ MP has continued to be positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s all 6 months required , that the authorisation is to apply for a further renewal procedure for 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited gave the Committee on Human@@ ity &apos;s ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company withdraw its request for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to treat Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the past@@ oral parts ( tissues that connect other structures in the body , surrounds and bases ) thereof .
it is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically so that it can carry one gene into the cells of the body .
in the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in , it is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified to make no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
advance should have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein that is formed from the not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 @-@ gene usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 @-@ gene defect is broken , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company laid out data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of the tree , into the bones and in the brain .
after CH@@ MP has examined the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial documents the CH@@ MP made available to 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company .
according to CH@@ MP , not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ore takes advantage of the patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not proven adequately that Adv@@ ant@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company won &apos;t know the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients have currently in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ing Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; changing active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components are instantly being released and the other slowly being released over a couple of hours .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , due to an allergy to pol@@ len produced inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ d@@ skin swelling ( co@@ op@@ holes ) .
in adults and adolescents 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze is twice daily , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be adjusted to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effectiveness were the changes in the gravity of the ha@@ y fever , which were reported by the patient before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a journal and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ala , how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in case of consideration of all ha@@ y fever , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze took , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 35@@ ,@@ 9 % of the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , patients in aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms at 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % over 26@@ ,@@ 7 % of the patients who took the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed for 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( in@@ peti@@ tion@@ lessness ) , ob@@ struction , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ ep@@ iness ) , in@@ fertility and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseudo @-@ ep@@ he@@ dra or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c substances or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( a different drug for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ ang@@ ed water ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases including hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ genic stroke ( caused by brain bleeding ) or have a risk for a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval for the marketing of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze in the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is generally swal@@ low ( i.e. without breaking away , breaking or che@@ wing ) .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should be applied in due to the lack of data for un@@ certainties and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days since long @-@ term application can take the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin with time .
after decrease the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ as in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy .
this is attribut@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ls such as bro@@ o@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ thic , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other de@@ con@@ den@@ tiva , which are used per@@ oral or nas@@ al as remote rhin@@ ocer@@ os , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective , and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of the aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage .
patients must be informed about that treatment at the appearance of a hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or of p@@ ag@@ ony , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of head@@ ache ) must be dropped .
in the treatment of following patient groups , for the treatment of patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients suffering from hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , Blas@@ en@@ hal@@ ting or Bron@@ de@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese .
aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze can be used at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can prevent otherwise positive reactions to indicators of home actions or reduce their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plas@@ tic@@ entr@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
in the outcomes of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or testing , no significant differences could be determined between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was consumed alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme required for the met@@ abol@@ ism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsi@@ bles has not been identified yet , so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ kop@@ i .
the un@@ certainties of the use of aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , does not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities in comparison to frequency in the normal population .
since Re@@ production studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ tic properties of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be applied in pregnancy .
patients should be elu@@ sive about this , however , that it can occur in very rare cases to a ben@@ om@@ eness which can lead to an impairment of the traffic situation or the ability to use machines .
the symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , diminished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ sions , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings .

a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly probable in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pe@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - dil@@ ation , Hau@@ tr@@ ums , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ posi@@ tional cy@@ to@@ c@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the eagle &apos;s P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aircraft including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was detected by no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase of blood pressure , a T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st or manifestation of a Z@@ NS arousal .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of the aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nose @-@ s@@ akes ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pills in view of the ab@@ stain effect , determined by the nose @-@ s@@ skin , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study for pharmac@@ o@@ genetics from Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ within 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma det@@ ectable .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the fly @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseudo @-@ he@@ he@@ drin did reach 10 days .
in the context of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ specialist study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects , has been found that four subjects of the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is severely contaminated .
a component inter@@ activity study reveals that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin after the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin bio@@ equivalent was exposure to gift of an aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on the conventional studies on security vulner@@ abilities , toxicity , toxicity , and recycl@@ ability allow the pre@@ fabri@@ cation of clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine to recognise no particular haz@@ ards to humans .
the combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components , and the observed effects were in general in connection with the ingredient pseudo @-@ ep@@ he@@ drin .
in reproduced , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was in a dosage of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen .

for children aged 6 to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies at seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies to patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the qu@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance at the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment was determined .
there were other studies submitted to prove that the body adds the sy@@ rup to the solution and the melting tablets in the same way utilized as the tablets and the use in children is harmless .
in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom ( symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the removal of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom was after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components .
January 2001 , the European Commission awarded the European Commissioner SP Europe for approval by A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) .
there are limited experience in clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in for young people aged from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should occur in accordance with the previous disease exp@@ ir@@ ation and may end after the end of symptoms and can be re @-@ recorded at their re @-@ emergence .
in the Persian allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during allergy periods .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in the framework of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were also administered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study a clinical effect was not ampli@@ fied at the current intake of as@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
patients should be elu@@ sive about this , however , that it can occur in very rare cases to ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities , which can lead to an impairment of transport , or the ability to use machines .
clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ ism , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently visited side effects caused more common than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth @-@ drying ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and head@@ ache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 teenage patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side @-@ effect headaches , this occurred at 5.5 % of the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
in a multi @-@ multi@@ dose study , which were administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ posi@@ tional cy@@ to@@ c@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the eagle &apos;s P @-@ selection on endo@@ th@@ eli@@ al cells .
within the framework of a clinical study with multi @-@ disciplinary , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily about 14 days was administered , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effects .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( which was administered over ten days per day , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c Inter@@ v@@ alls was revealed .
in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aircraft including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in relie@@ ving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching of the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms , alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the incidence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as with the total @-@ cor@@ es of the cargo to quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tis was demonstrated , diminished A@@ eri@@ us effectively the exac@@ erb@@ ated by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been analy@@ zing for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ological research regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology with different forms is similar and chron@@ ically patients can be rec@@ tified .
since the hist@@ amine is an important factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , is expected to lead des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in except for chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ ism also in other forms of ur@@ ism to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .

if you forgot the intake of A@@ eri@@ us melt @-@ coated tablet If you have forgotten your dose in time , take it as soon as possible and then follow the normal treatment plan .
on the launch of A@@ eri@@ us very rarely has been reported on cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulties in breathing , wh@@ istle , it@@ ching , net@@ ting and swelling ) and skin rash .
A@@ eri@@ us solution to inclusion is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , teenagers ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution to entry is an application @-@ injection for preparations for inser@@ ting with scal@@ ps , you can use it to take the appropriate amount of solution to take .
regarding the duration of treatment your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that you suffer and will determine after how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness were commonly reported side @-@ effects during adult fatigue , mouth @-@ dry and headaches more often than with placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution to the plug is available in bottles with child @-@ safe sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml package size is a measuring spoon or an application @-@ injection moul@@ ds for inser@@ ting with sc@@ aling ranging from 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml boxes .
June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s Vacc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. are officially distributed to the Committee on Human@@ ity ( CH@@ MP ) officially that the company withdraw its request for approval from A@@ fl@@ in@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied to adults and elderly people to protect flu , which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that could cause a trunk of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic .
Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ pan@@ demic breaks off when a new trunk of influenza is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the parts of the flu @-@ virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; body alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form in contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus of this ordinary antibody .
subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body alien ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not subject to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this led the scope of clinical data base to assess the safety of the vaccine not to comply with the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ demic vaccines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and need further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also component of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medication used for the treatment of adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is indeed available as a solution for disposable , but this can not be taken together with k@@ nights , since the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which anti@@ viral medication has previously taken before , and the likelihood is that the virus will respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medication .
in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of map@@ le according to body weight .
e@@ gener@@ ase decreases in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV volumes in blood and keeps them at a low level .
AIDS is not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system and thus delay the development of suffering from AIDS , infections and disorders .
A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other anti@@ viral medication , but without k@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which were previously not treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms .
the A@@ gener@@ ase inhibit@@ ory increased by 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ mer earlier , with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms compared .
the main indication for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change of virus last after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ yn@@ x , after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral last less than 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children decreased a@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last , but however , treated by the children who were previously treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms , very few on the treatment mentioned .
in the study with adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms , that had been treated with chi@@ on@@ viol@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase the virus last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs :
in the patient with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of virus last after four weeks as with the patients who received their hitherto prot@@ e@@ as@@ lob@@ ster .
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and Fatima gue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 no@@ gener@@ ase may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or drugs , which are just as a@@ gener@@ ase and are detri@@ mental in high concentrations in blood health .
as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase occupy , the risk of a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ opathy ( die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ re@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication used to treat patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ulators to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic ampli@@ fier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee established that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ yn@@ x , not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited granted approval for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication used to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
for usual , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be given to pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r should be performed taking into account the individual viral medication and the pre @-@ treatment of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is around 14 % lower than from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to arrive on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram was not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying add of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
pharmacy , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms have not been studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on uncertainty and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver @-@ dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice a day .
the simultaneous application is to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver @-@ disorder in patients with severe liver @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs which possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations , the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may contain , may not be used due to the risk of reduced plas@@ tic@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and a diminished therapeutic effect of rec@@ tom@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with map@@ le does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination .
for usual , a@@ gener@@ ase capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver impacts with potentially deadly disease .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with previously reduced liver function including a chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ori@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids that changes over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ esis including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ lement of the ad@@ renal function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen .
4 For some medicines , which can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions .
when meth@@ ad@@ on is given simultaneously with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ tion@@ ed symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ts of the a@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be placed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ kes , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases , too whose therapy drugs were required to be associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ cem@@ ia .
B . higher age , and with the medium @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
with h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms , reports of an increase in bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ ters and hem@@ thro@@ ats .
at HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immuno@@ defect can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that lead to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol intake , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ opathy , especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given at the same time with drugs which possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ Iso@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be combined with medicinal drugs whose active ingredients are mostly used via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in was a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a settlement development .
in trying to equi@@ vo@@ ke the humili@@ ated Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel by a dose of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ avi@@ r , very often were observed undes@@ irable effects on the liver .
cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ ran@@ ts ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient is already endor@@ sed by cur@@ wee@@ ds , the spec@@ kled levels are and , if possible to check the virus last and put the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for any of the drugs is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for c@@ max at about 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily applied to the efficacy and un@@ certainties of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as .
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was reached in combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered .
a dos@@ ages recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , there is a eng@@ masch@@ ige guard recommended , since the efficacy and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
there has been no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but is recommended for at least one hour apart from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , with G@@ f@@ avi@@ r in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dosage is required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs would become low .
the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other protein @-@ previously and available limited data suggests that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r could possibly be sun@@ k .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advisable when Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din could be less effective because of the decreased and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma tiles .
if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is supposed to be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effects of combining am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and ser@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din difficult .
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin around 193 % and hence a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is required for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available .
pharmaceutical chem@@ ist studies with axi@@ om in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not done , however , the plasma of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to a increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on the 2.@@ 6@@ 9@@ ple compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole every day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ kled avi@@ r with k@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can , if they are applied together with map@@ le , possibly lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored with toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines if they are applied in combination with map@@ le .
based on the data from other prot@@ e@@ as@@ certain it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da is not taken at the same time as a@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to resi@@ dual effects .
the simultaneous use of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ si@@ va which are known as an enzyme phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of the plas@@ met@@ asp@@ ie@@ gel of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ concentrations , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ uted pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ ax@@ di@@ pin , and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
the simultaneous stop with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plas@@ tic@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Glu@@ k@@ ok@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , unless that the potential benefits of a treatment weighs a risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ esis ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors like Lov@@ ast@@ atin and sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , have pronounced cre@@ ases of plasma swe@@ ar at simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plastic m@@ asp@@ ie@@ ves increased these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabil@@ ise the mirror , since the plasma concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased by simultaneous ma@@ ker@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with an un@@ bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time used by A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ po@@ ep@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma @-@ grain from Mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am to the 3@@ - to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ on is administered together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ i@@ tion@@ ed symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
due to the low reliability of historic comparisons , there is currently no recommendation to be given , like the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to adjust if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation or reinfor@@ cement of the anti @-@ thro@@ wa@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not fores@@ ee@@ able so as alternative methods are recommended to contrac@@ eption .
metic@@ ulous monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side @-@ effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us .
in the milk l@@ actic rats , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r on people are over into the mother &apos;s milk .
a re@@ production study of toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the tear in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight in the after@@ math .
the further development of the offspring including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not com@@ promised by the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the un@@ certainties of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the effects associated with the a@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly to moderate , occurred early on and led rarely to the treatment break .
many of these events is not clear whether or not they are used in connection with the treatment of a@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of under@@ age .
most of the side @-@ mentioned side @-@ effects stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms not received patients 1200 mg of gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , seen by the examination , compared to the study medication , and with more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed .
the anti@@ retro@@ viral medication therapy has been associated with an re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peri@@ pher@@ als and fast under@@ skin tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and thor@@ ax fat tissues ( embro@@ i@@ rous of fat ) .
in 113 @-@ retrospective persons , who had been treated with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ din / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine over a middle duration of 36 weeks , was only observed a case ( pins ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 2@@ 45 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) at 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is for a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ly or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ly nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ iness and were usually performed during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ spec@@ ulating .
cases of oste@@ on@@ cology have been reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) .
at the time the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
with PI @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg of gener@@ ase twice daily , together with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r ( grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 to 4 ) and CP@@ D values , which were conducted among patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase , together with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r , very often occurred .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is based on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) when required , necessary supportive policies are required .
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ esters and thereby prevents the proc@@ ess@@ ation viral and G@@ AG @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ prot@@ ein@@ ation levels with the result of an formation of non @-@ infectious virus particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected with lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as at the peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ m in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ m in chronic cells
the connection between the activity of rec@@ ir@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ fit patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages were - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r geb@@ oo@@ st@@ oo@@ st@@ ules - the mut@@ ations described in mut@@ ations rarely observed .

a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ log@@ ic failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms not out@@ treated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of Res@@ ults testing .
on Phen@@ otyp@@ ical summary analyses Clinical phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for assessment of the activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .

each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain crus@@ hing resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensi@@ tiveness against In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general preserved .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance assistance between Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r Res@@ ults , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ fit patients , with which a Fos@@ am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ eb@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ z@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ eb@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ z@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
vice versa , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ prot@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early release of an abandoned therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which may impact on the following treatment .
the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ log@@ istic failure ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest acc@@ ol@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
one hundred and thre@@ e@@ fold ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to map@@ le , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included into the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ embarrassment of AP@@ V / k@@ avi@@ r in relation to the time @-@ adequate average interval of the raw value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , at a non @-@ sub@@ li@@ th@@ threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the effectiveness of un@@ brid@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies involving 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , a@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereas the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 RNA concentration , &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during therapy optimization with PI @-@ treated children of the benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for c@@ max at about 30 % cut when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) together with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered .
the administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of pat@@ ter@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of resi@@ ding .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ checked penetration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation to the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease of the total concentration of the active ingredient in plasma , with the amount of un@@ connected am@@ spec@@ kled , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ spec@@ ulating constant remains unchanged , the percentage of free active component during the stand@@ ardis@@ ation interval at the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bited or inhi@@ bited a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily dose @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not re@@ plac@@ eable on a milli@@ grams base .
also the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney @-@ disorder is likely to be small on the elimination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r @-@ Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ie@@ ves comparable to those who are obtained at healthy pro@@ pi@@ ds after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
in long @-@ term studies on the Kan@@ zer@@ ogen@@ r on mice and rats appeared with male animals en@@ ig@@ o@@ cellular aden@@ ome in doses that spoke to the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3.6 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to man , after twice daily use of 1200 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ cellular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure to human subjects , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , there were little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ tion tests , the bacterial nuts test test , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test , included in human peri@@ pher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ine@@ ties nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver deto@@ xi@@ ity can be controlled and proven in clinical everyday life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate .
previously , clinical trials have not yet been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in control as well as with the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
with a systemic sculpture , which lay statisti@@ cally below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeu@@ tical dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicates a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying add of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster@@ y ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ spec@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is designed in patients with relap@@ sed or mild liver @-@ disorder with caution , in patients with severe liver @-@ compul@@ sive disorder it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Rati@@ o ) , are available methods for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be cancelled on duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cos@@ as are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an elevated risk to a li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependence factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in was a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a settlement development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for c@@ max at about 30 % lower if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered .
the C@@ min values by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which was reached in combination of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg of k@@ avi@@ r twice daily is administered .
a dos@@ ages recommended for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , there is a eng@@ masch@@ ige guard recommended , since the efficacy and in@@ consistency of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ signs would become low .
if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is supposed to be made , as an exact pre@@ diction of the effects of combining am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and ser@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din difficult .
if it is required for clinical reasons to ad@@ minister ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 advised , although there are no clinical data available .
the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ concentrations like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ ax@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r , thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine .
in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % reduction interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation or reinfor@@ cement of the anti @-@ thro@@ wa@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.7 mg Nor@@ eth@@ ind@@ ron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r around 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
this medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a re@@ production study of toler@@ able rats , which was administered by the tear in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a diminished increase in the weight of the body weight .
the un@@ certainties of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose the patient is based on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) when required , necessary supportive policies are required .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected with lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , C@@ em @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peri@@ pher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % black@@ con@@ centric ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ m in acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ m in chronic cells ( 1 µ@@ m = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
vice versa , Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ prot@@ mer @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data should be considered in the therapy optimization in with PI @-@ treated children , which should be considered an anticipated benefit from &quot; un@@ brid@@ led &quot; e@@ gener@@ ase .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ connected am@@ spec@@ ulating constant remains , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active component during the stand@@ ardis@@ ation interval at the Ste@@ ady State on the range of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bited or inhi@@ bited a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution , if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .

the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the he@@ pat@@ o@@ cel@@ tic aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma has not yet been solved yet and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure to human subjects , both from clinical trials and the therapeutic application , however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings are made .

studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in control as well as with the Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r .
these results can be concluded that in juven@@ iles the met@@ metabolic passages are not yet fully mature , so Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r or other critical constitu@@ ents of the formulation ( z .

the benefit of with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for entry has not been occupied with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take is around 14 % lower than from Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to arrive on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram was not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules by taking the solution to stop ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medication up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , there must be no dosage recommendations for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to inser@@ tion and low @-@ down k@@ avi@@ r avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patients is avoided .
although a dose @-@ adjustment for am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r is not required for necessary , is an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to arrive in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ts is an A@@ gener@@ ase solution for getting older children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver suffer@@ ings and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the met@@ abol@@ isation of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with map@@ le does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination .

the application sti@@ ff@@ ness and duration of treatment with al@@ dara depend on the disease @-@ treated illness : • At F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks three times a week . • In case of small bas@@ al ker@@ at@@ ants , it is during one or two @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks of pause between the treatment cycles , times weekly .
the cream is in front of bed@@ time th@@ ein@@ ous to the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin , before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area 16 weeks .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete pick@@ up of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined on 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and al@@ dara or placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete reco@@ vering of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ os .
in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete waste @-@ healing rate was collected in all four main studies , but only 3 % up to 18 % compared with placebo patients . • The results of the two studies showed up to 80 % compared to 0 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .

in other studies where no daily pre @-@ inflammatory drugs have been performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mos@@ is and one case with a circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ pper were observed .
in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation have also been observed , which caused a treatment and / or have led to a temporary impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which required an emergency the@@ ter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area .
to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous means to treat extreme F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital area of genital war@@ eness , there have so far been no clinical experience .

the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ arms and hands do not support the effectiveness in this purpose of application , therefore such application is not recommended .
local door@@ step actions often occur , but these reactions usually take in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if local domestic reactions to the patient cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for some days .
from the data of an open clinical study indicate that patients with more than 8 ac@@ les@@ ions showed a lesser complete healing rate than patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions .
because of the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) .

the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will get patients who receive the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to distribute authorisation from Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mammals ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ er@@ stock of Chinese Ham@@ sters ) .

treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place through a doctor , the experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial In@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients can not be recommended as a automation scheme .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure , has not been determined , and for these patients can not be recommended as a substitute scheme .
with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ conditioned reactions that are defined as any associated side @-@ effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the intra@@ day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
this is why specifically these patients should continue to be eng@@ masch@@ ige for this reason , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be done in an appropriate clinical environment , in the re@@ vit@@ alisation process for medical emergen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G @-@ antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment begins .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as little experience in dealing with the res@@ ump@@ tion of the treatment after a longer break , must be cautious due to the theoretical risk of hyper@@ sensitive reaction after a break of the treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion using medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti @-@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of an easy or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion response , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ os@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be wei@@ ghed and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion response , the in@@ fusion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are brought to decrease , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be re @-@ added with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate where the reaction has occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular reception of larv@@ ae .
animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirect detri@@ mental effects on pregnancy , the embryonic development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ ale development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exp@@ elled from Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase on the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms not to satisfy .
the side effects in clinical trials were primarily referred to as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that have been observed at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years of treatment ( duration of up to 1 year ) .
unwanted effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms that were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 and older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table below : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , serious reactions occurred , including bronze @-@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
children un@@ solic@@ ited pharmaceutical effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which was reported in a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
most patients came to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment , with a heavy exp@@ and@@ ular form during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) .
until the end of the phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients there were no det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say det@@ ectable antibodies , including 3 patients , in which it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with l@@ acked up to low testosterone levels led a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mir@@ rors in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibody ti@@ tres was a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ al up to low neutrality and effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which did not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug interactions , even though the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme .
according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and recorded cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ised , double blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were reported by the central phen@@ otype and only one patient proved the heavy phen@@ otype .
patients have been recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ ation@@ ic volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meter .
the primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ - sal@@ es@@ test test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were treated to enhancing the lung function and the capacity to be presented in the following table .
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage of the percentage is clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute volume of lung @-@ volumes raised to proportional to the body size of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a he@@ pat@@ ron@@ age in front of treatment 22 ( 85 % ) by the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was established until the end of the study remained constant .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease @-@ line between the patients , which has been taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes collap@@ sing for five efficacy approval , movement of the school joint ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
there was a one @-@ year open phase 2 study conducted in which al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were examined by twenty patients who were at the time of their recording in the study of 5 years ( 16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the middle form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the har@@ n in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) and all 4 patients with the average exp@@ ir@@ ation form reported a normal mental development speed , whereas in the elderly patients with severe exp@@ and@@ ular form had limited only limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a Phase 4 study investigations have been carried out to pharmac@@ o@@ genic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ do@@ automation schem@@ ata at the G@@ AG levels in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of this two do@@ automation schem@@ ata is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to that in older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a other drug against cancer ) , which is still not removed from chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( vi@@ cious - cancer ) , and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( vi@@ cious or metastatic ) non @-@ single &quot; lung cancer that is not attacks the turn@@ around cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ en than any therapy .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin C ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tic &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side @-@ effects occur , the treatment should be swal@@ lowed up , or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ frac@@ tures s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of mal@@ ignant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had never received any chemotherapy against their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which had previously been treated with chemotherapy ( doc@@ et@@ axel ) with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( a further medicine for cancer ) and both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously had received chemotherapy previously , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ axel .
however , in both studies , patients , in which cancer did not attack the turn@@ around cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival , than with the compar@@ atively drug .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company El@@ i Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to grant permission for transpor@@ ting A@@ lim@@ ta in the European Union .
each di@@ ste@@ ep@@ le bottle has to be solved with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % Nat@@ ri@@ p@@ chlori@@ de injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the appropriate volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from the break@@ water bottle and is dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % Nat@@ ri@@ di@@ chlori@@ de injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml . ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mono@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ ad@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² ( KO@@ F ) administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ pipe @-@ in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
reduction in incidence and sever@@ ity of home actions must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ pipe dose .
patients must also receive an in@@ tra @-@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after every third conversion cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created prior to any gift a complete blood image - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ lic census .
the al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place under res@@ cent of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ in of the forec@@ ast@@ ed therapeutic cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ rit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ atology Tox@@ ic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient gets the value in front of the treatment
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken when in patients following 2 dos@@ is@@ reduc@@ tive Tox@@ ic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological Tox@@ ic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continue with the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above in comparison to patients at the age of 65 is an increased risk @-@ effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data on uncertainty and effectiveness .
in clinical studies , in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no tin adap@@ ts necessary , which go beyond the recommended Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function regul@@ ators of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - border value and / or trans@@ ac@@ as@@ en@@ value of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 points of the upper limit value ( at the presence of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver enhancement ) is not specifically examined in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the button mark@@ er and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic number restored a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thy@@ dial number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic number , Th@@ ro@@ ar number and maxim@@ ally non @-@ hem@@ atology as they have been observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ le@@ ak toxicity such as neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , feb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was pu@@ ffed if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 has taken place .
therefore , all patients need to be reli@@ ed with relap@@ sed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as prophy@@ l@@ actic measure to reduction treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous taking non @-@ epilep@@ tic anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ali@@ - cy@@ @-@ acid ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients , for which treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ated is intended to avoid the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time duration for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients where these events arose , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or Diabetes .
therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant liquid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular room a drainage of the ergometer can be wei@@ ghed before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ ids , and cr@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasions when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason the simultaneous application @-@ filled life di@@ aphr@@ ag@@ m ( excluding yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of an irrever@@ sible skull must be trac@@ ed by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be cau@@ tioned in front of the treatment - should be advised to consult with respect to sperm production .
in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) you can manage high doses of non@@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ oxid@@ ation ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased sequ@@ encing with the result of a multip@@ lication of side @-@ effects .
therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine acid can be applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and mind@@ set - T@@ ens 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since no data is available with regard to interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time such as pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards rati@@ os ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women , but just like an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ est@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be severe in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily re@@ flexi@@ bly and after careful consideration of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
since the possibility of irrever@@ sible damage of reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment beginning to obtain consultation regarding the sperm block@@ age .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk goes over and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of unwanted effects which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om and the random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed Er@@ - held as well as 163 patients with Mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , which received random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the drug medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the mal@@ ignant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ om , was shown in the application of Lun@@ enburg @-@ cancer sc@@ ala arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ placed tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms were produced by improving the pul@@ mon@@ ing parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment of lung function during the time in the control panel .
a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III study with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy regim@@ en an medi@@ an over@@ time period of 8,@@ 3 months treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA @-@ treated patients ( intent to Tre@@ at Pop@@ ulation n = 2@@ 83 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel patients ( IT@@ T n = 2@@ 88 ) .

if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they may not disman@@ tle some fats in the food , causing a quarter of the fats which are led with the food inf@@ ects the intest@@ ine .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients had joined the All@@ i 60 mg after one year @-@ average weight loss of 4,@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no one could be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss .

alli is used for weight loss of adults with excessive weight ( Body Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fet@@ ched diet .
alli must not be applied by children and young people under 18 , since not enough data on efficacy and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at however only has to be absorbed only minimal , in elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adaptation of the dosage is necessary .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the substance or any of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.@@ 6 ) • Chron@@ icle ( see Section 4.@@ 6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if it is taken together with a low @-@ fat glass or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control , patients who consult a drug against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic may need to be adjusted .
patients , the alli , as well as medicines for high blood pressure , or increased cholesterol levels , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adjusted .
it is recommended to meet additional wa@@ vering measures to prevent additional failure of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on interactions of medicines and in several cases , with the current use of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ plasma organ was observed .
in use of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ alen anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values could be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .

however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time to assume a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitamin D ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
after the gift of a one @-@ mal@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of volunteers were given at the same time , a slight decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric .
animal experim@@ entation showed no direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of the organ are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ases is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with a list of 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
the frequencies are as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( excluding 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence on the basis of available data is not estim@@ able ) .
the frequency of the known side @-@ effects that were noted after the launch of the organ , is unknown because these events voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size .
† Es is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli can lead to spra@@ ying with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .

clinical trials has been derived , that 60 mg of organs , taken three times a day , absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ ts blocked .
two double blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ e@@ controlled trials to adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg organs , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , o@@ vers@@ ed diet .
the primary parameters , the modification of the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of the Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those study participants lost over 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies the weight reduction over 12 months has been observed , the largest weight loss occurred in the first six months .

the most common side @-@ effects hang together with the functioning of the capsules , and thus arise that increasing fat from the body is eliminated .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of the treatment of treatment as you may have not reduced fat content in your diet at that time .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the food @-@ related companion application : • Beg@@ ins you already couple of days , or better a week before taking the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ ched diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite dish and over the size of the portions that you normally take .

Alo@@ xi is used with chemotherapy regim@@ en , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chemotherapy , an excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi may be increased by the extra gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine which can be used as anti@@ fung@@ al ) .
the use in patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , since the effects in this age group does not have enough information .
this means that the active ingredient is prevents the attachment of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adult studies , which received chemotherapy and vom@@ iting for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are 59 % of patients treated with al@@ alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 126 of 221 ) .
in chemotherapy , the excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , showed 81 % of the patients treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 15@@ 3 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s patients ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 , the European Commission granted the company in Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. for approval by Alo@@ xi in the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute symptoms and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer treatment and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the efficacy of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
since Pal@@ on@@ osis can extend the col@@ on age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty ob@@ struction or signs of a substantial I@@ le@@ us after the injection of eng@@ masch@@ ige .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised at simultaneous closure of Pal@@ on@@ osis with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ osis , the targeted activity of the five analysed chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) .
in a clinical trial there showed no significant pharmac@@ o@@ cular interaction between a sing@@ ular dose of Pal@@ on@@ osis and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , one C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
in a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ cul@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , Sem@@ i@@ ti@@ din , R@@ ini@@ dine , Ran@@ i@@ ti@@ din , ser@@ tr@@ al@@ in and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ osis .
experiences regarding the use of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in human pregn@@ ancies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is considered to be considered by the treating doctor .
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observe side @-@ effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) that were at least possibly with alo@@ xi in the context , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ struction ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive actions and reactions to the administration of the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of undes@@ irable events have shown themselves like in the other do@@ cking groups ; there were no dose of drugs to watch .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been performed , however , due to the large number of distribution , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy with a Alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7.1 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7.1 hours ) , which was given every day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ ason IV .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ thes , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which were given every day 1 intraven@@ ously .
results of studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies to indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ osis agents were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and E@@ KG parameters including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls , including the relevant effects from On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ osis has the ability to block the iter@@ acy channels involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ polar@@ isation of the iter@@ acy channels and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy research was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ V. administered Pal@@ on@@ osis in single d@@ ots of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg .
Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous G@@ abe follows an initi@@ alization of plas@@ tic@@ con@@ centric , a slow elimination of the body with an average season @-@ time duration of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
according to intraven@@ ous G@@ abe of Pal@@ on@@ osis , 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase from the 1 and day 5 common ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ osis @-@ plas@@ tic@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % .
from pharmac@@ o@@ cular sim@@ ulations , it emerged that at once daily intraven@@ ous G@@ abe were comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg measured . however , the C@@ max is higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher .
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys , and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ osis , above less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or .
in @-@ vit@@ ro studies to met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the iso@@ o@@ C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 is involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ osis .
elimination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron were found about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ osis . made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a sing@@ ular form of intraven@@ ous , in 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver @-@ disorder the termin@@ ale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ osis is increased , however , a reduction in the dose is however not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have been observed only after ex@@ positions which are regarded as sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance to the clinical use .
10 from prec@@ lin@@ ical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ osis is only blocking in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and can prolong the shareholders of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ osis ( each dose posted in about 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ ly incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , pitu@@ itary gland ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not on mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since alo@@ xi when humans are destined for the unique application , the relevance of these results will be low for humans .
the owner of this permit for inspection has to inform the European Commission about plans for marketing purposes within the framework of this decision @-@ approved drug .

June 2006 , the Committee on Human@@ pharmac@@ eu@@ pon ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report , in which the approval of the approval for the approval of the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C medication by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection resolution .
this means that al@@ he@@ on a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should be similar to the same v@@ asi@@ an effective component already approved in the EU ( also &quot; Re@@ ference phar@@ ma &quot; ) .
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ prolonged ) hepatitis C ( one caused by viral infection ) .
when a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination shows the liver tissue damage , moreover , the values of the liver @-@ enz@@ ym@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters ( AL@@ T ) increased in the blood standard .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was brought to the formation of the active ingredient .
the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on presented data that cover the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance , composition and purity of the drug , action , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of the Alp@@ he@@ on &apos;s efficacy was compared to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment were reported on the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

furthermore , concerns have been expressed , that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and of the drug drug .
the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on the illness fl@@ amm@@ ated more patients with more patients than with the reference practitioner ; in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects .
aside from this , the test used in the study was analysed how far the drug is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficient vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation and small in@@ infected species of skin infection ) and small in@@ infected species ( cr@@ acking or cutting ) , de@@ preci@@ ation and paraly@@ zed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections , det@@ ectable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this type of infections may not work .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients aged 9 months from the age of nine , but in patients under the age of 18 must not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works through block@@ ade of bacterial warfare ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , where proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indication of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was sealed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected Hau@@ ts , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar rating : if the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ ts , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment .
in these two studies , however , has been found that Al@@ tar@@ go is caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( van@@ ised cavity ) or infections that were det@@ ectable or probably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the order .
the Committee on Human@@ pharmac@@ eu@@ pon ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections are ou@@ twei@@ gh the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ peti@@ tions , stri@@ ps or paraly@@ sed wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd received an approval for the marketing of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients , in which no improvement shows within two or three days , should be examined once more and be considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
in the case of raising or severe local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , treatment broke down , the anoin@@ ting carefully wi@@ ped carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
clinical trials in secondary studies were the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment there is no improvement or a deterioration of the infected place .
the effect of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the small plasma concentration , which have been achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant sub@@ fr@@ aming in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical skin of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ity Sal@@ be on sh@@ opped skin from healthy adult men around 81 % .
due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not considered necessary if topical re@@ trac@@ ts are applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproduction of production according to oral intake and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and f@@ owl / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clear and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin of the gift of a systemic antibiotic treatment is prefer@@ able .
when deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / ended , between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman are considering .
in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go has been applied , the most commonly reported side effect irritation during the date , which regarded approximately 1 % of patients .

the effect mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by inter@@ acting on a particular bond @-@ unit of the bacterial reef , which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bind@@ ing position of the Bosnian protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ centre .
by loyalty to this connection point inhi@@ bit Ple@@ uro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ Transfer , blocking partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ous sub@@ units .
should be due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin on at least some infection forms , a consultation through experts should be as@@ certain@@ ed .
there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ aur@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ate was sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin .
in the case of failure to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ dine ) should be considered .

ambi@@ rix is applied to protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
ambi@@ rix is applied within two doses of existing vaccination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vacc@@ inations of two doses can lead to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine will be given .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease .
once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it .
ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and since 1997 approved vaccination Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases but are administered Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children as part of an existing vaccination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as a test@@ ament to the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a protective antibody in the last injection .
in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six months and a 12 months gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix led us between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had a six @-@ hour gap between the injections and a 12 @-@ month gap between the injections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain an the inj@@ ecting site , redness , matri@@ ces ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may respond to patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) are not used .
August 2002 , the European Commission issued the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for transpor@@ ting Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization of Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a refres@@ her age is needed for Hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ ulation vaccines or with a combination @-@ simple vaccine .
the anti @-@ oxid@@ ant anti @-@ hepatitis viruses ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same scale as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines .
it is not yet completely secured , if immun@@ o @-@ competent persons identified on a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , a refres@@ her age can be protected as protection as they are also protected by no more det@@ ectable antibodies as immun@@ ological memory .
3 As with all inj@@ uri@@ ous ingredients , for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , the relevant ways of medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation scheme is recommended , the 360 ELISA units form@@ able Hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface .
in the patient @-@ patient and persons with disorders of the immune system , according to the basis of the basis , no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibody is achieved , so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the glut@@ eal muscle for an optimal imp@@ eller success , these injections should be avoided .
however , with Th@@ ro@@ genic cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ eff@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift .
when Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life in the form of a separate inj@@ ector , t@@ et@@ us@@ ul@@ ä@@ c , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influenza type b vaccine administered ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine administered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens sufficiently ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective needs to be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study , which was carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the incidence , which was observed in the earlier Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine .
in clinical trials 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered in a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of ambi@@ rix had compared with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and skill at a calculation basis per vaccination ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % at the Pro@@ bank after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
after the complete vaccination reported 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the commission , the Ambi@@ rix had received , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.6 % with the subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - Com@@ bin@@ ational simp@@ lex .
however , the incidence of mat@@ ernity was comparable to high ( that is , over the whole vaccine at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den that received Ambi@@ rix , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % at the Pro@@ ban@@ den that received the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant .
the incidence affected by pain and mat@@ ernity was low and comparable to that after administration of the com@@ bin@@ ational simp@@ lex that was observed with the 3 @-@ c@@ anned vaccine .
in a comparative study in 1@@ - up to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable with that , which was observed with the 3 @-@ doses combin@@ ant simple with 360 ELISA @-@ units de@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with ambi@@ rix had been a common occurrence of pain ( on the inj@@ ecting site ) per dose , not pro @-@ tape , reports .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported via severe side @-@ effects during the 2 @-@ layer vacc@@ inations with ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vaccine adjuv@@ ant with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface , was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials that were carried out at vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ tible rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.3 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses received ambi@@ rix and 147 the default combin@@ ant with three doses .
with the 2@@ 89 people whose immuno@@ ass@@ eness was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ er rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after G@@ abe of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ im@@ pf@@ d are significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune response that in a clinical comparison study by 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds have been reached a month after the complete vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ layer vacc@@ inations with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA @-@ units de@@ activated H@@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface .
for individuals who were at the time of the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation between 12 and 15 years old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune response reaction against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 doses of a combination simp@@ atic , consisting of 360 ELISA units de@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface is detected in a c@@ anned volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - up to 15 @-@ year @-@ old , the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccination scheme is compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .

a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation similar ser@@ op@@ r@@ ote@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ pen@@ de to any other foreign articles and / or physically visible changes to be examined .

the Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as bathing in through water @-@ waters contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired have a dark urine , a bl@@ ending face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( Yellow @-@ looking ) and other symptoms that may possibly be a stationary treatment .
as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not be completely protected from an infection with hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you are infected / Your Child in front of the administration of both Lyme disease or Hepatitis B virus , is ( although you / your child can not feel uncomfortable or sick ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those following a Hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be conve@@ yed .
• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through ju@@ ck@@ ery r@@ ashes , air@@ pressure or swelling of the face or the tongue . • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a serious infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a patient protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the filing of the second vaccination dose ) .
with a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a formal Hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content to effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vacc@@ inations .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from those who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you have weak@@ ened / your child due to a disorder or treatment in your body &apos;s body , or if you / your child undergo a tick @-@ move .
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of those individuals on the vaccine cannot be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how much the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Sa@@ w your doctor if you / your child taking additional medicines / adop@@ ts ( including those who have been given without prescription ) or if you / her child was recently vacc@@ inated / was administered or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) , or has been planned in the near future .
but it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible as possible .
if ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be adequate .
usually , Ambi@@ rix or nursing women are not administered unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about specific other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
a very common ( more than 1 case per 10 tri@@ mm@@ ed doses ) : • pain or discomfort in the tear or redness • matri@@ mon@@ ability • head@@ ache • Ap@@ peti@@ tiveness .
( up to 1 case per 10 tri@@ mm@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the inj@@ ecting site • fever ( more than 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ om@@ men@@ ities • gastro@@ intestinal symptoms
further side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single substances against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 used doses ) are :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has been known since issu@@ ance of the first permit for inspection , the CH@@ MP came that the value @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ rix stays positive .
however its ambi@@ rix had only been placed in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete end@@ z@@ ym@@ ective or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ em@@ o@@ encephal@@ opathy ( brain damage , as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ium concentration ) in the pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - divided into several sol@@ vent to meals - swal@@ lowed up among the food or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) administered .
it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ k could not be compared with any other treatment or with placebo ( a placebo drug that is to be compared with no substance ) .
am@@ mon@@ aps can also result in loss loss , a decrease in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches or taste , abdom@@ inal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ ds in patients with mal@@ functions of the ur@@ inary cycle has to prevent high am@@ moni@@ ous values effectively .
Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved in &quot; extraordinary circumstances , since due to the r@@ arity of the disease , there were only limited information on this medicine at the time of approval .
the use is inde@@ xed to all patients where a complete endor@@ ous lack is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ ective defect , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first life of life ) , there is an indication for use when in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ary encephal@@ opathy consists .
for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with slip disorders , AM@@ MONA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form .
the daily dose is individually calculated by taking up the patient intolerance and the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium poly@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ app@@ ucc@@ in@@ ase deficiency need ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with lo@@ op@@ sy , as there is a risk to the emergence of eyel@@ ash ho@@ op if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MONA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ y@@ rian , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium in@@ suffici@@ ency and estrogen levels .
since met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium poly@@ ureth@@ ral about the liver and the kidneys take place , AM@@ MONA@@ PS in patients with liver or kidney failure should only be applied with extreme caution .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous r@@ abe of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of crum@@ bling syn@@ ap@@ ses and a diminished number of functioning neur@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in humans into the mother &apos;s milk , and for that reason the use of AM@@ MONA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MONA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients stood at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) to and at 78 % of those undes@@ irable events that they were not associated with AM@@ MONA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old hero@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose appeared at a 5 month old small child with a lon@@ ged single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , shown at a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ unlimited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound connected by acet@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ amine that is eliminated by the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etr@@ ically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced .
it is important that the diagnosis is placed at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical result .
the prognosis of the early mani@@ ac form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the new @-@ born age was earlier almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ckers @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by ho@@ ur@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ ric ex@@ cre@@ ase ( sodium and sodium acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ben@@ zo@@ at and Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ ben@@ zene and sodium amino acids , it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of newborn in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first lifetime ) of diagnosed disorders to 80 % .
in patients whose disease has been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it came with the time of many too mental disabilities or other neurological deficits .
in patients with a late mani@@ ac form of the disease ( including soft patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ oten form of or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase defect ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ y encephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium and prot@@ rac@@ ted diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed in liver and Ni@@ ere enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine con@@ ju@@ ly , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , of hem@@ ost@@ asis and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous m@@ atism from sodium poly@@ y@@ rian ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after in@@ gesting measurable plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cells or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ y@@ opath@@ ies ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was veri@@ fiable in the next morning .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis that were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single cells ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ at@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations in the plasma @-@ wind @-@ organ were scored on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts .
the drug is eliminated within 24 hours approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine on the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ at was treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic effects ( study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low no tablets or patients with lo@@ op@@ sy ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al son@@ de .
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium poly@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be held within the normal range .
in patients suffering from an early mani@@ ac lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans@@ car@@ b@@ yl@@ ase , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MONA@@ PS gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium poly@@ y@@ rian , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rats were exposed before the birth phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain @-@ cows .
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MONA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old hero@@ ic patient who developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tose , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peri@@ pher@@ al neuro@@ pa@@ thy and pancre@@ atitis .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etr@@ ically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced .
already existing neurological deficits are also hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ y@@ but@@ y@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form 15 minutes after in@@ gesting measurable plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
during the duration of durability , the patient can save the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measurement of the 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ t@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ at .
if a patient has to get the medication about a probe , AM@@ MONA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium poly@@ y@@ rian is up to 5 g in 10 ml water ) .
in people with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they can not be able to withdraw from proteins in the body after consumption of proteins .
if you are done with laboratory studies , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MONA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies .

angi@@ ox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute car@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dium ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) .
becomes angi@@ ox for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients applied to a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help with patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack for the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients attended the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ some gift , or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ ic inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different drug to prevent cl@@ ots with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
during the PCI , the patient frequently became a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a loss ) , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , heart attacks or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year altogether as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who subjected to a PCI , angi@@ ox in regards to all indicators just as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except in heavy blood pressure , in which it was considerably more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other hir@@ u@@ dine , or any of the other components .
it should also not be applied in patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or a reduction problem .
the Human@@ ity Committee ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Angi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a remov@@ able replacement for he@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd received an approval for the marketing of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ verage ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in an emergency and if an early intervention is planned .
the recommended Initi@@ als dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting of 0,@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
in the case with the patient a PCI is carried out , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be raised and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dosage can be recorded by 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg is administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ o@@ xes in patients with a PCI is made up of a initi@@ al intraven@@ ous form of 0,@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value is shortened by 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight , this value should be shortened by 0,@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and th@@ inner medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis quickly failed intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney type ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , a lower inflation rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h .
if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is to be held from 0,@@ 3 mg / kg and re@@ confirm the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which was included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which was included in the approval , the ACT was worth 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ adjustable on average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 in patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox @-@ contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be taken 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous issue of lower molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to substance or any other components or against brain @-@ risk • active bleeding or increased blood @-@ risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irrever@@ sible hyper@@ tension . • severe un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able hyper@@ tension and sub@@ atomic bacterial cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine occur most of the bleeding most arter@@ ial pun@@ ches , in patients , who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ tery ( PCI ) while the treatment principle occur anywhere .
in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , should consider a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Standards rati@@ os ) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din was once again achieved the level of treatment .
depar@@ ting from the knowledge of the effect mechanism of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ ten@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these substances raise the bleeding danger .
in the combination of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mern or anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological here@@ of parameters to control in any case regularly .
the experimental examinations are inadequate in terms of pregnancy , the embryo / fet@@ al development , the removal or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) .

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in those with he@@ par@@ in @-@ treated comparative groups , women and patients over 65 are more common to undes@@ irable events as in male or younger patients .
heavy blood measurements were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and T@@ IM@@ I scales for heavy bleeding , as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and serious bleeding occurred at Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone significantly less often than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ tive , in@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ o@@ cular blood cells or bleeding in the pun@@ ctu@@ ation point , reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ al levels of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood @-@ level , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .

the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients , which subjected to a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group and in those with he@@ par@@ in @-@ treated comparative groups , women and patients over 65 were more common to undes@@ irable events as in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred at Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significantly less often than in the comparative @-@ group on He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
following side effects which are not listed above have been reported after extensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs ordered in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dose the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will immediately break down and the patient eng@@ masch@@ ige with regard to signs of bleeding .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , young people and children over six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a permanent in@@ fusion with a insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce sufficient insulin in regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in blood or that insulin is not used effectively .
insulin is very neg@@ li@@ gible to humanity , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter work time than a short @-@ effective human@@ ist .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indication for the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study of adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.2 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin per year .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % at human normal level .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients who may possibly be super@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components , or in patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to distribute A@@ pi@@ dra to the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra is referred to as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the part of the stomach @-@ blan@@ ket or the del@@ usion or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal box .
due to the decreased glucose capacity and diminished insulin pump , insulin can be dem@@ oted in patients with a limitation of liver function .
any change of the active force , the mark ( origin ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand .
3 A insufficient dosage or the demo@@ lition of treatment , especially in patients with an ins@@ ulator medication , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and an diabe@@ tic cl@@ eto@@ azi@@ ti@@ ary ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening .
changing one patient to another insulin or insulin is required to take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in switching the treatment schem@@ as .

serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ bodies with consci@@ in@@ som@@ nia can be treated by in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 @-@ 1 mg ) , treated by a given person , or treated by a doctor of glucose by a doctor .
according to a glucose inj@@ ecting , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine or cause of the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peri@@ pher@@ al glucose intake ( especially by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ ters cro@@ u@@ be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the time duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ly normal .
in a study involving 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 @-@ diabetes mel@@ low insulin pump showed 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg a dis@@ proportionate increase in glu@@ ing glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase of glu@@ ing effect , just like Human@@ ism .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has an twice as fast activity as a normal human impact and achie@@ ves the complete glu@@ ing effect of about 2 hours earlier than Human@@ ity .
from the data it was clear that in an application of insulin lo@@ ul@@ is@@ within 2 minutes before the meal a comparable ic gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as is made with human subjects , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
was insulin lo@@ b@@ ulation in 2 minutes before the meal , has been achieved a better , efficient control than with human subjects , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
insulin is used in 15 minutes after the meal commen@@ ced at the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human standard , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin insulin at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human standard , which was given 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) , as well as compared to human standard , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
