<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European public Publication report (EPAR), which explains how the studies conducted for Humanity (CHMP), in order to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need further information about your illness or treatment, please read the packet (also component of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, than 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to decrease (1 mg / ml) and as an injection resolution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. poised thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing of things that are not present), distrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental disease, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal alright) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Bilify is used to treat moderate to severe malonic episodes and the prevention of disaster in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection resolution is applied to fast control of increased anxiety or behavioral disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">With both diseases, the solution can be applied to submitting or melt-coated tablets in patients making the slip of tablets difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="9">Patients "" "" "" suffering from patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines that are just as bilify should be adapted to the dose of bilify. "" "</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects the signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably works mainly as a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters effect to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, Aripiprazole carries in to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and their re-act is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of bilify, the re-emergence of symptoms, was examined in three studies through up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting triggers was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared to increased agitation, over a period of two hours using a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify has been compared twelve weeks to 347 patients with semi-operating dol, in another study the efficacy of bilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients where the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of bilify injection solution was made in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered in increased restlessness, with which of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">For all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined by a standard scala disorder or the number of patients who spoke to treatment outcomes.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body resorbed to the melting tablets and the solution to the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two studies with the injecting solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients received a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the application of the treatment of bipolar disorder diminished Abilify in four of the five short-time studies manic symptoms are more effective than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re-emergence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients), extramarisk (uncontroleness), sedation (hardness), nautical secretion (increased saliva), fatigue and fatigue, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The committee for humanitarian aid (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of bilify in treating schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in those the manic episodes of the treatment with Aripiprazole said to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee also came to the result that the benefits of injection resolution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioral disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not appropriate to outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for approval by Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is prescribed for treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes to treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of the meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initials should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole-dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suction behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, there was no increased risk of sufficiency with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardium), cerebral vascular diseases, conditions that are used for Hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood-pressurised medicines) or hypertension (including accelidered and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials, which was a year or less lasting, there were occasional reports during treatment with Aripiprazol ascending dyskinesia.</seg>
<seg id="39">If in a case with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a late dyll should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic drugs must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used in cases with severe cases in anamnese or with accidents, which are associated with severe cases with caution.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, an elevated mortality rate compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relation between the dosage and the response for unwanted rovascular events treated with Aripiprazl-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoaziy or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-specific undesirable events treated with ABILIFY and other atypical antipsychotic drugs, the direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyurethral and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a deterioration in glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Gaining weight gain is generally with schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mantis, the use of antipsychotic drugs, where weight gain is known as a side-effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effectual drugs called sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the Resorptionsrate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is however not relevant as clinically.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers increased a high-effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidine) the AUC by Aripiprazl around 107%, while the Cmax left unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine-tin, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="52">At CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor ") Metabolisier can result in the common use of high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metals.</seg>
<seg id="53">If you consider the common use of Ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV proteaseinhibitors, have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reductions.</seg>
<seg id="55">After drafting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of ABILIFY should be raised to the Dosage at the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 will be given together with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day have no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethylan / 3-methodology morphine), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Dextromethylan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify your doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data base on safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless its potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotic medicines, patients should be warned of dangerous machines, including power vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects are more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as potential medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The incidence of side-down side-effects is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks with patients treated with Aripiprazole, a total of lower incidence (25,8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathema and Dyskinesia compared to patients who were treated with semi-operated idol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS amounted to 19% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study on 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under oconzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in Bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS increased 23.5% in patients under Aripiprazolkin treatment and 53.3% in patients with semi-operated idol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients under Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term initial phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study the incidence of EPS amounted to 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazolkin treatment and 15.7% for placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the people's groups under Aripiprazol and placebo where potentially clinically significant changes in routinely controlled laboratory parameters, revealed not medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases the CPK (creatine phophobic kinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole-treated patients compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">To the side effects which can appear in connection with an antipsychotic therapy, and about their occurrence also was reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol, the malignant neuroleptic syndrome and increased mortality in elderly dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the launch of the launch, unintentional or intentional overdose were observed with Aripiprazole alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">While there is no information on the effectiveness of a tick-testing in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol; it is unlikely, however, that heredialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose, as Aripiprazol has high plasma-formation.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors is conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor and an excessive affinity to dopamine D4-, to serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrengen and to histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With Gift of Aripiprazole in dosages of 0.5-30 mg once daily for 2 weeks at healthy volunteers showed the Possibility-dependent reduction of attachment of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3-receptor ligands, on the Nucleus caudatus and on the coup.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-time studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Aripiprazole compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of psychotic symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a semi-operating dol-controlled study was in week 52 the proportion of the Responder patients showing a response to the study medication, in both groups similar (Aripiprazol 77% and Halab dol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary study programs, including PANSS and the Montgomery Azberg- Headquarters, showed a significant stronger improvement than with the semi-operating dol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction of the back rate indicated by 34% in the Aripiprazol group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In a stream-controlled, multinational double-blind study at Schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients occupied and in which the primary study potential 'weight gain' joined under Aripiprazl (N = 18 or 13% of the most valuable patient records) at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5,6 kg with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I-disorder showed Aripiprazole one opposite placebo superior effectiveness in reducing sperm symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled Monotherapy study on 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior effectiveness versus placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placeand active monotherapy studies for 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole showed a compared to placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a clue effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Haloperdol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazol also referred to 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the Manie on such as lithium or semi-operating dol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features which, in part over 2 weeks, did not respond to Lithium- or Valproach Monotherapy in therapeutic serum, yielded an superior effectiveness in reducing sperm symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or Valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study on 26 weeks followed by a long-term expansion phase over 74 weeks with manic patients suffering from marginalisation phase ahead of marginalisation, Aripiprazole showed up to placebo in terms of prevention of a bipolar backward case, predominantly in preventing a relapse in the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for stretching and hydroxych of Aripiprazole, the N-Dealkydy is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The average elimination period is about approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole with extensive metabolisies over CYP2D6 and at approximate 146 hours at 'bad' (= 'poor ") metabolisians over CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharma-disorder between male and female healthy volunteers, and showed no gender-dependent effects during a pharmacoinetic examination of schizophrenic patients.</seg>
<seg id="91">A-specific evaluation of pharmacoinetics revealed not an indication of clinically significant differences concerning the ethnic origin or the effect of the smoking on the pharmaceutical field of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacoinetic properties of Aripiprazol and dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study with Probanden with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function at the drug cozole and dehydro-Aripiprazol, but the study embraced only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on security, toxicity, toxicity, toxicity, and cancerogenic potential could be seen no particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological effects have only been observed in doses or expositions, which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited only limited or no meaning for the clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects embraced by a dose-dependent of kidney-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchyma loss (AUC) at the recommended Maximaldosis in humans) and an increase of renal stem from 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (AUC) at the recommended Maximalddose to humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the outbreak of sulphate syndicates of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated medical dose or the 16- to 81times the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the results found in the human Galle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found in the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole no more than 6% of the concentrations observed in the study of 39 weeks in the Galle by monkeys, and lie far under the threshold values (6%) of vitro-soliteness.</seg>
<seg id="99">At rabbits these effects were observed according to dosages which led to expositions of the 3- and 11s of the middle Steady-State AUC at the recommended clinical Maximalddose.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimikrotubal ingredient that encourages the interrogation of microtubules from the tubindigenes and stabilizes the microtubules due to inhibited their landolyisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to a shirt of the normal dynamic reorganization of the mikrotubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mental cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumine conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into endothylene cells and has been demonstrated in the frame of vitro studies, which promotes the presence of Albumum in the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelift cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendelial transport has been conveyed by the gp-60-Albuminate and is due to the albuminous Proteins SPARC (secreted protein acidic in cysteine) is an paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of myxane for metastatic mammakarzinom is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-armed unrelated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III study study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic mammakarzinom were treated with myxane, which was given in the form of infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 is used as infusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic mammakarzinom.</seg>

<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician, who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases, for which the drug is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self-balance, abseamed was injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">Injection can also be made by the patient or its supervisor provided they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving a chemotherapy, the hereof-bell values should always be in the recommended area (between 10 and 12 grams per decilites in adults or between 9,5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients are prior to the treatment to ensure that no iron shortage consists, and iron utilities should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients suffering from chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, an anaemia can be caused by an erythropoiodine deficiency or by causing the body not sufficiently on the body-owned erythropoietin.</seg>

<seg id="375">The most common side-effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of cephalopathies (brain problems) such as sudden, continuous migrainous headaches and confusions.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abductors may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Disamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems, as further studies are required to make sure that by no allergic reactions are triggered.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Humanity Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that voting in compliance with the provisions of the European Union is proof that the drug has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public - this document is a summary of the European Public Health Authorities (EPAR), which explains how the studies conducted for Humanity (CHMP), in order to obtain recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Account is applied for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied only (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) in which metformin (a diabetes drug) are applied together with another diabetesmedial (dualtherapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients) that can be adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulphylharnosis or insulin, insulin can be maintained with the onset of account treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulphylharnotic or insulin is to be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's body can be improved in better and the blood sugar levels, whereby type-2 diabetes is better set.</seg>
<seg id="754">More than 1 400 patients have examined the efficacy of accounts in tripletherapy; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulphyl, in addition they received either account for up to 3.5 years either Actos or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in blood (glycosylified hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Account led to a reduction in HbA1c value, which suggests that blood sugar values were reduced in use of doses of 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with metformin and a sulphylharnist showed at 0.94%, while the additional Gabe of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of accounts and insulin in 289 patients was examined, patients who took account in addition to insulin, a reduction of HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patient, which also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with accounts were visual dysfunctions, infections of the upper respiratory tract (colds), gaining weight and hypothesia (reduced sensitivity to friction).</seg>
<seg id="760">Accounts may not be applied to patients who may possibly be supersensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure, or diabetic ketoaziy (high ketone level - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="762">October 2000, the European Commission awarded the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to distribute Actos by Actos in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, domed and carry on one side the marking "15" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also displayed for combination associated with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted and inappropriate at the metformin due to contraindications or incompatibility (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazon in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients suffering from the presence at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain or furnace, especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure, weight gain and oils, when pioglitazone is applied in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">Cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovascular disease has been performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver disease (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone should not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased to the 3 times the upper limit of the standard range, the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control again.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torso, loss of appetite and / or darker hardn, the liver enzymes are checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient treatment is continuing with pioglitazone should be led up to the prescribing parameters of clinical assessment.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated that can be found by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of a tick, the therapy with pioglitazone occurred slightly reduction of the middle hemobell values (relative reduction by 4%) and the hematokrits (relative reduction by 4.1%).</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative-controlled studies with pioglitazon in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3-4%) and to a lower extent also in patients among sulphylharnosis and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and the hematrits by 1-3%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of the increased insulin-sensitivity consists in patients, the pioglitazone as oral two or triple-combination therapy with a sulphylharnist or as a branch-processing therapy with insulin, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the launch of the market, it was reported under the treatment of Thiacoldindions, including pioglitazone, about an occurrence or a deterioration of an antidiabetic maculaödems with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there are direct correlation between the intake of pioglitazon and the occurrence of maculaödems if patients report about interference in visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmologic assessment should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events regarding bone fractures, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The reduced fractures of 1.9 trictures per 100 patient-years in the women treated with pioglitazon were treated to women and 1.7 fractures per 100 patient-years in women, who were treated with a comparatively drug.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.7%; 0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to do a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be reached (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies of investigation of interactions have shown that Pioglitazon does not have any relevant effects on pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenyloumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptive pills, cyclosporin, calcium-channel blocker and HMGCoA reductamim are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrous (a Cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in AUC by Pioglitazone to the 3-fold.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) resulted in a reduction in AUC by Pioglitazon by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone, reduces the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance in maturely and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally, 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (from present data does not be invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary variation in the turgor and brake indexes of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone played ALT-ups over the threefold the upper limit of the standard range often on like among placebo but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulphones.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with previously advanced makvascular disease the incidence was a severe heart failure in Pioglitazon to 1.6% higher than under placebo if pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the launch of the market, it has rarely been reported on congestive heart failure in Pioglitazone, however, if Pioglitazone has been applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="795">There was a summary analysis of reports of undesirable events regarding bone brood, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazon treated groups and about 7.400 patients in the groups treated with comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the over a period of 3.5 years running proactive study, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazon, compared to 23 / 905 (2,5%) in patients who were treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">During intake the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day more than seven days were no symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to function through an activation of specific kernel-receptors (Peroxisome Proliferor-g (PPAR-g)) which leads to an increased insulin-sensitiveness of liver, fats and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be demonstrated that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose recovery in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazon versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to the release of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 treatment months).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years after the onset of therapy, a blood sugar check was defined (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) by Pioglitazone at 69% of the patients treated under Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="802">In an placecontrolled study on 12 months, patients whose blood sugar have been inadequate, despite a three-month improvement phase with insulin, to pioglitazone or placebo randomized.</seg>
<seg id="803">Patients under pioglitazon reduced the average HbA1c - value by 0.45%, compared to the patients, who continue only insulin; a reduction in insulin in the group treated with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="804">Clinical trials over a year showed below pioglitazon through a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotions compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazon (Monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was evaluated in a small, 18 weeks essay by type-2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, compared to placebo a reduction in total plasma-glycemic acids and the free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as trivial, however clinically observed significantly increased LDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="807">Clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced pioglitazon compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide the total plasenglyzeride and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol levels.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, there is no statistically significant increase in the LDL cholesterol levels observed while using metformin and Gliclacide diminished values were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study more than 20 weeks the Pioglitazon is not only the sober-electric triglycerides, but also improved the biglycerization level, this both via an effect on the triglyzerid absorption or the hepatic Triglyczerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced makrovascular disease were randomized in groups of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy either Pioglitazon or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the top concentric pioglitazone usually reaches 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV does not correspond to the efficacy of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II minimal is marked.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaktionsstudies could be proven that Pioglitazone does not affect the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Digoxin, Warfarin, phenyloumon and Metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with Gemfibrous (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 - Inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8-inductor) or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral use of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in subjects (55%) and a lower extent in the Harn (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone is about man 5-6 hours, and that of the entire active metabolites is at 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentration of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy volunteers, but the rates of the oral Clearance of the mother subsubstance but resemble.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxiological studies played with mice, rats, dogs and apes after repeated administration, plasma-enhancement with haemlution, anaemia and reversible cardiac hypertrophia.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazon which reduces the hyperinsulinemia and increased insulin resistance in maturely and thus reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fat growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) were inducted with the rat increased incidences of hyperplAsia (for male and female rats) and tumors (with male rats) of the urinary epithelium.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family-adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other Thiazolidindions resulted in an increased frequency of collagen.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "30" and on the other hand the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="823">The reduced fractures of 1.9 trictures per 100 patient-years in the women treated with pioglitazon were treated to women and 1.7 fractures per 100 patient-years in women, who were treated with a comparatively drug.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.7%; 0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In a further study of two years the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with a pioglitazone or Gliclacide were examined.</seg>
<seg id="826">Clinical trials over 1 year showed below pioglitazon through a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin-Quotions compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study more than 20 weeks of Pioglitazon not only the sober Triglycerides, but also improved the borderless triglycerization level, this has an effect on the tracyglyczerid absorption as well as the hepatic Tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the target with regard to its primary end result, which combination a combination of the totality, non-killing coronal syndrome, stroke, akearisation and recvascularization of the leg arteries, set the results close that with the intake of pioglitazon are not associated cardiovascular risk.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to white, round, flat and carry on one side the marking "45" and on the other side the inscription "ACTOS."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of notifications from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone, showed an increased incidence of bone broods in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the proactive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.7%; 0.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparatively medication.</seg>
<seg id="832">In a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only has the sober triumphant triglycerides, but also improved in addition to an increased triglycerization level, this has an effect on the Triglyczerid absorption or the hepatic Triglyzerid synthesis.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was involved in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes for which the pancreas can not produce insulin, and type-2 diabetes in which the body is unable to utilize that insulin is effectively used.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance (glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in HbA1c-mirror, which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced with another humanist.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be applied in patients who may respond to human-sensitive (allergic) to Humanity (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of Actraphane may also be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can impact on blood sugar (the full list is available on pack-age).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Humanity Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Actraphane in the treatment of diabetes are outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="870">October 2002, the European Commission awarded the company Novo Nordisk A / S to distribute Actraphane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preliminary insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day when a rapid initials effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">Injection needle must be at least 6 seconds long under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar can be significantly improved by an intensified insulin therapy, the hypoglycemia-Warnsymptoms may be altered and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change with regard to strength, trademark (producer), insulin or insulin (rapid insulin, long-acting insulin, long-acting insulin, human insulin or insulin delivery), type of insulin (through recombinant DNA toward insulin origin) can cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If the switch to Actraphane is required in the patient with a dosage adjustment, it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after switching.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients where hypoglycemic reactions came after a change from animal to human insulin, reported that the early warning-symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>

<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore point out attention to all signs and symptoms, which should point out on possible malophageal irritation such as dysphageal irritation, pain at the slip or backward pain, or new or worsening heartening the medicine and obtain medical advice (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe öss side-effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or it depends on the occurrence of symptoms that will refer to an osophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is important that all instructional instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large areas of clinical studies with alendronage, no increased risk was observed, were rarely (after market launch) stomach and duodenalulzera, including some severe and associated with complications, reported (see Section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a lack of factor VIII, innate blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application are according to whether they are used to treat bleeding or to the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood clotting problems like bleeding in the joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced according to a method that is called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell that has been introduced into a gene (DNA), which makes it possible to form the formation of human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another in the European Union called Regreate, but it is made differently, so that the drug does not contain proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies to patients with severe to medium-sized Hhaemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was investigated with the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study the effectiveness of Advate was evaluated in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new bloodseptic with "excellent" or with "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pylute (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against the human scent factor VIII, mouse or hamstery or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1540">March 2004, the European Commission granted approval of Baxter AG for approval by Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution treatment are directed after the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, after the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">With the following ugly events, the factor VIII is supposed to sink under the specified plasmaspiegel (in% of the norm or in - / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection all 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeating until the pain and acute drawbacks are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection all 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment process, the dose of the injections and the frequency of the injections are given an appropriate provision of the factor VIII plates.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may vary in their response to factor VIII, different in vivo Recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis use prophylaxis use of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 by factor VIII per kg of body weight at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII is not reached, or if the bleeding is not controlled by a proper dose, a test must be carried out to prove a inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors, it is possible that the factor VIII is not effective, so other therapeutic interventions need to be woken.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The velocity of arrangement should be adjusted according to the patient, whereby a maximum injecting rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutral antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulant activity of factor VIII oriented IgG Immunglobulins, which is quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) pro ml plasma, using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Developing the risk, inhibitors to develop correlated with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII, whereas the risk within the first 20 expresdays is on the largest and dependent on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In the patients treated (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnesty, known inhibitors, to switch from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the re-emergence of (low-titrigen) inhibitors observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of the haemophilia A among women, there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs's largest number of patients were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients) who were all concerned with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk to the formation of inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (each 3 patients).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 10,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (incidence on the basis of available data is not estimable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of each patient (234). the unexpected waste of the blood clotting factor VIII is postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting has been maintained throughout time and both the factor VIII- Spiegel in plasma as well as the clearing-rate showed sufficient values on 15 postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to medium-severe rabbits A (§ 4 &lt; 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) just showed a patient after 26 expositions with ADVATE a low inhibitortiter (2.4 B.E. in the modified Bethesda approach).</seg>

<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients of a current clinical study made 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE patients treated inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and measured side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant wardness as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody against anti-CHO cell proteins, but otherwise no signs or symptoms indicated on an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial version of the CHMP, the CHMP has continued to be positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which makes a filing of PSURs all 6 months required, that the authorisation is to apply for a further renewal procedure for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited gave the Committee on Humanity's (CHMP) officially that the company withdraw its request for approval from Advexin to treat Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones, or the pastoral parts (tissues that connect other structures in the body, surrounds and bases) thereof.</seg>
<seg id="1642">It is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically so that it can carry one gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In the virus in Advexin, it is a "Adenovirus" that has been modified to make no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advance should have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein that is formed from the not defective in the human body existing p53-gene usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni Cancer, in which the p53-gene defect is broken, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company laid out data from a study with a patient prior to the Li-Fraumeni-cancer in the area of the tree, into the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After CHMP has examined the answers of the company on the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial documents the CHMP made available to 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to CHMP, not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin at Li-Fraumeni Tumore takes advantage of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration, as well as the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company has not proven adequately that Advantexin can be produced in a reliable way and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with patients.</seg>
<seg id="1653">"" "the company won't know the CHMP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients have currently in clinical trials or" "" "Coming Use" "" "programs with Advexin." ""</seg>
<seg id="1654">"changing active ingredient" means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components are instantly being released and the other slowly being released over a couple of hours.</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerobaze is used for treating the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, due to an allergy to pollen produced inflammation of the nasal passages) in patients with nasal mudskin swelling (coopholes).</seg>
<seg id="1656">In adults and adolescents 12 years of age, the recommended dose of aerobaze is twice daily, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (petrified nose).</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended, because the effects of the drug can be adjusted to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effectiveness were the changes in the gravity of the hay fever, which were reported by the patient before the onset of treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study the patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a journal and evaluated with a standard scala, how heavy the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In case of consideration of all hay fever, except the constipation of the nose reported the patients, the aerobaze took, over a decrease of symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35,9% of the patients who took pseudoephedrin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, patients in aerobaze showed a alleviation of symptoms at 37.4% over 26,7% of the patients who took the desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed for 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (inpetitionlessness), obstruction, headaches, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), infertility and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerobaze may be used in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, pseudo-ephedra or one of the other components, against adrenergic substances or Loratadin (a different drug for the treatment of allergies) are not applied.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerobaze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bottanged water (hypertension), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyroosis (hypertension), hyperthyrogenic stroke (caused by brain bleeding) or have a risk for a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a approval for the marketing of aeropaze in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but it is generally swallow (i.e. without breaking away, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerobaze should be applied in due to the lack of data for uncertainties and effectiveness (see Section 5.1) for children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days since long-term application can take the activity of pseudoephedrin with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After decrease the swelling of the mucosas in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since Aerinaze pseudoephedrin contains, the drug is also contraindicated in patients who are treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) or within 2 weeks after the completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combination with other vasoconstrils such as broocripitin, Pergothic, Dihydroergotamin or other decondentiva, which are used peroral or nasal as remote rhinoceros, ephedrine, oxymetacolin, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective, and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of the aeropaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not sufficient to address corresponding recommendations for dosage.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed about that treatment at the appearance of a hypertension or a tachykarst or of pagony, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headache) must be dropped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of following patient groups, for the treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmia • patients with hypertension • patients suffering from hypertension • patients with a myocardium in anamnese, diabetes mellitus, Blasenhalting or Brondepasm in anamnese.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerobaze can be used at least 48 hours before carrying out dermatological tests, since antihistaminika can prevent otherwise positive reactions to indicators of home actions or reduce their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin where erythromycin or ketoconazole were also administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes of the plasticentradine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the outcomes of psychomotor testing, no significant differences could be determined between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether desloratadine was consumed alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme required for the metabolism of desloratadin responsibles has not been identified yet, so interactions with other medicines cannot be excluded completely.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin inhibited in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-Glykopi.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The uncertainties of the use of aeropaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, experience from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, does not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to frequency in the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since Reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstritic properties of pseudoephedrin, aerobaze should not be applied in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should be elusive about this, however, that it can occur in very rare cases to a benomeness which can lead to an impairment of the traffic situation or the ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms can vary between a ZNS-depression (sedation, apnea, diminished mental attention, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collaps) and a ZNS stimulation (insomnia, hallusions, tremor, convulsions) with possible letterings.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, aggravating Might, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, excitement, perspirations, nausea, vomiting, vomiting, sorrel, Tinnitus, ataxie, visual dysfunctions and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">A ZNS stimulation is particularly probable in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (mouth-dry, peupillary arre and - dilation, Hautrums, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of the release of propositional cytocines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the eagle's P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aircraft including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was detected by no increased frequency of sleepiness in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase of blood pressure, a Tachykarst or manifestation of a ZNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients Aerinaze tablets were received.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of the aeropaze tablets, determined by the total cores for the symptom (except nose-sakes), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze pills in view of the abstain effect, determined by the nose-sskin, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2 week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of Aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study for pharmacogenetics from Aerinaze is desloratadwithin 30 minutes after the administration in the plasma detectable.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerobaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days the fly-weight of desloratadine, 3-hydroxydesloratadine and pseudo-hehedrin did reach 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacoinetic multi-specialist study, which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet for healthy adult subjects, has been found that four subjects of the desloratadine is severely contaminated.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interactivity study reveals that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrin after the sole gift of pseudoephedrin bioequivalent was exposure to gift of an aerobaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on the conventional studies on security vulnerabilities, toxicity, toxicity, and recyclability allow the prefabrication of clinical data with desloratadine to recognise no particular hazards to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than their individual components, and the observed effects were in general in connection with the ingredient pseudo-ephedrin.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproduced, the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrin was in a dosage of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not teratogen.</seg>

<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving around 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhinitis (including four studies at seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies to patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quaddles, impairment of sleep and performance at the day) before and after six-week treatment was determined.</seg>
<seg id="1724">There were other studies submitted to prove that the body adds the syrup to the solution and the melting tablets in the same way utilized as the tablets and the use in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies have been taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius to an average decrease of the symptom (symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the removal of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria, the decrease of the symptom was after six-week treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% compared to placebo-treated patients.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against desloratadine, Loratadin or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">January 2001, the European Commission awarded the European Commissioner SP Europe for approval by Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once daily, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent rhinitis) and Urtikaria (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There are limited experience in clinical trials to effectiveness in the use of desloratadin for young people aged from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should occur in accordance with the previous disease expiration and may end after the end of symptoms and can be re-recorded at their re-emergence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the Persian allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) can be recommended to patients during allergy periods.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in the framework of clinical trials involving desloratadin tablets where erythromycin or Ketoconazole were also administered (see under Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study a clinical effect was not amplified at the current intake of aserius and alcohol (see below 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should be elusive about this, however, that it can occur in very rare cases to benommenities, which can lead to an impairment of transport, or the ability to use machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">Clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urism, were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius as in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most frequently visited side effects caused more common than placebo were tiredness (1,2%), mouth-drying (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 teenage patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side-effect headaches, this occurred at 5.5% of the patients treated with desloratadine and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-multidose study, which were administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (ninety clinical dosage), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both the inhibition of the release of propositional cytocines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 out of human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the eagle's P-selection on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">Within the framework of a clinical study with multi-disciplinary, in the desloratadine in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily about 14 days was administered, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effects.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically pharmacological study, in the desloratadine in a dosage of 45 mg daily (which was administered over ten days per day, no extension of the QTc Intervalls was revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In an individual dosis- study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes of aircraft including the strengthening of subjective beats or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as Niesen, nasal secretion and itching of nose, itching, lacrimal and redness of the eyes and itching of the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms, alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as the incidence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As with the total-cores of the cargo to quality of life at Rhino-conjunctis was demonstrated, diminished Aerius effectively the exacerbated by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic Urtikaria has been analyzing for further forms of urticaria, since the underlying pathological research regardless of the etiology with different forms is similar and chronically patients can be rectified.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the histamine is an important factor in all urticular diseases, is expected to lead desloratadin except for chronic idiopathic urism also in other forms of urism to improve the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic idiopathic Urtikaria was Aerius effective in improving Pruritus and the reduction of the size and number of quaddles at the end of the first Dosisintervalls.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika with chronic idiopathic urism, the minority of patients who did not react to Antihistaminika, out of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in the buck to more than 50% was observed at 55% of patients treated with desloratadin patients compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and the wax is significant, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmaceutical study study, in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, was reached at 4% of the patients a higher concentration of desloratadine.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no clue to clinically relevant Kumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days before.</seg>
<seg id="1757">This is however not identified for the metabolism of desabolism of desloratadin responsible enzymes, however, so interactions with other drugs are not completely excluded</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin inhibits in-vivo not CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor a inhibitor of the P-Glykopi.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dosisstudy with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calorie breakfast) does not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The clinical trials made with desloratadin and Loratadin carried out preclinations in a comparable degree of exposure of desloratadine, no qualitative or quantitative differences concerning the toxicity of desloratadin and by Loratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined which antiviral medication has previously taken before, and the likelihood is that the virus will respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of maple according to body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Egenerase decreases in combination with other antiviral medicines the HIV volumes in blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">AIDS is not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the immune system and thus delay the development of suffering from AIDS, infections and disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was examined in combination with other antiviral medication, but without kavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults, which were previously not treated with proteasms.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Agenerase inhibitory increased by 206 adults, which had previously taken proteaspomer earlier, with other proteasms compared.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indication for the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with undetectable levels of HIV in blood (Viruslast) or the change of virus last after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously taken no proteasynx, after 48 weeks under Agenerase more patients had a viral last less than 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children decreased agenerase also the Viruslast, but however, treated by the children who were previously treated with proteasms, very few on the treatment mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults, who had previously been treated with proteasms, that had been treated with chionviolr increased medicine Agenerase the virus last after 16-week treatment as effective as other proteassigns:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patient with HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasms, it came under Agenerase, along with Ritonavir to a stronger waste of virus last after four weeks as with the patients who received their hitherto proteaslobster.</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (nausea), vomiting, rash and Fatima gue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 nogenerase may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Amspecavir or one of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may also not be applied in patients, the currant (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or drugs, which are just as agenerase and are detrimental in high concentrations in blood health.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, the Agenerase occupy, the risk of a lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), a osteopathy (die of bone tissue) or an immunreactivation syndroms (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Humanity Committee (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with other antiretroviral medication used to treat patients with proteasulators to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacoinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee established that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with kavir in patients who have previously taken no proteasynx, not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved in" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "as at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">October 2000, the European Commission granted the Glaxo Group Limited granted approval for the marketing of Agenerase in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is combined with other antiretroviral medication used to treat HIV-1- infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">For usual, agenerase capsules are supposed to be given to pharmacoinetic boosters from Amspecavir together with low doses of Ritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amspecavir should be performed taking into account the individual viral medication and the pre-treatment of patients (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amspecavir as a solution to take is around 14% lower than from Amspecavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution to arrive on a milligram per milligram was not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for agenerase capsules amounts to 600 mg Amspecavir twice daily along with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medication.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying add of Ritonavir (boostery), higher doses must be applied to Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for agenerase capsules is 20 mg Amspecr / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amspecavir which should not be exceeded (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacy, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of Ritonavir or other proteasms have not been studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years, due to the lack of data on uncertainty and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacoinetic data the dose of Agenerase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver-dysfunctions to 300 mg twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application is to be used in patients with mild or moderate liver-disorder in patients with severe liver-compulsive disorder (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase may not be given at the same time with drugs which possess a low therapeutic width and also substrates substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations, the currant (hypericum perforatum) may contain, may not be used due to the risk of reduced plastickonzentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of rectomavir during the intake of Amspecavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with maple does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination.</seg>
<seg id="1941">For usual, agenerase capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of chionavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medication (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an antiretroviral therapy therapy, have an increased risk of severe liver impacts with potentially deadly disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously reduced liver function including a chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function under an antiretroviral therapy therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluoriasone or other glukokorticosteroids that changes over CYP3A4 is not recommended, unless the potential benefits of a treatment exceeds the risk of systemic corticosteroiesis including morbus Cushing and Supplement of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including Rhabdomyolysen.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines, which can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenyltoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Standards Ratio), are available methods for determining the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasmaspiegel of Amspecavir less effective (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Amspecavir can be the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptive pills, however, the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">When methadon is given simultaneously with Amspecavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opitioned symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolts of the agenerase solution for inclusion, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be placed in duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms, or the mucosas are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received an antiretroviral therapy including proteaskes, was reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>

<seg id="1957">At HIV-infected patients with severe immunodefect can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections that lead to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multi-factorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, heavy immunosuppression, higher Body Mass Index), cases of osteopathy, especially in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term application of an antiretroviral therapy therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4-substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase may not be given at the same time with drugs which possess a low therapeutic width and also substrates substrates of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase is not allowed to be combined with medicinal drugs whose active ingredients are mostly used via CYP2D6 and are connected to the increased plasmaspiegel with heavy and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin was a 82% reduction in AUC by Amspecavir, which can lead to a virological failure and lead to a settlement development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In trying to equivoke the humiliated Plasmaspiegel by a dose of other protein inhibitors in combination with kavir, very often were observed undesirable effects on the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Currant (hypericum perforatum) The serum mirror of Amspecavir can be humiliated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with currants (hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient is already endorsed by curweeds, the speckled levels are and, if possible to check the virus last and put the currant.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for any of the drugs is not required when Nelfinavir is administered together with Amspecavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for cmax at about 30% lower if Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) in combination with Amspecavir capsules (600 mg twice a day) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials dosages of 600 mg Amspecavir twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily applied to the efficacy and uncertainties of this treatment schematas.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degraded when Amspecavir (750 mg twice daily) in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) was administered.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values by Amspecavir in plasma, which was reached in combination of Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir twice daily), approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) in combination with 100 mg of kavir twice daily is administered.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosages recommended for the simultaneous administration of Amspecavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, there is a engmaschige guard recommended, since the efficacy and inconsistency of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There has been no pharmacoinetic study carried out in combination with Didanosin combination with didanosin, but is recommended for at least one hour apart from Didanosin and Agenerase at least one hour (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, with Gfavir in combination with Amspecavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) no dosage is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amspecavir and Saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both proteassigns would become low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protein-previously and available limited data suggests that Nevirapin the serum concentration of Amspecavir could possibly be sunk.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advisable when Delavirdin could be less effective because of the decreased and possibly subtherapeutic plasma tiles.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are applied together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring is supposed to be made, as an exact prediction of the effects of combining amspecavir and seronavir on Delavirdin difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous gift of Amspecavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin around 193% and hence a rise in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is required for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenerase, becomes a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmaceutical chemist studies with axiom in combination with erythromycin were not done, however, the plasma of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg FosamSpecavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to a increase in the Cmax of Ketoconazole on the 2.69ple compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg Ketoconazole every day without simultaneous use of Fosamkled avir with kavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitor induction of CYP3A4, can, if they are applied together with maple, possibly lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored with toxic reactions that are linked to these medicines if they are applied in combination with maple.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data from other proteascertain it is advisable that Antazida is not taken at the same time as agenerase, since it can come to residual effects.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anti-convulsiva which are known as an enzyme phenobarbital, phenobarbital, carbamazepin), with Amspecavir can lead to a humiliation of the plasmetaspiegel of Amspecavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">The serum concentrations of calcium-concentrations, such as Amlodipin, diluted pin, Nifedipin, Nifedipin, Naxdipin, and Verapamil can be increased 10 by Amspecavir, thus increasing the activity and toxicity of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The simultaneous stop with Agenerase can increase their plastickonzentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors in conjunction with hypotension, visual dysfunctions and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical trial, in the Ritonavir 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionat intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days of propionat intranasal (4 times daily), while the endogenous cortisol increased by about 86% (90% reduction interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with kavir is not recommended along with these Glukokorticosteroids, unless that the potential benefits of a treatment weighs a risk of systemic corticosteroiesis (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">At HMG CoA reductase inhibitors like Lovastatin and simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, have pronounced creases of plasma swear at simultaneous administration of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plastic maspieves increased these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors to myopathy, including a Rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with Amspecavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It will be a frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations up to stabilise the mirror, since the plasma concentration of cyclosporin, Rapamycin and Tacrolimus can be increased by simultaneous makeravir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase may not be used together with an unbiased midazolam (see Section 4.3), while at the same time used by Agenerase with parenteral Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous application of parenteral midazolam with other proteaspoepors indicate a possible increase in the plasma-grain from Midazolam to the 3- to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadon is administered together with Amspecavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opitioned symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of Ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historic comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given, like the Amspecavir- dose to adjust if Amspecavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants, together with Agenerase, an increased control of INR (International Standards Ratio) is recommended for the possibility of a depreciation or reinforcement of the anti-throwaic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of Ritonavir on hormonal contraceptive pills is not foreseeable so as alternative methods are recommended to contraception.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Meticulous monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended at the simultaneous gift of Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful consideration of possible usage for the mother compared to the possible risks for fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk lactic rats, Amspecavir-related substances were proven, but it is not known whether Amspecavir on people are over into the mother's milk.</seg>

<seg id="2002">The further development of the offspring including fertilisation and reproductive capacity was not compromised by the administration of Amspecavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The uncertainties of Agenerase was examined in adults and children aged 4 years onwards in controlled clinical trials in combination with different antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the effects associated with the agenerase treatment were slightly to moderate, occurred early on and led rarely to the treatment break.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events is not clear whether or not they are used in connection with the treatment of agenerase or another at the same time to HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of underage.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side-mentioned side-effects stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which with proteasms not received patients 1200 mg of generase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (grade 2 to 4), seen by the examination, compared to the study medication, and with more than 1% of patients were performed, as well as under the treatment laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) are listed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The antiretroviral medication therapy has been associated with an redistribution of body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripherals and fast underskin tissues, hypertrophy of breasts and thorax fat tissues (embroirous of fat).</seg>
<seg id="2009">In 113-retrospective persons, who had been treated with Amspecavir in combination with Lamivudin / Zidovudine over a middle duration of 36 weeks, was only observed a case (pins) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006 occurred at 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients under Amspecavir 7 cases (11%) compared to 27 cases (11%) at 241 patients under Indinavir in combination with various NRTIs for a medium duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0,001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematly or makulopapully nature, with or without juckiness and were usually performed during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amspeculating.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoncology have been reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term application of an antiretroviral therapy therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">At the time the introduction of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI-treated patients, the 600 mg of generase twice daily, together with low dosified kavir (grade 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4) and laboratory changes (grade 3 to 4) and CPD values, which were conducted among patients, the Agenerase, together with low dosified kavir, very often occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose the patient is based on signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) when required, necessary supportive policies are required.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amspecavir binds to the active center of HIV-1 protesters and thereby prevents the processation viral and GAG-pol- polyproteination levels with the result of an formation of non-infectious virus particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amspecavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB has been studied in both acute and chronically infected with lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, Cem-CCRF, H9) as well as at the peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of Amspecavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µm in acute cells and is 0.41 µm in chronic cells</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was primarily investigated the safety of the drug, but it was also measured its effectiveness (by studying its effect in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under five years of Aldurazyme the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the actual children involved in the study showed a normal high liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin pain, pain pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), hot pain, fever and reactions to the infusion place.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen satiation (a measuring size of lung function), Tachykarst (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may respond to Laronidase (allergic) to larvae or one of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>

<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will get patients who receive the Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted the company Genzyme Europe B.V. to distribute authorisation from Aldurazyme throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of the human α-L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammals (Chinese Hamster Ovary, Eierstock of Chinese Hamsters).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is used for long-term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a mukopolysacchariosis I (MPS I, α-L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with aldurazyme should take place through a doctor, the experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial Infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient carries this, every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients can not be recommended as a automation scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure, has not been determined, and for these patients can not be recommended as a substitute scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2291">With Aldurazyme patients may develop infusion-conditioned reactions that are defined as any associated side-effect, which occurs during infusion or until the end of the intraday (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">This is why specifically these patients should continue to be engmaschige for this reason, and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be done in an appropriate clinical environment, in the revitalisation process for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG-antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As little experience in dealing with the resumption of the treatment after a longer break, must be cautious due to the theoretical risk of hypersensitive reaction after a break of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the onset of infusion using medicines (antihistaminika and / or anti-pyretika) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of an easy or medium-severe infusion response, treatment with antihistaminika and acetaminosol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or a reduction in the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate where the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion response, the infusion must be halted until the symptoms are brought to decrease, a treatment with antihistaminika and acetaminopol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be re-added with a reduction in infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate where the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistaminika and acetaminosol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate, in which the predetermined reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be applied at the same time with chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular reception of larvae.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not leave directly or indirect detrimental effects on pregnancy, the embryonic development, birth and post-natale development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data on newborns, which were expelled from Laronidase on the mother's milk, is recommended, while treatment with aldurazyms not to satisfy.</seg>
<seg id="2304">The side effects in clinical trials were primarily referred to as infusion-related reactions that have been observed at 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and at 35% of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years of treatment (duration of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Unwanted effects associated with Aldurazyms that were observed during the Phase 3- study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 and older in a total treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table below: very common (≥ 1 / 100); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, serious reactions occurred, including bronze-pasm, respiration and facial oils (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children unsolicited pharmaceutical effects associated with Aldurazyme, which was reported in a phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe expiration and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, reported are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients came to a Seroconversion within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment, with a heavy expandular form during the age of 5 (average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Until the end of the phase 3 study (or up to a premature retirement from the study), at 13 / 45 patients there were no detectable antibodies (RIP) Assay detectable antibodies, including 3 patients, in which it never came to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lacked up to low testosterone levels led a robust reduction of the GAG mirrors in the Harn while in patients with high antibody titres was a variable reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase 3 study and one in the Phase 2 study) showed a marginal up to low neutrality and effect on enzymatic Laronidase- activity in vitro which did not affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reduction of GAG in the Harn.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to stand in connection with the incidence of adverse drug interactions, even though the occurrence of unwanted drug interactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The basis for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme.</seg>
<seg id="2315">According to intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and recorded cells into lysosomes, most likely about Mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were examined in a randomised, double blind, placecontrolled phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, the majority of patients were reported by the central phenotype and only one patient proved the heavy phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients have been recruited if they had a forciated expirationic volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meter.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary outcomes for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-Minut- salestest test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were then recruited for an open-label extension study where they received another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week 100 E / kg Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme were treated to enhancing the lung function and the capacity to be presented in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as emerged from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease of the percentage of the percentage of the percentage is clinically significant over this period and the absolute volume of lung-volumes raised to proportional to the body size of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a hepatronage in front of treatment 22 (85%) by the end of the study a normal liver size.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the GAG mirror in the Harn (µg / mg Creatinin) was established until the end of the study remained constant.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease-line between the patients, which has been taken into account by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes collapsing for five efficacy approval, movement of the school joint (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">There was a one-year open phase 2 study conducted in which aldurazyms were examined by twenty patients who were at the time of their recording in the study of 5 years (16 patients with severe failure form and 4 with the middle form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased due to increased GAG- mirror in the harn in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) and a weight gain (n = 3) and all 4 patients with the average expiration form reported a normal mental development speed, whereas in the elderly patients with severe expandular form had limited only limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a Phase 4 study investigations have been carried out to pharmacogenic effects of different aldurazyme-doautomation schemata at the GAG levels in the Harn, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks may be in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions, a reasonable alternative; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of this two doautomation schemata is equivalent.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (a other drug against cancer), which is still not removed from chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malignant" (vicious - cancer), and "malignant" (vicious or metastatic) non-single "lung cancer that is not attacks the turnaround cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used in patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regimen than any therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin C) and injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">When Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin in addition a "anti-emetic" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to prevent a fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side-effects occur, the treatment should be swallowed up, or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetrefractures slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells, which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioms, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had never received any chemotherapy against their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, which had previously been treated with chemotherapy (docetaxel) with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with Gemcitabine (a further medicine for cancer) and both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin, survived at an average of 12,1 months, compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of Cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously had received chemotherapy previously, the average survival time with Alimta 8,3 months, compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">However, in both studies, patients, in which cancer did not attack the turnaround cells, in the administration of Alimta for longer survival, than with the comparatively drug.</seg>
<seg id="2367">September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to grant permission for transporting Alimta in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each disteeple bottle has to be solved with 4.2 ml 0.9% Natripchloride injection resolution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The appropriate volume of the necessary Do- SIS is taken from the breakwater bottle and is diluted with 0.9% Natridichloride injection resolution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml. (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monootherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with load- Kal advanced or metastatic non-small bronchial carcinoma (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² (KOF) administered as a intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin amounts to 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetpipe-infusion on the first day each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF administered as a intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Reduction in incidence and severity of home actions must be given the day before and on the day of the Pemetremixed gift, as well as on the day after the treatment a corticosteroid.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of Pemetrexed must be taken at least 5 doses of folic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetpipe dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intra-muscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first Pemetrexed dose as well as after every third conversion cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive Pemetrexed should be created prior to any gift a complete blood image - including a differentiation of the leucocytes and a Thrombolic census.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphate (AP), aspartate Transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be &lt; 3-fold of the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose check must take place under rescent of the Nadir of the blood image or the maximum non-hematological toxin of the forecasted therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-hematology Toxicity ≥ degree 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), treatment with ALIMTA must be interrupted until the patient gets the value in front of the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA has to be broken when in patients following 2 dosisreductive Toxicity or non-hematological Toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so- continue with the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above in comparison to patients at the age of 65 is an increased risk-effective risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non-sufficient data on uncertainty and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical studies, in patients with a creatinin Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min no tin adapts necessary, which go beyond the recommended Dosisadaptations for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data base in patients with a creatinin Clearance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function regulators of &gt; the 1.5-fold of the upper Bilirubin- border value and / or transacasenvalue of &gt; the 3,0 points of the upper limit value (at the presence of liver metastatic) or &gt; 5,0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver enhancement) is not specifically examined in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the button marker and Pemetremixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophilatelic number restored a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ and the thydial number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute Neutrophilatelic number, Throar number and maximally non-hematology as they have been observed in the previous treatment cycles - (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-leak toxicity such as neutropenie, febrile neutropenie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neutropenie was puffed if a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 has taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients need to be relied with relapsed patients, folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measure to reduction treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium kidney failure (Creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous taking non-epileptic antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylali- cy@-@ acid (&gt; 1,3 g daily) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and mindset (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients, for which treatment with Pemetreated is intended to avoid the intake of NSAIDs with a long half-time duration for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients where these events arose, had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing hypertension or Diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, in patients with clinically significant liquid accumulation in the transcellular room a drainage of the ergometer can be weighed before the Pemetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocarids, and crebrovascular events have been reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed occasions when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason the simultaneous application-filled life diaphragm (excluding yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of an irreversible skull must be traced by Pemetremixed, men should be cautioned in front of the treatment - should be advised to consult with respect to sperm production.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) you can manage high doses of nonsteroidal anti-oxidation (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsaline acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) to a decreased sequencing with the result of a multiplication of side-effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsaline acid can be applied in high dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or Acetylsalicyl- acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and mindset - Tens 2 days after therapy with Pemetrexed (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is available with regard to interaction potential with NSAIDs with a long half-time such as piro- xicam or rofecoxib, the simultaneous application must be avoided with Pemetrexed for at least 5 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Standards ratios) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for using Pemetremixed with pregnant women, but just like ande- ren Antimestolites are expected to be severe in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetremixed may not be applied during pregnancy, except if necessarily reflexibly and after careful consideration of the utility for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage of reproductive capacity is made by Pemetremixed, men should be pointed out before the treatment beginning to obtain consultation regarding the sperm blockage.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed into the mother's milk goes over and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2621">In the days following chemotherapy, Aloxi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies inhibited Palonosis, the targeted activity of the five analysed chemotherapeutic agents (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabine, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical trial there showed no significant pharmacocular interaction between a singular dose of Palonosis and a Steady state- concentration of Metoclopramids, one CYP2D6-Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a population-based pharmacocultic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CYP2D6-inhibitors (Dexamethason and Rifampicin, Fluoxetine, Semitidin, Rinidine, Ranitidin, sertralin and Terbinafin) had no significant impact on the clearing of Palonosis.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experiences regarding the use of Palonotic tron in human pregnancies are not before, therefore Palonotic tron should not be applied in pregnant women, unless it is considered to be considered by the treating doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micrograms to observe side-effects (a total of 633 patients) that were at least possibly with aloxi in the context, headaches (9%) and obstruction (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitive actions and reactions to the administration of the administration (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage similar frequencies of undesirable events have shown themselves like in the other docking groups; there were no dose of drugs to watch.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been performed, however, due to the large number of distribution, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy with a Aloxian overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients, which received a moderate-etogenic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2, Carboplatin, &lt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide, or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.1 hours) or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-time 7.1 hours), which was given every day 1 without Dexamethason IV.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients, which received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cyclophosphamide and Dacarbathes, with patients compared to 32 mg Ondansetron, which were given every day 1 intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate-etogenic chemotherapy and the study with strongly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies to indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of Palonosis agents were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and EKG parameters including the QTc intervalls, including the relevant effects from Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosis has the ability to block the iteracy channels involved in the ventricular de- and repolarisation of the iteracy channels and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy research was the assessment of the EKG-effects of i.V. administered Palonosis in single dots of 0.25, 0,75 and 2,25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous Gabe follows an initialization of plasticconcentric, a slow elimination of the body with an average season-time duration of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentrate time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dosage range of 0.3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportionally.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to intravenous Gabe of Palonosis, 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase from the 1 and day 5 common (± SD) increase in the Palonosis-plastickonzentration at 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">From pharmacocular simulations, it emerged that at once daily intravenous Gabe were comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) with the value of 0.75 mg measured. however, the Cmax is higher than 0.75 mg higher.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated over the kidneys, and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, compared to Palonosis, above less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies to metabolisation have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser extent, the isooCYP3A4 and CYP1A2 is involved in the Metabolism of Palonosis.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After a intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron were found about 80% of the dose within 144 hours in urine, Palonosis. made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a singular form of intravenous, in 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renale Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Although in patients with severe liver-disorder the terminale elimination time and the average systemic exposure to Palonosis is increased, however, a reduction in the dose is however not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies have been observed only after expositions which are regarded as sufficiently above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, which indicates a low relevance to the clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 from preclinical studies revealed that Palonosis is only blocking in very high concentrations of ion channels that are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the shareholders of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosis (each dose posted in about 30times of the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, led to a multiply incidence of liver tumors, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary gland) and skin tumors in rats, but not on mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not completely known, but due to the used high doses and since aloxi when humans are destined for the unique application, the relevance of these results will be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">June 2006, the Committee on Humanpharmaceupon (CHMP) adopted a negative report, in which the approval of the approval for the approval of the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C medication by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection resolution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that alheon a biological medicine named Roferon-A should be similar to the same vasian effective component already approved in the EU (also "Reference pharma").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-prolonged) hepatitis C (one caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">When a microscopic examination shows the liver tissue damage, moreover, the values of the liver-enzymotransmitters (ALT) increased in the blood standard.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast into which a gene (DNA) was brought to the formation of the active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that cover the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance, composition and purity of the drug, action, safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of the Alpheon's efficacy was compared to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study was measured, as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after the treatment were reported on the drug (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">Furthermore, concerns have been expressed, that the data is not sufficient for the stability of the drug and of the drug drug.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of patients with hepatitis C, which spoke to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A, was similar in the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon the illness flammated more patients with more patients than with the reference practitioner; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Aside from this, the test used in the study was analysed how far the drug is immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), not sufficient validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (one with crust formation and small ininfected species of skin infection) and small ininfected species (cracking or cutting), depreciation and paralyzed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections, detectable or probably caused by methicillinresistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo against this type of infections may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied in patients aged 9 months from the age of nine, but in patients under the age of 18 must not exceed 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should study the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works through blockade of bacterial warfare (the parts of the bacterienzelle, where proteins are produced) and inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indication of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was sealed after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected Hauts, Altargo and Cefalexin similar rating: if the results of both studies were taken together with Hauts, about 90% of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, has been found that Altargo is caused in the treatment of abscesses (vanised cavity) or infections that were detectable or probably caused by MRSA, not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee on Humanpharmaceupon (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the advantages of Altargo during short-time treatment of the following superficial skin infections are outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small inpetitions, strips or paralysed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd received an approval for the marketing of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients, in which no improvement shows within two or three days, should be examined once more and be considered an alternative therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of raising or severe local irritation by using Retapamine Salbe, treatment broke down, the anointing carefully wiped carefully and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be applied to treat infections in which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">Clinical trials in secondary studies were the effectiveness of Retapamulin in patients with infections that were caused by a methicillin-resistant sthylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy is to be considered, if after a 2-3-day treatment there is no improvement or a deterioration of the infected place.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the small plasma concentration, which have been achieved in humans according to topical skin or infected superficial wounds, a clinically relevant subframing in vivo is not to be expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous gift of 2-times daily 200 mg Ketoconazole increased the average retapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical skin of 1% retapamity Salbe on shopped skin from healthy adult men around 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the small systemic exposure to topical application in patients, Dosisadaptations are not considered necessary if topical retracts are applied during a systemic treatment with CYP3A4 Inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproduction of production according to oral intake and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and fowl / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamine Salbe should be applied only during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clear and the use of Retapamulin of the gift of a systemic antibiotic treatment is preferable.</seg>
<seg id="2696">When deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / ended or the therapy with Altargo continues / ended, between the benefits of breastfeeding for the baby and the benefits of altargo therapy for the woman are considering.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials to 2150 patients with superficial skin infections, the Altargo has been applied, the most commonly reported side effect irritation during the date, which regarded approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Operation about Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivatives of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Plurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The effect mechanism of Retapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of bacterial protein synthesis by interacting on a particular bond-unit of the bacterial reef, which differs from the ties of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data point out that the Binding position of the Bosnian protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomalen and the Peptidyltransferasecentre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By loyalty to this connection point inhibit Pleuromutiline the PeptidylTransfer, blocking partial P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s ribosomous subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should be due to the local prevalence of resistance to the use of Retapamulin on at least some infection forms, a consultation through experts should be ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the In-vitro activity of Retapamulin towards S.aurreus, irrespective of whether the isolate was sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of failure to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of tribes with additional viral factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidine) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Residing In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamine Salbe performed daily under occlusion on intact and cheaped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children), the 1% Retapamine Salbe received twice daily for 5 days to the topographical treatment of secondary wounds, individual plasma experts were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients each before the medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic absorption of humans according to topical application of 1% Salbe on 200 cm2 (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibiting.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retapamulin in human liver microsomnia was primarily conveyed by CYP3A4, under the lower participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity to rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review on pleasures and / or chromosomale effects in the mouse-Lymphoma test and in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rats bowel test for the In-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats at female rats at oral doses of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure to the highest valued exposure to people (topical application on 200 cm2).</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryos study on rats were detected at oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to the ≥ 3 times of estimated human exposure (see above)), development stoxicity (decreased body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and matologic toxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the permit for inspection has to make sure that an pharmaceuticals system, as is present in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation process (version 6.2) and works before the product is marketed, and as long as the product has been marketed its market.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the approval for the marketing request is obligated to carry out the detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical sector activities, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with CHMP.</seg>

<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms show at the treated point, you should end the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the area that is treated with Altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose, or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the sage breaks out on one of these surfaces, wash the spot with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is applied to protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases that affect the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years that are not immun against these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is applied within two doses of existing vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason ambirix may only be used when the immunisation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and ensures that the vaccinations of two doses can lead to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or other hepatitis-A- or -B vaccine will be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by bringing the immune system (the natural defences of the body), as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Once a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and generates antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the approved vaccine Twinrix adults and since 1997 approved vaccination Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases but are administered Twinrix adults and Twinrix children as part of an existing vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix are identical ingredients, some of the data, which support the application of Twinrix adults, also as a testament to the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vaccinated children, which had developed a protective antibody in the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six months and a 12 months gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix led us between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children a month after the last injection to the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix had a six-hour gap between the injections and a 12-month gap between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine) are headache, loss of appetite, pain an the injecting site, redness, matrices (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may respond to patients who may be insensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic) are not used.</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002, the European Commission issued the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for transporting Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardization plan for the Grundimmunization of Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose of between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a refresher age is needed for Hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B, it can vaccinated with the corresponding monovulation vaccines or with a combination-simple vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-oxidant anti-hepatitis viruses (anti-HBsAg) - and anti-hepatitis-A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies are in the same scale as after vaccination with the respective monovarian vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet completely secured, if immuno-competent persons identified on a hepatitis A- vaccination, a refresher age can be protected as protection as they are also protected by no more detectable antibodies as immunological memory.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injurious ingredients, for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the gift of the vaccine, the relevant ways of medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the Standardization scheme is recommended, the 360 ELISA units formable Hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinable Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the patient-patient and persons with disorders of the immune system, according to the basis of the basis, no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibody is achieved, so in these cases the gift of other vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could result in the gluteal muscle for an optimal impeller success, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, with Throgenic cytopenie or blood clotting disorder, Ambirix can be ineffected subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular gift.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix in the second year of life in the form of a separate injector, tetusuläc, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenza type b vaccine administered (DTPa-IPV / hib) or with a combined masern- mumps vaccine administered was the immune response to all antigens sufficiently (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defective needs to be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study, which was carried out with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever comparable to the incidence, which was observed in the earlier Thiomersal- and preservative vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials 2029 vaccines have been administered in a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years the compatibility of ambirix had compared with the 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and skill at a calculation basis per vaccination ambirix, but not on a calculation basis per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix at 50,7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% at the Probank after the gift of a dose of 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination reported 66.4% of the commission, the Ambirix had received, about pain, compared to 63.6% with the subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-Dos- Combinational simplex.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the incidence of maternity was comparable to high (that is, over the whole vaccine at 39.6% of the probanden that received Ambirix, compared with 36.2% at the Probanden that received the 3-doses combinant.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence affected by pain and maternity was low and comparable to that after administration of the combinational simplex that was observed with the 3-canned vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study in 1- up to 11-year vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable with that, which was observed with the 3-doses combinant simple with 360 ELISA-units deactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2759">At the 6- to 11- year-old, however, after vaccination with ambirix had been a common occurrence of pain (on the injecting site) per dose, not pro-tape, reports.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations, which reported via severe side-effects during the 2-layer vaccinations with ambirix or during the 3-doses-vaccine adjuvant with 360 ELISA- units formactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials that were carried out at vaccinations at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconvertible rates for anti-HAV were 99.1% one month after the first dose and 100% after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-hbs were 74.3% one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, to month 6 administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- up to 15-year-old, 142 two doses received ambirix and 147 the default combinant with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">With the 289 people whose immunoasseness was worthless, the Seroproteer rates (SP in the table below) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after Gabe of the 3-Dosenimpfd are significantly higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune response that in a clinical comparison study by 1- to 11-year-olds have been reached a month after the complete vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies the vaccinations were either a 2-layer vaccinations with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA-units deactivated HA virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface.</seg>
<seg id="2767">For individuals who were at the time of the Grundimmunisation between 12 and 15 years old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies could be proven for at least 24 months after the immunisation with ambirix in 0-6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response reaction against both antigens was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 doses of a combination simpatic, consisting of 360 ELISA units deactivated Hepatitis- A-virus and 10 µg recombinable hepatitis B surface is detected in a canned volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical trial at 12- up to 15-year-old, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-hbs antibodies can be compared to immunisation in the 0-6- months vaccination scheme is compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose ambirix in the second year of life at the same time with the refresher, tetussic acid, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenza vaccine (DTPa-IPV / hib) or with the first dose of a combined masculine-mumps vaccine administered was the immune response to all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed for the current formulation similar seroproteection and seroconversionrates as for the earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired have a dark urine, a blending face, yellow skin and / or eyes (Yellow-looking) and other symptoms that may possibly be a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not be completely protected from an infection with hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you are infected / Your Child in front of the administration of both Lyme disease or Hepatitis B virus, is (although you / your child can not feel uncomfortable or sick) a vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those following a Hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection, cannot be conveyed.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If you have an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any component of this vaccine, including Neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can express itself through juckery rashes, airpressure or swelling of the face or the tongue. • if you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a serious infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a patient protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and prior to the filing of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">With a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formal Hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content to effective ingredients is usually administered a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccination protection prior to completion of the vaccinations.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes Ambirix will suffer from those who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you have weakened / your child due to a disorder or treatment in your body's body, or if you / your child undergo a tick-move.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of those individuals on the vaccine cannot be sufficient, so that a blood test can be required to see how much the reaction to the vaccine is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Saw your doctor if you / your child taking additional medicines / adopts (including those who have been given without prescription) or if you / her child was recently vaccinated / was administered or Immunglobulins (antibodies), or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">But it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given simultaneously with Ambirix, should be vaccinated in separate places and as possible as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If ambirix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of Immunglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be adequate.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix or nursing women are not administered unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated both against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about specific other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs to 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data that has been known since issuance of the first permit for inspection, the CHMP came that the value-risk ratio for ambirix stays positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However its ambirix had only been placed in a member state (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited because of the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete endzymective or with hyperammoneemoencephalopathy (brain damage, as a result of high ammonium concentration) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonaps is divided - divided into several solvent to meals - swallowed up among the food or over a Gastrostomieschlauch (through the abdomen in the stomach of leading hose) or a nasal sonde (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose) administered.</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study, since Ammonk could not be compared with any other treatment or with placebo (a placebo drug that is to be compared with no substance).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also result in loss loss, a decrease in blood, depression, irritability, headaches or taste, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, uncomfortable body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Humanity Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that ammonds in patients with malfunctions of the urinary cycle has to prevent high ammonious values effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonaps was approved in "extraordinary circumstances, since due to the rarity of the disease, there were only limited information on this medicine at the time of approval.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indexed to all patients where a complete endorous lack is already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late maniac form (incomplete Enzymective defect, which manifests itself after the first life of life), there is an indication for use when in anamnese a hyperammonary encephalopathy consists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are not able to swallow tablets or for patients with slip disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granulatform.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated by taking up the patient intolerance and the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium polyriumphenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">In patients suffering from an early maniac lack of carbylphosphatase or ornithintranscarbylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosappuccinase deficiency need arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0,7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with loopsy, as there is a risk to the emergence of eyelash hoop if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyyrian, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be applied in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium insufficiency and estrogen levels.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium polyurethral about the liver and the kidneys take place, AMMONAPS in patients with liver or kidney failure should only be applied with extreme caution.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous rabe of phenylacetate at young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) it came to a slowdown of neural multiplication and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">It also found a delayed maturation of crumbling synapses and a diminished number of functioning neurons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be noted whether phenylacetate is eliminated in humans into the mother's milk, and for that reason the use of AMMONAPS during the lactation period is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients stood at least one undesirable event (AE) to and at 78% of those undesirable events that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old heroic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactose, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose appeared at a 5 month old small child with a longed single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go with the accumulation of phenylacetate, shown at a intravenous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day a dosisunlimited neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound connected by acetamine to phenylacetylglutamine conjuamine that is eliminated by the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram Natriumphenylbutyat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is placed at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical result.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early maniac form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in the new-born age was earlier almost always infant, and the disease itself led to death with peritonealdialysis and essential amino acids or with their stickers-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By houralysis, the use of alternative ways of nitric excrease (sodium and sodium acetate), proteinbenzoat and Natriumphenylacetate), proteinbenzene and sodium amino acids, it was possible to diagnose the survival rates of newborn in postpartal (however within the first lifetime) of diagnosed disorders to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease has been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of a hyperammony encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it came with the time of many too mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late maniac form of the disease (including soft patients with the heterozygoten form of ornithintranscarbylase defect), which were treated by a hyperammony encephalopathy and subsequently treated permanently with sodium and protracted diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized in liver and Niere enzymatic with glutamine conjuly, with phenylacetylglutamine arises.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle, of hemostasis and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (not controlled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients according to intravenous matism from sodium polyyrian (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g Natriumphenylbutyat in tablet form were determined 15 minutes after ingesting measurable plasma concentration of phenylbutyrat.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cells or hemogloyopathies (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), no phenylacetate in plasma was verifiable in the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis that were repeatedly treated with sodium polyybutyat (20 g / day oral in three single cells), the middle phenylacetatkonzentrations in the plasma-wind-organ were scored on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The drug is eliminated within 24 hours approximately 80 - 100% in the form of the conjuated product phenylacetylglutamine on the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus testing, Natriumphenylbutat was treated with toxic and non-toxic effects (study 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS Granules is taken either oral (infants and children who can not swallow no tablets or patients with loopsy) or over a Gastrostomieschlauch or a nasal sonde.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose sodium polyriumphenylbutyat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteine in plasma should be held within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">In patients suffering from an early maniac lack of carbylphosphatase or ornithintranscarbylase, the substitution of Citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granules contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram Natriumphenylbutyat, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium polyyrian, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rats were exposed before the birth phenylacetate (active metaboite of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the brain-cows.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old heroic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactose, severe hypokalemia, panzytopenie, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stöchiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine with urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); Phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urinary cycle can be assumed that for each gram Natriumphenylbutyat between 0,12 and 0,15 g phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen can be produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are also hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of neurological condition can occur.</seg>

<seg id="2861">During the duration of durability, the patient can save the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the middle measurement of the 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium polytumphenylbutyat.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to get the medication about a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water (solubility of sodium polyyrian is up to 5 g in 10 ml water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In people with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they can not be able to withdraw from proteins in the body after consumption of proteins.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is applied for the treatment of adult patients with "acute caronarsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood sugar to the heart), for example in instabiler Angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardium (heart attack) without "ST- Hebung" (an anomalous measurement of electrocardiogram or EKG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">Becomes angiox for preventing blood clots in patients applied to a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help with patients with Angina or heart attack for the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients attended the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in allsome gift, or in combination with a glycopic inhibitor (GPI, a different drug to prevent clots with Heparin (another anticoagulans) and a GPI was compared.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient frequently became a stent (a short tubes that remains in the artery to prevent a loss), and they received additionally other medicines to prevent clots, such as Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in preventing new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year altogether as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who subjected to a PCI, angiox in regards to all indicators just as effective as Heparin, except in heavy blood pressure, in which it was considerably more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be applied in patients who may be insensitive (allergic) against Bivalirudine, other hirudine, or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It should also not be applied in patients who had recently had a blood pressure, as well as with people with strong hypertension or severe kidney problems or a reduction problem.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Humanity Committee (CHMP) came to the conclusion that Angiox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a removable replacement for heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2889">September 2004, the European Commission granted the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd received an approval for the marketing of angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronarsyndromes (instabile Angina / non-ST-leverage) (IA / NSTEMI) in an emergency and if an early intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended Initials dose of angiox in patients with ACS is a intravenous bolting of 0,1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">In the case with the patient a PCI is carried out, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be raised and the infusion should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">After the PCI, the reduced infusion dosage can be recorded by 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, a bolting of 0.5 mg / kg is administered, followed by an infusion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioxes in patients with a PCI is made up of a initial intravenous form of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and effectiveness of a single bolus-gift of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value is shortened by 0,3 mg / kg / body weight, this value should be shortened by 0,3 mg / kg / body weight.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituent and thinner medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bolusdosis quickly failed intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds, a further monitoring is no longer required, provided that 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney type (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which is subjected to a PCI (whether with Bivalirudine against ACS or not), a lower inflation rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is under 225 seconds, a second Bolusdosis is to be held from 0,3 mg / kg and reconfirm the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bolusdosis.</seg>

<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking Warfarin and treated with Bivalirudine, should consider a monitoring of the INR value (International Standards ratios) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bivalirudin was once again achieved the level of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Departing from the knowledge of the effect mechanism of anti-coagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytic or Thrombocytenshemmer) can be assumed that these substances raise the bleeding danger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of Bivalirudine with Thrombogenic aggregationshemmern or anti-coagulants are the clinical and biological hereof parameters to control in any case regularly.</seg>

<seg id="2914">Heavy blood measurements were defined according to the ACUITY and TIMI scales for heavy bleeding, as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and serious bleeding occurred at Bivalirudine alone significantly less often than in groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intractive, inperitoneal, intraocular blood cells or bleeding in the punctuation point, reduction of the hemostal levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood-level, reoperation due to a bleeding, application of blood products to transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less often observed bleeding localisations, which occur at more than 0.1% (occasionally), "other" punctuation, retroperitoneal, gastropod, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bivalirudine at 6000 patients, which subjected to a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudine group and in those with heparin-treated comparative groups, women and patients over 65 were more common to undesirable events as in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred at Bivalirudine significantly less often than in the comparative-group on Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIA-Inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Following side effects which are not listed above have been reported after extensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organs ordered in table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdose the treatment with Bivalirudine will immediately break down and the patient engmaschige with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains Bivalirudine, a direct and specific Thrombinder inhibitor, which binds both the catalytic center and the animalpond region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether Thrombine is tied in the liquid stage or to Gerinnsel.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The bond of Bivalirudine at Thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible because Thrombon is slowly splitting the bond of Bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 slowly, thus enabling the function of the active center of Thrombin regenerates.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, through Bivalirudine with Serum of patients, in which it had come in the past to heparked Thrombosis Syndrome (HIT / HITTS), was not inducing a Thrombogenic aggregated reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">With healthy volunteers and in patients Bivalirudin shows a dosis- and concentric-dependent anticoagulant effect, which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT, QPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If the patients were executed a PCI-randomly, an additional bolt from 0,5mg / kg Bivalirudine should be increased and the infusion should be increased to the duration of the entry to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, non-fractionated Heparin or Enoxapartheid was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronation (ACS) in patients with instabiler Angina / non-ST-leverage attack (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to get a GPIIb / IIIA Inhibitor either before the outbreak of the angiography (at the time of the Randomisation) or at PCI.</seg>

<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacoinetic properties of Bivalirudine were evaluated in patients who subjected to a percutaneous coronary artery (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudine as Peptid has a catabolism in its amino acid components using the subsequent revaluation of the amino acids in the body-pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metaboite, which results from the split of the Arg3-Pro4 bond of the N-season sequence through Thrombin, is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal kidney function following a process of initial half-time period from 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, young people and children over six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm injected or as a permanent infusion with a insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce sufficient insulin in regulating the glucose level (sugar) in blood or that insulin is not used effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin is very negligible to humanity, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter work time than a short-effective humanist.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type-2 diabetes in which the body insulin is not effective, Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indication for the effectiveness was the change in concentration of substance glycosylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type-1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.2% to 7.46%) compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin per year.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type-2 diabetes the reduction of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% at human normal level.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be applied in patients who may possibly be supersensitively (allergic) against insulin or any of the other components, or in patients suffering from hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to distribute Apidra to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is referred to as subcutaneous injecting either in the part of the stomach-blanket or the delusion or subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal box.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the decreased glucose capacity and diminished insulin pump, insulin can be demoted in patients with a limitation of liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of the active force, the mark (origin), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinkdelayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 A insufficient dosage or the demolition of treatment, especially in patients with an insulator medication, can lead to a hyperglycaemia and an diabetic cletoazitiary; these states are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing one patient to another insulin or insulin is required to take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change in switching the treatment schemas.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Among the substances that can enhance the bloodsugar levels and increase the inclination to hypoglyceman enzymes, angiotensin-Converting, fluoxetine, fibrous, pentoxidiyllin, propoxyph, salizlate and sulphamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympatholytics such as beta-lockers, Clonidine, guididine and reserpine, can be toned or absent the symptoms of the adrenergen counter-regulation.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimentation studies revealed no differences between Insu- linglulisin and Humanity in terms of pregnancy, the embryo / fetal development, the birth or post-natal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery enters into human mother's milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor will it resorbed to oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the types of clinical trials published by those undesirable pharmaceutical restrictions, grouped according to system organs and ordered by decreasing the incidence of their occurrence (very frequently: ≥ 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; rare, &lt; 1 / 10,000); not known (incidence on basis of the availability of data does not be underestimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold, cool, cool and blender skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, concentration disorders, benomeness, predominant hun-, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and heart knock.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy is missed to change the injecting site inside the injection unit, can occur in the episode a lipodystrophy on the injecting site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Serious hypoglycaembodies with consciinsomnia can be treated by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glukagon (0.5-1 mg), treated by a given person, or treated by a doctor of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">According to a glucose injecting, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine or cause of the heavy hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers the blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially by skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutters croube of insulin delivery occurs faster and the time duration is shorter than with hu- manly normal.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male persons at the age of 21 to 50 years with type-1-diabetes mellow insulin pump showed 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg a disproportionate increase in gluing gluing effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase of gluing effect, just like Humanism.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisine has an twice as fast activity as a normal human impact and achieves the complete gluing effect of about 2 hours earlier than Humanity.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was clear that in an application of insulin louliswithin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable ic glycaemic control is reached, as is made with human subjects, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Was insulin lobulation in 2 minutes before the meal, has been achieved a better, efficient control than with human subjects, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Insulin is used in 15 minutes after the meal commenced at the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycemic control as in human standard, which is given 2 mixes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin insulin at Gabe 2 minutes (GLULISIN - previously) before the start of the meal in comparison to human standard, which was given 30 minutes (normal - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A), as well as compared to human standard, which was given 2 minutes (normal - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
