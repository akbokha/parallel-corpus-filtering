the package &amp; package , includes different modules for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they provide some additional features and simplify the use of some features by &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; by which these are easier available .
for more information about the use of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules at &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; download settings extension .... open the card card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of default settings from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have added additional software .
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click on the Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or the list of stor@@ my , if available , delete .
the module address filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in der &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ termin@@ ations . with the module you can filter &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M Bau@@ man@@ tra at &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; thus open the DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as a default , the ad starts with the root element of the document , for example : the element , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this root .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; a further view for objects with the M@@ IME Type in@@ ode / Directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbolic and text views , so that you can view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ yed folder @-@ hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map graphi@@ cally . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess the sum of sizes of sub@@ ordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at a FS@@ View ; it reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries . accordingly , large files can be easily detected at the folder hierarchy . accordingly , it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the map @-@ map representation of a rect@@ angle that represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the justification have a meaningful color for color monitoring and marking settings .
the colour of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on view color mode , can be either depth to the slight detection of the he@@ aters or representation of a different file , such as name , owner , group or m@@ ime @-@ type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each feature , you can determine if sufficient space to display is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordinate rect@@ angle is to occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle .
in display algorithms for tre@@ ads , the rule should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ emap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this purpose will not always be observed . if you need space , then the sub@@ ordinate entries are no longer available . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
as for the distribution of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation remains left . here it is for the prot@@ esting and to avoid space losses by means of always beneficial the areas that are as square . the best methods on this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive cap@@ tions .
you can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a rob@@ bery @-@ pattern is drawn into the area of the sub@@ ordinate entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , which was developed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras , ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&amp; management came ; contains a quick image processing with base imaging tools . you can use these to review your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the handling capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE image plug @-@ ins ( manual ) modules easily .
although &amp; management came ; easy to use it , it makes d@@ ashing professional skills available . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw materials using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ export and ICC paint @-@ administration work@@ flow .
improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as a win , over the camera or the lens , which can be searched for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; management came ; an open source project . that means , it is aimed at supporting the end users . they should therefore report issues and improvement possibilities .
&amp; As is coming , the det@@ aching of problems or correction is made as easy as possible for them . wherever you use these links , your web browser open a page in the error report . all required information is already registered here . follow the instructions to post your report .
&amp; As came , is a project that is supported by a community . that means , users and developers come together with each other . if you want to enter a regular user of &amp; claim ; however , we would like to answer any questions of other users here . however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list is spoken English , you should this language be powerful .
you can also visit the publication ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; management came here .
the best start to get involved , is the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to the sign in the developer mailing list from &amp; management came ; .
once you start off , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . here , you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . just enter or click the folder icon Fol@@ der symbol to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the Dat@@ ab@@ n@@ k file will be stored . this path is equal for all folders .
later you can add as many folder as you would like to add . as a download , you can additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings as set up collections .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images lists , as base folders . no picture is changed . during the trans@@ cription of the folder you will get a progress show like this :
&amp; As came , dur@@ st seeks recur@@ sively the reference ad in all its depth . you cannot shut any sub@@ folder , unless it is a box in hidden folder . you can do the exceptional folder . do it done by insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list do not take photos as symbols . you can change the photo by clicking on the folder symbol . this will then be used as an album symbol . further details can be found in the section albums .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; download ; your digital camera set up . afterwards you should learn how to use My albums and My sampling list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw material support : if you use the raw @-@ mode of your camera , it may well deal with it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ ing@@ era@@ support .
how you setup this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h decoder and ro@@ h work@@ flow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera position is available to you so that you can connect with your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; desk ; of course , more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader who is supported by your operating system , with &amp; management came together .
modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&amp; As came , the program g@@ photo@@ 2 is used to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , further separable protocol created by over 800 cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras and other peri@@ pher@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general large files are outdated and transmission through serial port , this connection is meanwhile outdated . &amp; management came , supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ bex@@ able support so that the EX@@ IF support is required by some li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to take pictures or the production could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; desk has arrived , how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the KDE image plug@@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to developing a joint module structure for &amp; management ; , C@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ gs and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is to make it significantly easier , &amp; as it came ; by writing a small module to supplement a function as the changes made in &amp; download ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
the drag and copy of pictures works anywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree , through the horizontal separ@@ ating line or to another application window . the only constra@@ int is that one image does not apply in keywords , date List or Search .
- a dat@@ at@@ ype , allows you to gau@@ ge the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields , which are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . this way the fil@@ tering is displayed on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if this ind is displayed in symbol@@ ism . which fields can be shown in the dialog of the settings .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo@@ sets . these albums are stored in a single album tree ; these albums are sorted by the folder , according to the name of their collection in the properties tab or after the date when the album was created first , the date can be changed in the properties of the album .

the buttons oldest , average , newest : they put the date on the one of the oldest , the latest image or the passage of the album . first , first tries to calculate the average of the images from its EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the final change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first came to an album in the album , the first image is being presented as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; chosen . this is meant to help you remember the photos on the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to choose another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and click in the context menu &amp; quot ; in addition , you can select the photo on the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included in one collection and collections can not be vei@@ led .
&amp; checking came ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the area My sampling list left in the main window . album collections have another effect . in the collection always include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the picture window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview window , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two Lup@@ en@@ cla@@ p in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album the first time , you must wait just to be generated while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this allows you to avoid in which you re@@ generate in the menu ex@@ tras .
information to each picture are shown below the thumb@@ nail preview . which information this is , you can change over settings ; set up here the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have assistance windows , the f@@ d. if you can rest the mouse @-@ cursor a moment over a picture . the scre@@ enshot shows the most important features including all the cat@@ al@@ ic@@ ity of a photo . the scre@@ enshot is shown in the main window lists in the main window shows such a Help window .

you should note that after the processing of other image processing programs can occur with the met@@ adata changes . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , lightning , etc .
&amp; As , there are two options for rotating . the easiest solution is to click on the thumb@@ nails and select them . in the sub@@ menu , you can indicate the degree of rotation .
to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . please note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; claim ; delete , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; shifted . F@@ 8 picture Dele@@ te or Ent@@ f Falls you would rather want to delete , you can use this by using Shift ; f .
the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ ums@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organiz@@ es your photos by the data . &amp; management came ; used for either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last change in the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month in the picture view are shown . you can choose days or weeks in the date of the dates below , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
photos with keywords will provide a flexible and powerful opportunity to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers to be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this sample or search .
if a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word displayed .

this rider provides an intuitive map material based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . obviously , this requires ahead of your pictures Geo @-@ data included .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your Geo @-@ filters . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . he works like a live Geo@@ folder .
&amp; As came ; sets a bul@@ b in a separate window , with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported pic@@ data formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more pictures from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em is added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated menu and opened his window . if you are back in the screen ; main window , you can open the bul@@ b quickly with L Extras .
from the preview , you can choose the images you want to compare to the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard it . a small arrow displays you to what copy is displayed in the window area . if you can preview synchron@@ ise the tool@@ bar and execute the Zoo or different configurations on one of the pictures , then these can compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to select fast from a picture series . if you navigate in pairs out of the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the fields . the right next picture is displayed in the right area . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar pictures to work through .
of course , the normal sol@@ vers are also working directly from the illuminated field , e.g. F@@ 4 file Be@@ work ....
all images from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the bul@@ b . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swing function , which you swing to the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode , then both show pictures the same picture area .
the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the z@@ oom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse @-@ wheel to get into the image and out into zo@@ oming . this happens in both images if you are preview in the mode .
what is a digital survey - away from the fashion company ? digital invent@@ ories looks every part of the process that has been taken up to the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital invent@@ ories through . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to use your pictures , protect and use photos . we consider the procedure to ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group@@ ed , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , maintain , and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory administration takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , secur@@ es , trans@@ forms , trans@@ forms , trans@@ duc@@ tive and exported content containing a monetary or cultural value .
met@@ adata are defined as data relating to data . met@@ adata are provided in accordance with your definition , the information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I dare to claim if you have more than 1,000 photos on your computer , then you don &apos;t even need to find out how many photos you have , then you definitely use it and deleted . . the approach to store the met@@ adata both in a database and in the image files , you can access very fast seeking and secure archiving on which you can freely access by other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you do and need to know before doing anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide whether other access to your photos may be stored , whether you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . please note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location . the remaining photos are organized in one year several times the same place . the remaining photos will be organized using your date . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use is a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , working courses , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % of the archives and 5 % of work files will not be created and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for these contents .
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acker processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the split of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend the option Met@@ adata to store in the site of the met@@ adata and checking it . this makes sure that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which change ? to do this , &amp; order came ; give them a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now , the real work begins , as you now need to assign any picture keywords , marking and rating . of course , you can select all the pictures , who need the same attribute and then set the value . it makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos .
let &apos;s now leave us with keywords , keywords , as you are frequently called hot , or categories on other programs . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then it &apos;s going to insert the tree for you . the converting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by applying a sub@@ tree to another . the modified keywords are monitored by &amp; digi@@ tised ; updated while there are the sub @-@ trees .
the graphic shows how different met@@ adata changes . this is a very large representation , since each block of met@@ adata in truth is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates of all images .
enough the keywords - the next section refers to sign@@ posts or comments , the third important tool to catalo@@ gu@@ ze your met@@ adata .
you want to not only see your photos with your friends , they want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it near@@ er , then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Norman@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! one starts to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you might even listen to the silence . so the cap@@ tion has completely changed your perception of this panor@@ amas .
for others watching your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . remember , the key is the meaning to the viewer to help Him talk about the motif you move has to understand what you understand .
it is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with a digi@@ tised , you can use any number of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , then those marking can also be exported to your wishes into the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the Web Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . you have to tell the story for the opening hours a second time .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? she was not a boring planet before Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already starts with light speed .
the possibilities of ge@@ olo@@ uring are already inn@@ umerable and will be more increasing in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can start your travels virtual . this then shows the photos at the reception . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the google@@ maps .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and identifies the practice to remove copyright restrictions to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all the changed versions , i.e. also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the furniture page from &amp; radio came ; as information you should be depos@@ ited :
the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used again . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author name ) : associated with the author . examples might be the work designation of the photographer . examples for this may be the photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , this has to be filled out .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily need to be the author . if the photographer does for a news agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then here the group / agency that offers the image here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright section , although this has no protection against abuse . each of which has no protection against abuse . each of which has a little bit more than basic met@@ adata , clear or change . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important to them .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; management came , will present such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .

of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the road or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen on traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are talking about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TR@@ ACK , the largest data exchange company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes loss of data .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these are more cautious and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in filing quality , which are more difficult to obtain and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself . whether you believe it is in your measurable room .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ read@@ able , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good reception devices and use them in the right way . the best DVD recep@@ tions are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable . so it turns to select the right .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to error , even if you have just been written . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect oneself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for the format@@ ting and control procedures . despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called iso@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracle in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is also not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications which damaged data from damaged flo@@ ppies , hard@@ disks , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to store the For@@ mat@@ orium against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost sixty @-@ layer the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . all that is said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu @-@ ray disk .
burn slowly with a good reception device on high quality media in a non @-@ quality media . read then the media with a description , date &amp; author markers and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected place . do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk @-@ manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing cranes include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ crete study
soon : Dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ate range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . at lower temperatures , this error increases . some of SM@@ ART fixed errors are reported immediately after exp@@ ir@@ ation . these are particularly read@@ sheets and de@@ priv@@ ation count . the expected life @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years .
this is a question of the loss of loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a black@@ out before you backed the files , but these losses normally leave without major problems .
while most electrical devices do not account a lot , the device looks different with devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed proc@@ ess@@ ays . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause severe damage , hardware replacement , destroyed mother@@ boards , and other defects . protect yourself from the un@@ avoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against black@@ heads is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absorbed a part of the energy @-@ heat and the rest finds . it is usually available in the form of a st@@ ec@@ ker@@ board . however , remember that not every tri@@ ec@@ ker@@ board also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against flash supplement and thus protects the proper devices .
as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should be aware that also all peri@@ pher@@ als that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers make over@@ voltage protective sli@@ ders which also contain a telephone line for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of cable mo@@ de@@ ms and television programs .
if you have an emergency , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks which are very small and you also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects from smaller variations into the power lines , it will not really help you in a full cut out . even an emergency of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in a non @-@ stop power supply .
apart from the protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a power cut comes . this gives you the possibility to store your data and then run the system . if you buy a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the time of battery and the attached software is interesting .
check out the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security in electricity defects with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be saved for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind how well your machine is protected with it . at the end , you should remember all the cables to be separated before you go into the holidays .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration , you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data .
in comparison to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet .
the solutions are suited only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important ones . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not find your images in full resolution online . the professional version provides you with unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality only .
from the point of view of the data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically sc@@ aled thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included a backup and distribution memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ased .
the diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the PC . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transfer error occurred , not when this happens in your computer . all these disorders remain un@@ detected until you have no protection for it . no one seems to have thought to have . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission loss because they generate interference within the data streams . at normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Mic@@ ros@@ ystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle turn@@ out at low levels and can be scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one of the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is available soon also for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mach@@ in@@ eries and is also available for &amp; Linux . but it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the losses in the notebook and 46 % for working systems . at not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft already amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than the seas . it leads to a lower damage , as for example theft or re @-@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; for a long time no longer has been sighted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than EX@@ T@@ 3 , Ex@@ ser , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to call the common fil@@ esystem . a very good English article can be found here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . however , a file has not been completely saved before the problem came , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft , and human defects are the major causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras are in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras , and high @-@ quality op@@ tics are the optim@@ isation for compact cameras . even D@@ SLR cameras have their border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . even D@@ SLR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ api@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss . so , do not guarantee your data after a plan and test them before you do something dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of boards or the size of hard drives .
suppose you make daily your back@@ ups on an external board drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you are lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment .
a disaster suggests local and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget air@@ mail : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the complete house .
therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ sprung always means a local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a frequent reason for a loss of data , despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save the one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time .
differential : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup should be changed . creates a complete snapshot of two times : the complete backup and that of the last differential treatment .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create several moments . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made . this backup comes up to a version@@ ing system closest with the exception that is just being refused and not ongoing .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool you can easily set up on your machines . unlike the script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ cription copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh .
ensure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . every additional out@@ fertili@@ zation should be done manually , after which you have a complete review .
topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , original X@@ MP files , origin@@ ating , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ finding pictures and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature you &apos;ll have to look with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other option to be compatible with caution . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system down@@ wards . the less variations you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every@@ time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or change your file format , you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the subject area for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually getting bigger .
let &apos;s assume that you have already planning the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . in * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and transfer the onto a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected from the system , but do not attach them one .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of re@@ iron if needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software anymore you can read , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
gif is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
P@@ NG was used as an open source standard of the G@@ IF . however , it can save a lot more . it &apos;s loss @-@ free , supported X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and chro@@ mati@@ cal data for enhanced colour information , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F requires and slow adjustment . this format we would like to recommend to store your pictures .
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can store images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . however , a problem is that this format is adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open @-@ screen format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was already developed on the T@@ IF@@ F / EP format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata . the DN@@ G was already available and we hope to use the competitors of Canon and Nik@@ on .
this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata platform . , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is available with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive their intake , mostly in the raw format , since it saves the met@@ adata seper@@ ately from the image file . therefore , you should think about problems in the link between the Met@@ adata and the image file . therefore , you should think about whether you use DN@@ G as containers and put everything there together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata standards , which is a large area of operating purposes and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera code are , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing process , you can use external programs . if you &apos;re using the pictures again with your checking , then you should add met@@ adata again . these were under circumstances cut from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then into web galleries , or add in MPEG , use in contact sheet , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to add your photos online . in the section inser@@ tion of an album you &apos;ll have a description of how you can have photos , which you already have on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import@@ ing images to your Al@@ ben@@ database available .
to use your digital camera with your desk , connect it to the machine , switch the camera on the display mode and switch it up . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras that can be a while . some cameras show no thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera display .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of an entry or its met@@ adata .
this dialog shows file features and the photographic information that is stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . please note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
the tab met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata side@@ bar from the main window of the screen ; or image processing . note that these met@@ adata for some digital cameras are not available .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; desk ; . downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to verify that the pictures can be downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired using the default option methods of &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you selected the photos , use the button download and then download the selected download . the button @-@ chosen is loaded until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option is new to download . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; Check . in this case , the new images have been marked with a star in the showcase . if you choose this option , of course , only the new images are downloaded .
when you download the buttons , you can download or download the selected album , a dialogue with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted . the list of existing albums is displayed , as normal folder , you can read the target album from the list and press OK .
after you selected the target album , press OK , and download it , loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once , by using the button Dele@@ te all . if you only want to delete some you , you must select them first and delete it by del@@ eting .
note that there are no possibility of recre@@ ating photos which you deleted from the camera . so the photos are not deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; therefore , they should carefully checked whether the photos were successfully deleted from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , as this is much faster .
cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually processed once the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to load the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ames .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for data @-@ based under@@ mines . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
the options , while transmission opens three more options that are done before the photos on the record are stored . the first two concern the data about the author in the section standard car identity . if you choose this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish to use another file format as the standard format , you can use for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo - % % % H : % M : % S . turn the option date &amp; time to add . for further adjustments you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the option camera file , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in large letters if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tised , is shown below the name , which the camera is available in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera display next time .
&amp; Check out ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera for the time recording , to complete automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras will provide information . in the section names Met@@ adata you can read more details , about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want the automatic rotation off , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotating in the bottom range of the window .
if your camera information about the date , where the photo was made available , you can download it ; this under@@ mine are based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section names met@@ a data you can check out what information your camera can be embedded in the photos .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , the photo shoot . the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , you need to switch this option . use the button Re@@ ference and select the option @-@ based under@@ mine at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is the button download . then select the files you can select the files you are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file containing the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the picture selection is done , asking &amp; management came ; you , where the images are to be loaded up . a folder @-@ selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to restart the high @-@ load . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that can be displayed in long@@ itude and latitude , which can be shown on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Gali@@ leo or any other system .
not only for professional photographers can make it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an aircraft to be an area by automatic up@@ take of GPS data to kar@@ to@@ gra@@ fic@@ ti@@ es. environment plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents may use this capability .
if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can start with a click of a browser which indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; contractor ; users want to send the location of the photos , or simply document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , se@@ mit@@ es and card refer@@ ences are supported . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally about the manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there are currently no camera , which has a GPS unit , but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ote@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nik@@ on D@@ SLR ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to store this data in the g@@ p@@ x format since this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , extract data from images and from the GPS and cor@@ relate it cor@@ related . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the default characters , e.g. from map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ n.@@ shows no European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; I came to give you so much control over his work flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of images . change to the Settings menu is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left @-@ hand side .
action can be selected on embedded preview or image processing . you place the default behavior of &amp; management , fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when the option was chosen for downloading from the camera type . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields .
author@@ title is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations like e.g. An@@ ke photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a further description about the author , this field must be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for supplier : use this field to display the display of the photo . this does not have to be the author if this is an image agency , such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be displayed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC fields . it is achieved that the met@@ adata are constantly included in the picture and not only came in the data base . these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; download ; imported , without having lost .
image sho@@ ft@@ ings as embedded sign@@ posts ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this syn@@ ced the comments that you add to your photos , with the images embedded in the pictures . caution : in pictures that have already been marking , these by the pictures already occurred ; over@@ ri@@ dden .
the page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window on a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information will be displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; publication came ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which data types &amp; management came ; to indicate , you can add the file expan@@ sions of this list ; Alb@@ any folders , which has no one of these extensions , ignored and deleted .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ alize right from each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; digi@@ tised , can be set on this page to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image type lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can hereby receive better results .
by default , the editing process uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full @-@ screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image editing , this picture mode can be used with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and switched off .
with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia about the near@@ ing explanation .
by setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ es@@ per@@ m for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is free .
with the adjustment of loss @-@ free JPEG @-@ 2000 files you can save loss @-@ free . even if you choose the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , Met@@ adata were not yet supported , but was in the planning process .
in the previous versions of &amp; download , the image processing was only a picture @-@ view for photos . currently it quickly develops into a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the picture editing .
the standard process is that all green pixels are identical . if you use this option on ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a weight pattern in output . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option makes the picture a little soft , but eliminated the 2@@ x@@ 2 G@@ ey@@ s with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white sli@@ pper@@ y is used in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white cover is not set . standard it is a fixed color balance , which was shot on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details into the sh@@ re@@ lights . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
the standard is the sh@@ re@@ lich@@ ter , so the parts of your camera is burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera to view the nickname . finally , use the adjustment finishes in various Ros@@ kil@@ ns . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the hair@@ dres@@ ser .
this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast sha@@ dy as green and red . &amp; as came ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green pixel and red @-@ proportions of the still not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how much colour or wh@@ ites you want .
selecting the option to re@@ construct the option you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually .
put the L@@ umin@@ ale value according to your taste . you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; claim ; image processing can be done . in order to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed more conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete image from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor , which have many cameras and is made available to a Matrix coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Color construction .
&amp; desk came , and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Vari@@ able number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces colo@@ bar@@ te@@ fac@@ te at the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color @-@ devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a coloring correction , since you are carried out during the shell .
one profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; management came ; information such as color information to be translated from a color foam in the others are thereby the colors as accurate as possible .
behaviour questions , if an image is opened in the image editing / color administration module with raw files .
color profile folder Set@@ zen the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you all save your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed while opening the raw file later .
the Color Manager view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your images are color@@ fully managed not the whole screen .
input profiles should be used to the camera writer and model that you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not contain color mapping modules at 16 bit depths . this means that you do not have to carry the paint mapping itself .
there are other options like the soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image has been given from one device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated with it . this could manually fix you instead of leaving on the graphical algorithm of your printer .
for most of the cameras , it is rather obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile expands the style for the goal : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . it is an interface which is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image considering and image editing ; many modules support that have been written to work with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can see a list of available modules . select the files you want to use , and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ hes the time between the image out@@ puts , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other inter@@ sti@@ ckers turn the met@@ adata or that are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the ad .
camera properties show on the left side of a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly , switched on and in image mode . currently there are the portals . currently here are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage .
at the lower end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) storage cameras from the camera . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , in which you specify your camera .
to use your digital camera with your desk , you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch it into the display mode .
try out if &amp; order came ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option Con@@ figuration dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; images in the du@@ st@@ bin , you can set the conversation of a photo ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . del@@ eting the pictures and dele@@ tion of an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly used , when you use the option to use the option changes in the right side@@ bar . otherwise , you need to use the changes with the button changes .
you can also set the display of the welcome screen from &amp; desk ; at starting point , this will speed up the start process from the digi@@ tised .
the setting of Bei@@ m starts to search for new photos . this prolon@@ gs the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting folder after new or deleted albums / pictures . if something was deleted from the base folder , you ask , whether it should delete it from the base .
different shades of colors can be used in &amp; digi@@ tised , to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; management ; to create , you will find more information about this tutorial .
&amp; management came ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correc@@ ting and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu , the preview and selection of the advertisements .
the editing process contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; download ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you will find in the section image editing .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , enlar@@ ging factor and the actual image size shows .
a tool@@ bar at the top of the top and below the tool@@ bar to quick access to the most frequently used functions .
the editing functions of image editing may alter your photos . however , no of the functions will change the original photo before you store the file , save file or save the tool@@ bar . note that you can restore the original shot no more as soon as you have saved the image .
so you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it by saving .
as long as you do not have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by filling out the menu file Rest@@ ore in tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since last store .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action allows you to und@@ o re@@ vert back @-@ running and re@@ inst@@ ated by selecting re@@ producing re@@ producing from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the back@@ end and make C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z for re@@ producing .
when you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; over the run@@ way or Rest@@ ore button in the tool@@ bar , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all the actions are revers@@ ed or restored .
once you start the editing process , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation apps in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu file . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will be asked if you want to store them .
you can enter the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the port .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically .
view full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ cape key . usually , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not wish , you can view this from the introduc@@ tory dialog of the screen . see this you can call the section for setting the image editing .
if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; pressure dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . whole picture pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the album Ex@@ por@@ e print assistant . if you follow the wiz@@ ard , you only need to make your choice .
the digi@@ panel arrived ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same page bar is available without the navigation device , also available in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked .
multiple clicks on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear in the edge .
in the description , you can insert or insert s@@ wis@@ s with unlimited size or insert . note : the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the sign@@ posts are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ T and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support A@@ SC@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are written random@@ ly . if you want to use the IP@@ TC description field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after having commented on it , you either use the button users or simply change the next image , the sign@@ posts are then saved .
besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also choose the met@@ adata to the files . this is always done when you choose a met@@ adata setting , which is always written in the images .
the rating evaluation shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting line . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the side@@ bar , or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the evaluation out of the side@@ bar is applied only to one image at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keywords review shows a search box to the fil@@ tering the keywords , the keywords and a comb@@ o box with the keywords previously published in this &amp; order ; session laid out keywords .
the keywords will dynam@@ ically adjusted to the search word . you can restrict the number of options in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords .
the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging of appropriate ten@@ ths in the tree . all tags of an image are stored into the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
if multiple images are selected in the main view , and you select a key@@ word in the keywords , this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , If you want to add a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section .
the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the displayed pictures displayed in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - columns , sampling , and search points . if in addition one or more sampling filters are used in the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears if you want to put the bu@@ zz@@ word .
in the top example , the main window shows the pictures on a cal@@ ender date . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no keywords , which has been selected with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word has been selected from the right key @-@ tree to the selection and sat down . a dialog asks if this key@@ word should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . you can also be deleted under settings different .
if you have a rule and created and find that it should be or should be , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and control .
( 1 ) : the entry in which the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set a search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross@@ camp at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr does not listed ? the free space is restricted to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly found it at &amp; desk ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner is a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual pictures or sc@@ anned colors . with a colorful work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print from your digital dark@@ room .
when the subject is at paint management , everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to provide for the results he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration . additionally , links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image work@@ flow meets all of the criteria listed in the work@@ flow , you don &apos;t have to worry about color administration .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ R@@ GB color foam . ( more information can be found below )
your only other shots are per email or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for all so easy , why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color managers ?
a visual example of s@@ R@@ GB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours which we can see , the fi@@ ery @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some bigger color spaces , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on information and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to illustrate my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ aum ?
yes ! whether you &apos;re working in s@@ R@@ GB colo@@ uring or not , you need to edit your monitor , since s@@ R@@ GB equ@@ ates that your ; on@@ itor on s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to either use your monitor on s@@ R@@ GB standard , a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before trying to get an additional manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , the same , automation and contrast con@@ cre@@ ased out of the menu Cre@@ ating Autom@@ atic correction automatically try to make the best of your colors . they will be experimenting with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method will scale the lumin@@ aires across the image so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible will change without its color shades . this function is often a magnet correction for images the dark or washed .
the same : this method j@@ us@@ hes the illumin@@ ance factor of the colours of the selected image , so that the H@@ isto@@ grams of the Inten@@ sity is as flat as possible . sometimes , the equivalent amount of good results in improving the contrasts of an image , sometimes it also produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful surgery which either causes miracle in a picture or it destro@@ ys .
automatic shut@@ ters : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green and blue channel . it identifies the dark and bright bor@@ der@@ tones and j@@ us@@ hes the red , green@@ - and blue channels on the complete h@@ isto@@ grams .
contrast : this method enhances the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new ji@@ b@@ ish values in between . this is only visible in sha@@ ded pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos .
the white off from &amp; desk came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
the white @-@ white correction is a bit limited because of a color tree with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can therefore view too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure function can be performed , which works in the 16 @-@ bit mode , so your ways to correction is better .
this tool is based on a white @-@ syn@@ onymous extremism that is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it above the menu @-@ entry colors white off the image processing .
the showcase can be customized in size . on the left hand side both the original image and preview of the target image . preview is dynam@@ ically adjusted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ ch@@ less then it is enough to click the window window .
the preview photos feature a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ grams .
to the right above is a H@@ isto@@ gram indicated that as soon as you change a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful because , even in well illuminated images , most pixels very small L@@ umin@@ ate values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your outcome depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and gam@@ ma . the shade of the shadow allows you to improve the shadow @-@ details of your photos or also for re@@ alising .
An@@ stat with the above controls can be done , you should use the color temperature @-@ pi@@ p@@ ette . press to this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white matter . this way also the temperature and green -@@ values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels over@@ exposed . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
the buttons are storing and loading accurately this . any attitude of the white cover you have set is allowed to save you into a text file and later load again .
the button @-@ preferences sets out all filter values again to their standard values and the associated neutral white @-@ comparison . note that also neutral settings will emerge another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the code width per color channel of the be@@ worked image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also needed for the formats of P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and DN@@ G .
this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be carried out by the sub @-@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be seen in the chapter Color Management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors sound value . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistake and you always need the same correction . in the manual to tone correc@@ tions , you will find more information .
a very powerful option of correc@@ ting problems is to correct the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the download effects ; tool f@@ use effects will provide you with four wheels , a solar effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cant@@ ons filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar thermal , even Sab@@ ati@@ er was created , an effect of the recorded photo@@ copies created by the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illum@@ ination . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar heating . at approx . 50 % intensity shows the image what chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase finally generates a negative picture that is not to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar effect . the original image is ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter is sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation effect that he has a stronger contrast @-@ effect , which makes the colors brilliant and smooth . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on the day@@ light reflecting color movie made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ vet offers very saturated color in day@@ light and high contrasts . the characteristics make him a movie by the choice for nature photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some phot@@ ographies , especially those who hardly escape landscapes are too much .
the ne@@ on@@ filter is sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ sting . the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ts . in large pictures the filter can trigger the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color counter and the lumin@@ osity of your photo . you can change the different color bases of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be satisfied in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be able to increase . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous / contrast / gam@@ ma , the tool is very complicated for improving exposure . even if the dialogue at this tool is very complicated , need for the specified application purpose only the area of the sli@@ der . concrete the three shooting below the h@@ isto@@ grams .
the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sity values , an active channel or the selected area . under the graphs are three sli@@ der into the inside , and which can be moved to change the intention of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to postp@@ one the regul@@ ator and to look at it as the picture changes .
on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this comb@@ o can be set whether the h@@ isto@@ grams is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera , linear representation is commonly dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ istical H@@ isto@@ grams will be useful by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic organization is useful .
three regul@@ ator : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright notes , and the lowest for the middle notes , often called Gam@@ ma@@ .org .
the three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the cause of the shadow , middle and bright notes automatically . furthermore , there is a button for full automatic adjustment .
pay@@ outs include the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators that can be used to change the inter@@ mitt@@ ent inter@@ active as for the intervention . for example , the compression of the ga@@ stri@@ c can be used for example to create a hidden image as a background while something else is to be seen in the background .
automatically : with this button , the image values will automatically be placed depending on the intensity of the image .
save as and store : with these buttons , the displayed values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded on it . in addition , the Gimp levels will be used .
if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ alle@@ ts , the input data is automatically diff@@ used for all shadows , means and solar moisture . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the use of the H@@ isto@@ gram@@ ms for rot@@ ary , green@@ - , blue and the lumin@@ ous channels .
the option over@@ bel@@ ating indicator control controls all color channels to see above @-@ coated pixels and show you the combined results of all channels . this is a indication that you only see the effect displayed in the preview and it &apos;s not a result in the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red , green and blue channel of an photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the ex@@ termin@@ ations are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original is displayed as well as the target image . preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available :
modi@@ fying channel : this sel@@ box allows to specify the channel that is altered by the module :
beside this cas@@ ket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera , linear mode is most sensual . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode generates .
for example , if you turn a spa rope to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones with darker exhau@@ sts are corresponding and that the associated pixel @-@ pixel will be darker .
shown on the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it down and down until the value is credited to your taste .
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each bend that you have created can hereby be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded on . the file format is Gimp is the Gimp format .
when you use this method and the three colours buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , central and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green@@ - , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the option over@@ loaded simult@@ an@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined end result . this is what you see the effect only displayed in the preview and it &apos;s not a result in the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun @-@ le@@ aning was placed with the color pi@@ qu@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel @-@ bl@@ ender of the &amp; management came ; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel @-@ bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel elec@@ tor you can select the color for the h@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first note as you can fix the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left side of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to its own rider .
the display of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram to show you the appropriate color value .
the controls for the module are to the right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix the overall brightness . this is particularly convenient when you also use the appropriate color components . this is particularly convenient when you can also use the appropriate color component . try the green canal for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green canal for black @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom , leads the reduction of a color to a visible smoking , which occurs from small predat@@ ors who appear not at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern look different in every channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion to which you reduce the colour space first .
storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er settings allows you to save for later and then load . the used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel bl@@ ender format .
the option over@@ bel@@ ating indicator control controls all color channels to see above @-@ coated pixels and show you the combined results of all channels . this is a indication that you only see the effect displayed in the preview and it &apos;s not a result in the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is newly built . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and the original image is under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstr@@ action . with the development of digital photography , black / white a working step , as color pictures can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ roll@@ ers .
Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford , 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
green filters : sim@@ ulates a black / white film object with a green lime filter . this looks good at all the scene images and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Green filter .
orange fil@@ tered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a orange l@@ ind@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . so similar to 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered .
rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film object with a red len@@ tic@@ ular filter . this creates a dramatic impact @-@ effects and can sim@@ ulate any mo@@ on@@ ations for day @-@ time . so much like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film object with a yellow Lin@@ sen@@ filter . this is the most natural shade @-@ correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Gel@@ t@@ filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : creates warm bright and middle notes while he adds a bit of cold in the sl@@ ums and re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ ph@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the digi@@ ti@@ as ; tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to an image .
by adding a texture to your image , no matter if it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the thrust of an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall . the menu entry image texture can be used for this .
Rel@@ ief : postp@@ one this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth and the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture in the picture .
a paper text effect has been applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and it changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the digi@@ tised , tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image .
keeping the eye of a spect@@ ator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ atter@@ ing eye . under picture frame the module can be started out of image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired folding type for your image . going through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , abbrevi@@ ated it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal is for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the range for width varies from 1 % to 50 % .
that with the frame image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for print the images , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this practical tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture in any position . this will also work in multiple places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text excerpt , orientation , color from the color foam and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the larger the picture , the larger the character set must be . to conclude , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ sighted background .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; after the picture was saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed .
with the creator ; tool sten@@ cil uses you to put a template on one image .
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one apply in the editing process can be used to put s@@ abl@@ ons over an image .
for the sten@@ cil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should be associated with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of file size . if you want to add your sten@@ cil files , send an e @-@ mail in English to the files ; mail@@ ing@@ list , came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set up your template folder with the button basis folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings are noted for the next start .
after the root folder set for the sten@@ cils , a construction view , which reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils automatically .
under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your picture .
enlarge : this kno@@ b is enlarged the underlying picture . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
down@@ size : this button shr@@ inks the underlying picture . if you want to apply the template to the full picture , you need to shr@@ ink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
OK , if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be adapted to the thumb@@ nails .
&amp; As came , three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
shar@@ pen@@ ed is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark fields , cal@@ am@@ antine images .
un@@ shar@@ fe mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ ars and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation .
photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the dig@@ itali@@ zation process colors put together with minimal differences to a colour point . this in turn leads to a bit blur@@ red edges with just minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more subsequently shar@@ pen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG @-@ pictures often a camera has been applied internally . images in the rough format , on the other hand , must always be lubric@@ ated in during processing .
some sc@@ anners have a shar@@ pen@@ ed filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable this , you get control over your image .
in some situations you can get beneficial results by having a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ed value . you can also call it with the menu entry .
however , you should avoid caution because the results are not very natural : the shar@@ pen@@ ed increases the edge of the edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the most useful technique for shar@@ pen@@ ing an image is the tool re@@ focus . you can find further more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ y . the solution to draw the image a little soft , is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft@@ sign with the menu entry . use the thumb@@ nail on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove vei@@ ls from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the showcase clearly shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two major parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often create good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or the amount will enhance the effect . if you make the im@@ pending mask to strong , smokers and the impression of gr@@ ats close by sharp edges are creating .
the radius is just how many pixels on each page are affected by the filter . high resolution images allow greater radi@@ ators . they should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed .
the swelling is a breach of the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference differential . one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a se@@ te of filters . in this way areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of shar@@ pen@@ alties and therefore beauty defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces .
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ ell@@ value = 0.@@ 0 .
the management came ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focusing an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted Open @-@ Filter algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to create an image &amp; quot ; it &apos;s a better approach than just trying to raise the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . re@@ focus is usually achieved better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by using colors re@@ focus in the image processing .
in practice the circular F@@ altung works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel , which depends far from the original @-@ source pixels . however , the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse the gau@@ zes folding cart@@ els is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel . it causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the main parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value should put 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very un@@ sharp , but then note on hal@@ ves .
correlation : increasing the correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; g ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
smoking filters : an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.@@ 1 is rarely helpful . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; win ; 0 the image quality is very poor . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be added to the image even further .
gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a value equal to zero , you might also have to raise the correlation and / o@@ der@@ the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of Transform@@ ation@@ sm@@ at@@ rix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you choose big values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gau@@ ge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 .
storing and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any any re@@ focus parameters you have set will be stored for later and can be loaded then .
try all the cutting , color and intensity structures on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but which left untreated arti@@ facts .
if you want to read images and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module onto the un@@ compressed image .
generally produces un@@ sharp mas@@ king produce better results as raising . this could be caused to be the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood as acu@@ ity .
theoretically , it has to be cris@@ p . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter . virtually the result of the F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ ters is at least as good as the im@@ pending mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better in handling small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different fil@@ tering , on a small and focused picture :
the original un@@ sharp color image has to be corrected . this picture was taken with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus lenses .
for more information about the methods of shar@@ pen@@ ing in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the regul@@ ator G@@ wel@@ s puts the un@@ sharp@@ ness of the zone that has been obs@@ cured in order to generate a natural P@@ up@@ ille .
the color tin@@ ts allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want to use blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with un@@ parall@@ eled speed .
the algorithm algorithm was developed by IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to fin@@ alize the filter settings , you can use the horse@@ men smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail post@@ ure &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an equ@@ itable smoo@@ thing over the image . wei@@ ghed upon bigger values , mainly homo@@ geneous regions , and details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details so that no shar@@ pen@@ ed protection should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . please note that the details of the details always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated .
direction addic@@ tions Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie c@@ asses , or C@@ CD smoke will create a high value wav@@ e@@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best viewed with a value close to 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum value factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is done , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ b effect , it must be higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually , here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ wide as &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha small is chosen , should be small as well . be sure that small angles should produce a long term . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral part &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de @-@ wide into pixel . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the More Quality that you get through the choice of this option is only small , but it doubles its running time . therefore we recommend it to allow him out .
the buttons are storing and loading accurately this . any setting of image errors can hereby be saved into a text file and can be loaded again later .
image errors is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take a very long time and a high CPU load to move . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash .
below you can see how picture error was taken with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied in a photo that in Guatemala city was done with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you see there is a peculiar black ar@@ te@@ facts in the foreground , that caused by a bad film storage during the trip , the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tis@@ ation came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filter to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor from the camera or mo@@ ist ; -@@ effects from sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need further information on sensor@@ ic cameras of digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial .
the scre@@ enshot shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bas@@ al noise which can be successfully removed from this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you will only need the sub@@ window details and the program &apos;s advanced settings may remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is required per pixel and can cut the image through the radius and the color in it is smooth and thus har@@ assed minor bugs .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pix@@ el@@ ab@@ ut to determine the lumin@@ ance alter@@ ations . if it is raised , smoke det@@ ective . you need to change the edges filter at the front . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer get and det@@ ach or lubric@@ ate again .
edges : controls the cant@@ onal accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot occur the total noise or smoke @-@ tips can occur . put it down to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a slim smoking or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance field of the image . we recommend you to either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the process of the board process controlled by the details configuration settings .
color : controls the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend you to either change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the process of the board process controlled by the details configuration settings .
Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the darker areas , which typically are more predat@@ ory , but it also handles the shadow areas .
absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ iness . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear to occur if it is too high , can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it .
save under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for smoking reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ y for your purpose . fortunately , the image is a little soft to draw . fortunately , you can draw a bit easier than an image . use the tool for soft@@ sign with the menu entry . use the thumb@@ nails on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the effect came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photographic work .
this filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted ar@@ te@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove the Gau@@ ß &apos;n noise , movies , compression ar@@ te@@ fac@@ te and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently dig@@ itali@@ zed images to remove . the smoo@@ thing is done along the con@@ tours and thus keeps the content as it makes the human eye .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the material composition is performed with another tool , the image error , the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ í and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compression sal@@ uted , he creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons are storing and charging exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved into a text file and be loaded again later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it may take a very long time and a high CPU load to move . hence , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
below you can reduce as a photo with like @-@ shaped noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ olta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si cam at an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with an sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious movie c@@ asses on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , textures can be reduced to an old color photograph , which was created with a scanner device . you can see the Scan @-@ arti@@ facts caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the document arrived ; tool Hot@@ pixels allows to remove hot@@ pixel of photos showing with a C@@ CD camera , eight were to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ ens .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixel are particularly high in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras are equipped with JPEG compression about a built @-@ in repression of hot pixels .
this tool can be used to delete &amp; quot ; name is pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel @-@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ screen sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wiz@@ ard with the button of the dark . the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it &apos;s important to record the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels with C@@ CD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image . an automatic processing of the dark becomes the bad pixel . please note that the assistant notice the last dark picture and that automatically loads this automatically in the next session .
the picture area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all pre@@ views .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to pol@@ lin@@ t these pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ ation : it becomes an average of the neighboring pixels . the resulting color will be assigned to all the broken pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 from the pix@@ el@@ block are set up to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default method of default . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
Kub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled up to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ test correction of a coloring photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image was enlarged on 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
for@@ win@@ der lenses , in particular the middle and large photo@@ format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sha@@ king ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by putting the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ lenses show also this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . Wi@@ win@@ der lenses should also use with Center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller since otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ ned effects are caused by motion .
with the big exposure areas of today &apos;s film and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by making an equi@@ valence transformation in a shell that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is applied to a picture . the algorithm is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by John Walker .
with three re@@ gl@@ ers you can control the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ ze filter and with three further the expos@@ ing of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light damp@@ er on the spot of the greatest density the fil@@ ters . the default density is 2.@@ 0 , which allows an optical filter with a bl@@ ending point of 1 , or random@@ ly a lumin@@ osity of 2 , sp@@ ell@@ ur@@ .@@ In@@ cre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree .
lumin@@ osity , contrast and gam@@ ma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is less@@ ening the expos@@ ing of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator will only provide positive values , as you only need to increase settings .
if you want a subtle re @-@ adju@@ sting the expos@@ ing of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gam@@ ma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the bed . image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp @-@ stronger and contrac@@ tion was also performed with the image using this tool .
the digi@@ ti@@ x came ; linear distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the effect of cel@@ estial lenses on photos . it uses a copyright algorithm of David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with ge@@ ometric distor@@ tions . colour@@ less distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second counts covers the general ge@@ ometric distor@@ tion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ cre@@ exe shape of the image .
the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar round@@ effect , fla@@ cht however on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ der corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , any ge@@ ometric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are ho@@ ver@@ ted distor@@ tion .
corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ des . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners &apos; parameters set the reverse parameters the reverse parameter .
Zoom : this value new@@ ts the size of the size and thus leads to the correction of the first Gra@@ des . negative values enlarge while positive the picture is reduced .
brigh@@ ten : this value j@@ us@@ hes the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase .
to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as standard values .
the ton@@ s. or ho@@ ver@@ ular correction should be carried out in front of all tri@@ mm@@ ers or size changes . best do this correction as all the first . if you would like to re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ical correction , the effect would be obvious to the wrin@@ kles .
to help you find the best correction to you , this tool introduces you to an important place , such as the marine edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the ton@@ s. / ho@@ ver@@ ular distor@@ tion using the help of the lines .
if you correct a ho@@ ver@@ ular distor@@ tion , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove it with the cutting tool in the Trans@@ form menu , or remove it from the image processing or through the z@@ oom re@@ els of this dialogue .
for most images the ton@@ bin@@ ical correction is made . the next logical step for some motives , frames and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective to correct that all angle in the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method of sim@@ ulating inf@@ rar@@ ed movie by the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ed movie , see this URL . this film has a awareness of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate a movie c@@ asses and sensi@@ tiveness ( ISO ) option if you want to sim@@ ulate the gran@@ ate texture of a highly sensitive movie . ISO regul@@ ator changes the quantity of the movies and the domin@@ ance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
since the filter colour channels to reproduce by inf@@ rar@@ ed film , especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color@@ binary information is missing .
this is an example of the inf@@ ra @-@ fil@@ tering effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensation of the movie was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a sort of au@@ ra in the sh@@ utter .
the digi@@ ti@@ ke came ; filter film@@ making is an easy to use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets to your images . this is known from classic high @-@ speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , to increase the sensation of the movies and the manufacturers of large silver @-@ bas@@ kets of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion .
the cinem@@ atic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life . if you want to use this specific , gallery @-@ like , street photographic view , specially in your mono@@ chro@@ ms photos , so you must use this filter .
with regul@@ ator the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be adjusted to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gran@@ ules . the default value is , although frequently higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need any more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the clo@@ ister effect on a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the bar@@ ge came ; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ tised , filter oil painting are a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for this effect .
there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the top choose the brush @-@ size between one and five out . thicker brus@@ hes are better for big images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , seen from the other side , the texture .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and that is working with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the &amp; management came ; Fil@@ ters Koh@@ le@@ drawing uses color and Inten@@ sive gra@@ dient to create a co@@ gn@@ ancy in drawing . these lines which change the outlines in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline what scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two regul@@ ator with a value @-@ range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator chooses the pin size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adapting the Inten@@ sive value still further .
the deposit came ; Filter engra@@ ving defines your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ acked in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; download came ; Fil@@ engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ oton@@ ous landscape .
the depth it allows to adjust the contrast to the fil@@ tering . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default .
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this fil@@ tering group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to the wave @-@ blocks 1 will dist@@ orts the image here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button .
with this fil@@ tering group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of im@@ shar@@ k effects . it uses copyright protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
Zoom in@@ shar@@ fe : blur@@ red the image along a star @-@ shaped lines that go from a central point . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often visible in sports photography .
radi@@ al imbalance : blur@@ red the image through rotation of the pixels to a central point . this sim@@ ulates the wr@@ apping of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal of removal : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back in the background .
movement @-@ sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this sim@@ ulates the im@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera .
soft shi@@ ms : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this produces photos with a dre@@ am@@ eric and shiny moving effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or add a warm and subtle fi@@ ref@@ usal .
ch@@ ills : blur@@ red the image through random shift of the pixels and sim@@ ulates the oun@@ ce of an arbitrary movable camera .
intelligent fil@@ tering : finds the ch@@ illing in the image and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it then , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this gives it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorithm .
dri@@ pping size allows the size of the dri@@ p to change . as the size size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the amount and density of drops . fish@@ ness changes the optical effect of drops in the picture .
you can keep an area free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es . use the tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es , the area will remain free from reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es .
this is an example of the rain drops . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the painted image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mir@@ rors or rotating in the correct orientation . you can also find the tools in the Trans@@ for@@ form menu or trans@@ forms .
photo magni@@ fied is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality .
a picture of down@@ size is simple . the big question is how can you find a picture bub@@ bles and the details sharp ? how can you invent the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes it a good work . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select trans@@ forms size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialogue is shown below .
the tool for size change a linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation method to join the pixels . if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlarge an image . &amp; management came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in rider New size and are listed below :
aspect ratio kept : if this option is activated , when entering the new size , the aspect ratio is the original image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is done , as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Gogh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ enz@@ berg &apos; , it must be higher than 3 .
buttons are storing and charging will be used exactly as a text file can be saved as text file and can be loaded again later .
photo sho@@ cks is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button .
you can see below an example of picture flas@@ hes , adding a small paint image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear adjustment En@@ lar@@ gement to compare .
the cutting of a photo is not only a common surgical procedure , but also a commonly underestimated tool to cut a picture . image processing permits it very easy . to cut a photo with the mouse , press the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , then you &apos;ll see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
if you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo is cut off . you can change the size of the box by pulling in the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle allows you to simply drag it up with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cutting @-@ section , use the button B@@ cutting button in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file to save or save file to save the photo .
in the thumb@@ nails , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue will be preserved .
in the tool After side ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format the greater value of height and width @-@ format is assigned to width .
the tool After side @-@ relationship uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you &apos;re using centimeters , ink or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialogue , two buttons exist around the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
down in the dialog , you can use the Max . relationship button to cut the range to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool After side @-@ relationship cut its settings depending on the orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are stored as default measurements displayed in the EX@@ IF tables , allowing the EX@@ IF data to reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the co @-@ operation assistance allow you to initiate help , so that you can put your images better together . these help are :
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of similarity . as the third party rule , harmon@@ ic triangles have a possibility to share a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles .
golden center : the golden middle is a division into different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the leaf blades of a sun@@ flower . it emerges in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was already used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects made the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number leads from Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where each number is after 1 equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers . the abandoned ponds is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is followed as visually harmonious .
the golden middle provides liquid aid lines when you put a picture together . these assistance will be listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ als will bring you good results for your photos closer . compared to third party rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the gaze of the spect@@ ator along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ et@@ rical visual river .
another rule is the justification of the golden spiral , even golden ri@@ angles . these justification are used to create the golden spiral . this may be a line or different objects . this something can be simply because without the eye to guide it will fulfil its task .
the golden triangles are also leading from above . their ver@@ tices are the mid@@ points of the side of the golden area . keep in mind that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equivalent to these lines to place a static object .
if you use Golden triangles to break up your frame create a effect that is called by professional photographers dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ et@@ rie . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ al reflect and tre@@ ad can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxili@@ ary lines . if you have a picture with lots of colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the Free Rot@@ ation is a tool to turn a picture to turn any angle .
if you do a photo , then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which the things turned around a angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ tised , image processing and the tool free rotation . select trans@@ forms free rotation and adjust to the target angle .
turn your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button preference , you can put the sli@@ der back to 0 degree . a preview is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
to your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after you fix it via an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now , you can fix the angle like in previous section .
once you have shot a picture you &apos;ll find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is the function trans@@ forms to use the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . select one of the following options :
the option for anti @-@ ali@@ asing is the picture a bit after the rotation . however , please note the above warning .
all the spec@@ ulative trans@@ formations are carried out around a point of view to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixel .
new height : displays the level of the new image , including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixel .
angle left above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the trans@@ former area .
angle right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the trans@@ former area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ former area .
angle right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ former area .
after the adaptation of the perspective , the image becomes a bit wasted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after leaving the perspective you will get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the image with trans@@ forms cutting out of image processing .
the tool @-@ tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal sc@@ atter@@ ing example will move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted in a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can launch this module about trans@@ forms .
use your image by using the horizontal angles and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical angle . if you press to pres@@ ets , the angles will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the preview .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line is bund@@ led . move the mouse to an important point , like e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool@@ ing tool to adjust your image .
after you have carried out the she@@ aring , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single layer , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two flo@@ cks are twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after dra@@ ining the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove this is to cut the image with trans@@ forms cutting out of image processing .
&amp; management came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images . the available formats are therefore hanging from your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ ili@@ ated . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ tised .
due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all files available on your system . however , you will always find the JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F below .
&amp; As came , only files in formats we know . this will be shown on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is shown in the list , you can change this list of file expan@@ sions , and then change it . in the section configuration , you will find more information about this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras even allow you to select the format you use . a ful@@ ler description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the use of data compression procedures to digital pictures . thereby , redund@@ ant information is reduced to that way the image data is stored in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results as JPEG on the same compression relationship . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss @-@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to find out more about the shell format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw material verter of &amp; management ; converting . in the section configuration , you will find further information about the use of modules with files .
&amp; checking came ; supports the shop of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which came in &amp; digi@@ tised . with this , you can see more than 200 raw data file formats . the table below shows a brief list of Roh@@ form@@ ates which came from &amp; Jones ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; but it &apos;s not a film processing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit films . if you click on a movie file , download &amp; download ; settings for playing movies to launch the program for play@@ back .

if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initi@@ ale contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments along with the module white .
many tools you need to download the photographic work are included ; and their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as ac@@ ut@@ ches , soft@@ ness , smoke @-@ supp@@ ress , re@@ focus , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialogue type that is applied to the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current picture . links of him allow five buttons to change the previous mode of preview . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected preview .
horizontal , without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top range shows the original and the bottom indicates the filter applied to the area below the selected preview .
vertically split . the left side shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper range shows the original and the lower the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to display trans@@ - and under@@ exposed . the colours used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture and place on the part of the image , from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your standard values . all inser@@ ts of the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photos . these data stem from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider provides an intuitive map material based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to drag a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . obviously , this requires ahead of your pictures Geo @-@ data included .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ alle@@ ts files . the application can be used to manipulate colour pal@@ et@@ ts and use and nam@@ ing colors .
the p@@ alle@@ ts files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in a dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ alle@@ ts , or search for files .
the cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by che@@ ered down in the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the cross@@ road add @-@ in C@@ ursor below the button color is inserted , the color is inserted from the paint plate at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode was written to write . this mode can you set by writing the cross@@ camp using Bei@@ m cursor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional paint name , followed by a poin@@ ter character , if a further colour is followed , can be inserted as color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then can be found in the color select on the left side .
&amp; Team@@ viewer : a KDE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ ene are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; programs to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the software author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only few functions .
the inter@@ viewer &apos;s project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; cold program .
&amp; Team@@ viewer : is a KDE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; dot ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; Team@@ viewer : displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( such that a change in grap@@ her in &amp; Kate ; the graph@@ .@@ re comp@@ uted and in &amp; graphic viewer )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; d@@ graph ; in one &amp; Kate ; -@@ component to open
download large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to present more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; Team@@ viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which sets the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph@@ ite . needed in detail :
the main window shows the opened graphs , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , when you start &amp; d@@ graph , without an argument , the tool@@ bar is only the symbol file opened and the ( blank ) list of last opened files . click on the first symbol to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the bottom scre@@ enshot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the string surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically .
use the wheel wheel ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right at pressed &amp; Alt ; key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
when the file is currently in &amp; graphic viewer , the loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the Grap@@ h is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item settings , see the menu item .
if you open a graph@@ ite outside of an ongoing &amp; d@@ graph viewer , if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph , if you want to open a new &amp; inter@@ viewer , or want to represent the lo@@ oming graph in one sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the dialog dialog .
at the program start , you can open all graphs of your final meeting again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be divided into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which should be placed on a page , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages divided graph with no head@@ line and with a different font .
the site again gives the opportunity to set the behavior if a file was altered on the hard drive , &amp; win ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or the program every time .
the page opens the possibility to set the behavior of &amp; graphic viewer . you can set a standard behavior for that case ( graphs in a new window , or set in a window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is requested .
the site administration gives the possibility to set the startup behavior of &amp; d@@ graph viewer . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine if you are asked for it afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ T ; will open up additional options :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; Lay@@ er@@ tal@@ e@@ men . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for targeted graph . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of targeted graph . the algorithm puts the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few cant@@ ons .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for odd graphs . it produces depic@@ tions of the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it is used the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm that is syn@@ onymous with statistics multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces for ung@@ eri@@ pped graphs a jumping model layout . it uses the Fru@@ it Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ tr@@ ack@@ able for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &quot; cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the k@@ not circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . he is useful for certain diagrams of poly@@ cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog , where you can indicate a layout command , which is then executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can give &amp; win ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ algorithms allow specific options , or even the graphs with a filter will change before it is drawn .
determined the type of graphs ( directed or invali@@ d ) and turns the default algorithm for the respective type to ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ pped graphs ) .
if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed , if this is necessary , otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse @-@ cursor . click with this mouse cursor to a &amp; GUI ; element to get further assistance to this item ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the source repository .
&amp; Team@@ viewer : is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special establishment is not necessary to use &amp; d@@ graph ; in the menu settings you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for character tools , the status bar , the .@@ Color palette , and the grid @-@ network in which you draw the symbol .
created a new symbol . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon will be created by a template , or whether you want to start anew .
represents the last revers@@ ed step again . if you do not have a step backwards , this function is down@@ lighted .
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that are not consistent with those of the icon set of &amp; k@@ k .
not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color on the color of a point click on which you click .
the status bar will show you the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the content of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three sides for symbols , background and tool@@ bar .
with the buttons , add ... , edit ... and Dele@@ te you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
choose Transpar@@ ent pixels to insert or lin@@ e@@ ale : or create a chess@@ board as Transpar@@ ency indicator . you can also adjust for the chess@@ board the size : the Kar@@ os on Klein , Medium and Groß as well as color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module images are available to read tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read new images from external sources and fl@@ atter@@ ing . currently , two sources can be used :
images scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface for reading images from a scanner that supports or other sources such as video streams . so this works you have to install K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
when you scan the menu entry images , a dialog you can choose between all available sources on your computer . select the source of which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
then the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default values to select your image . check out the preview and adjust your requirements to select the image . the estimated file size is displayed in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information .
note that the window will be completely displayed , because some settings will not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pushed the button down , you must wait for scan and display the window to fixing the options of the target image . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image to be stored .
screens can create you after you have selected the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot &gt; scre@@ enshot below . a window appears in which you can set up the different screens fot@@ o@@ di :
select The complete work@@ space to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program window will be selected , the re@@ traction program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be able to read the complete work space under the mouse only . if you read the complete work space , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch on other workplaces , you should select this delay high enough to navigate the time to navigate there .
after the scre@@ enshot was made , the dialog options of the target image with the options described above .

the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size will be altered as the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Gallery @-@ Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export is currently not documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ oral warning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit the GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata , and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools for images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in sp@@ her@@ ical coordination system that is used by GPS and Gali@@ leo . altitude , long@@ itude and lati@@ tu@@ dinal degrees are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data in cor@@ related you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x @-@ format@@ .@@ g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman you can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can create a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu on . the above to vision@@ ing dialog appears then . to load a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you need to upload a trace file with the GP@@ X file . this file will of course contain data on the same time as the pictures of your camera .
when the file is loaded a automatic correlation is carried out the coordinates in red . GPS trace dates are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera stays will be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the time zone . this can be done with time zone . put your camera zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera entries . lies the devi@@ ation underneath the data are assembled . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have a trace data from one place for images you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a locality in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing .
the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog &apos;s coordinates from a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo .
the loc@@ ation can also be found with the displayed map and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be switched between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities of hanging the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can choose the albums to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best internation@@ alization .
the module has four horse@@ men where the settings can be adjusted . you need to select these albums only . the albums are not selected hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the section below , the Al@@ ben@@ ding preview and the text of the HTML page will appear .
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely explic@@ able . if you then click on an image , a new page is opened in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default screen , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed
the rider &apos;s album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your related images . select a folder on which you have to have written permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ ex@@ porting , which contains everything will be created there .
if you selected the JPEG @-@ format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures .
with other color @-@ depth you can change the default colors . that of course influences the file size . all other settings are explic@@ able .
the rider preview images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album riders on the thumb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery .
a progress bar shows the user how far the action is . push to break down the process .
if the module has created the pages the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore start the programs to determine whether errors occur during the generation . the web browser will automatically end up in order to display the preview gallery . press schem@@ atic to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Illustr@@ ator is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Bild@@ chter allows him to view a selection of pictures and on them perform basic operational features such as rotation , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer is designed for quick image and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window @-@ mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in the JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is it that climb@@ s the file size , as no compression of color information takes place . for example , you can also find it at the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ oral warning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata &apos;s editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
you can copy the image from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function . this then opens the file op@@ dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after clicking on the button OK .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but do not write to any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ fier module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide .
the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , using a defined length . in between the individual images you can insert a base screen . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the slideshow .
all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the video format . additionally you can choose a background @-@ color for the slide . with this module it is possible to create a DVD / X@@ CD / SV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first choose the images to be packed into the MPEG di@@ asch@@ au . after that , you can launch the module via ex@@ tras to MPEG di@@ asch@@ au .
the pictures selected by you are in picture files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XVII CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds to display a picture . the speed of the image below is fixed , a low value creates very sudden , a high @-@ like image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . the name and path of the file you can specify under name of the MPEG file . keep it as possible as possible .
if you specify an audio file , under the name of the audio source file , it is integrated into the movie . after you adjust all settings to your wishes , you can catch a coffee with the button . depending on the speed of your machine you can now go a cup of coffee and enjoy the slide when you &apos;re back .
if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ver or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages to the right bottom of the button .
the printing assistant allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper together in standard photo@@ sets . this combined images can also be opened automatically with image processing Gimp . this is e.@@ g : useful to enhance your use or the Gimp module for direct expression .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the Head@@ lines tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original county of Him is : expect of d@@ cra@@ w not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera writer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first , select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ image kon@@ verter window will then appear in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview , you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optim@@ ise the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are used for the white @-@ white . the essential parameters such as gam@@ ma , brightness and red / blue can be ampli@@ fied . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G Con@@ version can be selected , so that you can use the contrac@@ tion information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results . the dat@@ ein@@ ame remains equal and only enlargement will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , T@@ IF@@ F , retains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free LZ@@ W compres@@ sing .
if you intend to process your pictures frequently or you later otherwise continue to use the JPEG format , as there are only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as storage format , the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adapted to your settings , you can start the conversion with the execute button . if you want to break down this process , you can use it .
the stack mode allows you to convert different images to one another . therefore , use this mode once you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image that are the best settings .
the settings available are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to re@@ write the existing file automatically . however , a preview is not available . however , the progress bar is not available at how far the conversion progress has been made .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . the following picture formats are supported :
this module can be used for ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the Star@@ number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck Package . you can shr@@ ink the image or enlarge . to this end , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 d@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
do not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
pre @-@ preparation : prepare the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , height and background colour , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the cap@@ turing images before . other images can be drawn to the list of cap@@ turing images and disc@@ ard it there .
after you have started the module the images -@@ window with the pictures selected will be displayed . you can add additional pictures on the button . for the last selected picture , a preview is shown on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag pictures on the picture list and disc@@ ard it to add a list of images to be displayed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the button below will remove images from the list of images that are selected from the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after you have selected all pictures , the button OK will open the new message to your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . here you only need to add the addresses and the operator . the pictures selected by you are already attached .
do not make sure to send too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations to the size of the e @-@ mails email . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you need to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here .
after the choice of comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail addresses .
the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the loss of free formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be modified . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG on images file format , and the original files in the JPEG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data is added to the cap@@ itali@@ zed images .
if the process is done , the window will not automatically shut@@ down so you can look at the status messages , in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button In@@ side you can sh@@ it this window ? en .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au a window appears with questions like you have shown your Sli@@ deshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image out@@ puts by OpenGL . however , you need to possess a corresponding graphic card , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow .
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an End@@ los@@ schlei@@ fe . you can do it manually with Es@@ dec .
the option images acci@@ dentally select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
under delay between pictures can be the temporary distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends presentation !
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly , in any transition between pictures you choose another effect .
during the Sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch to you .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide .
at the lower edge of the screen , you can see the current date , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ ing currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing these , please contact the mail@@ ing@@ list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ oral warning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your KDE industry surface .
once you have added your pictures and videos with notes , you can use &amp; UFO album ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image , are now in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries .
in the browser window you &apos;ll see the categories for which you have entered information when you look at your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each is described for themselves .
if you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person only the images shown on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single images .
if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view the thumb@@ nail pictures to see the images of your range .
in the picture , each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can save with &amp; cold album ; however , for each person you can have a custom image , of course also for places , keywords and other categories you have defined themselves .
to view images next to the name , select the button which you want to use right outside on tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . that &apos;s the advantage that you can see e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you have no appropriate images ) .
however , you don &apos;t have to dict@@ ate which image to be displayed for each individual person . now you can view the image editor window , as shown in the picture . here you can select the image for choosing the appropriate person . in An@@ si@@ ll Window you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thus selecting which part of the image should be displayed and cut .
if you access the entry in the main window , a dialog appears that the dialogue for fixing the image properties is very similar . this dialog you can see on the picture once again .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the sign@@ ments or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also specify a date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all the pictures for certain names as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are shown .
this is the user manual for &amp; cold album ; . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather want to try some functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; UFO album ; and take a look at the speed scre@@ ams , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; paste the demo album ; and select the demo album in the first dialog box ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry into cold album ; a number of examples will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; cold album ; try out .
if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; Bro@@ ther album ; as an associated HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; cold album ; take a look at the tim@@ eline . a picture of this list can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline may show you several different periods of time . each list then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline you can use on the following ways : you can choose the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , you &apos;ll see the first image of this date in the preview display ) and also displays the tim@@ eline always shown the current date of the currently displayed pictures , if you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button , and the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so draw the time information . if you select an area , you &apos;ll see only images of this time@@ frame . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; D@@ ing@@ album ; provide you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; cold album ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the integrated version is described in the HTML document .
before HTML @-@ pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more accurately .
first enter the title of the look and a description which is to contain the HTML file later . on cold album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; cold album ; export file is to be seen on the page page . nutritional information about export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information is displayed by the viewer also without description . please note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain view@@ points .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings options are ambiguous , which is why not specifically entered .
down on the page you can set different resolution solutions for the pictures . thus , those who have to view your website and possess a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images download , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 have .
the observer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified . so it can search your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as if he wants to see an image larger , he changes to a higher resolution .
in this setup area , you place the different folder and the URL , where your website is stored .
the best option for all your HTML files will be chosen and set a new sub@@ folder for all your HTML files .
first , you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be stored . this folder will be automatically added for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all visible for spect@@ ator . if you choose the basic folder a URL , a web browser , after the pages created , you should specify this folder . otherwise , the web browser should launch in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you created by you will not have to copy them manually . to allow the import function , see correctly , you have to specify the final target of files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are .
the setup options described above have been related to all three base folders and UR@@ Ls . in this one sub@@ folder will be set , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; D album ; come together , you might want to compile a HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already done a lot of time , the image information , persons on the pictures , recording , etc . , then you have to make this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them into your data base . the making properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in that the images themselves are stored in the file , or if the file is stored in the file , that you have all images together , and that this file can be accessed independently . the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File menu file ... or together with HTML @-@ Pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures in two ways . first , the pictures are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified in creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ Export .
in the following , dialogue for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can call on the menu file ex@@ porting .
the main option of this dialogue is whether to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you want to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Autom@@ atic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option to copy the .@@ k@@ im @-@ file &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; copy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; copy the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not profitable to comp@@ ress the files . if you like this , just select the option of export file .
the last option of this site is the maximum size size . if you want to send your friends pictures , the .@@ k@@ im file otherwise would be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file impor@@ ters ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the ex@@ porting database as described in the import .
the assistant to imports is made of four steps . first you have to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you are the category persons to the imported file person@@ er ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category needs to be imported to your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories that should be imported to imported file and which categories do not comply in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown in the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : when you see images , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at the pictures of your Italy &apos;s holiday and discover an image with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this guide you will undergo the various steps of ( 1 ) fixing the information about your images , about ( 2 ) the average and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tations .
K@@ Photo@@ album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual , it will be talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ ing@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file in the top folder of its images . this is a simple XML file which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. normal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want .
&amp; k@@ ing@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used for future Star@@ ts . if you want to read a different folder tree with pictures , you can start a different folder tree with images , you can launch a cold album with the option -@@ c . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; D album ; in the following section of the user &apos;s manual , the different settings options are explained .
on the left you will see six different symbols , with which you can access settings options and the options for the viewer . for each attitude , a detailed help is available , which you can access the F1 button and a click on the desired option .
it has been described as you can choose different properties for each image , e.g. individuals , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog , which is used to already process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a lab@@ eling and a symbol .
in the section categories , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options you can set complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , instead of explained all groups of a member .
in view the setup options available to you for fixing the members of the members . with the above listed list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; K@@ photo@@ album ; share its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ ti@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the website of Ki@@ pi .
the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; cold album ; but most modules have an aid page that you can call on the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other , it can be that the modules were tested with &amp; cold album . therefore , you should use new modules first with the demo database before calling them on your own images using the command &gt; Common &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have warned you !
the applications that use the modules across K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; cold album ; do not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; cold album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are writing their pictures in albums : this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulated for some modules the order after albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; D album .
here sim@@ ulates &amp; cold album ; the current album , which is simple in view , so all the pictures that show you the picture show at the moment .
besides the current album &amp; D album , I have to commit a list of albums . here &apos;s a list of albums , as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browser &apos;s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use for example the category individuals , will have a Common album ; so if you would have chosen persons chosen to view this module and pass this on to the module .
since some modules are compatible with &amp; cold album ; not compatible can you remove these from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded .
in the picture you can see an example of a start @-@ screen as soon as you boot &amp; cold album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other KDE application , take a look at the top of an menu tool@@ bar and a tool@@ bar . at the moment , you will not find much information about your pictures . in the section we &apos;ll see on this window , but now click on the pictures that shows you an overview with all the existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . these include information about the people who have been recorded on the picture , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures specified by certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section , be used . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewers .
in view three lists with a text box by allowing people to define places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; D album ; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea lies the moving of images within the list : if you have depicted for example a family celebration and displayed on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can make sure that the names of the names are moved up to the top that individuals find and assign .
if you prefer to list an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting after date under the list .
if you select any comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . in this case simply click on the buttons and buttons , which are located under the thumb@@ nail preview .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California .
in the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the Com@@ ment dialo@@ gs is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally you can also take an entry in a category to make this sub@@ category of this entry . caution , this requires you to sort out your categories alphabe@@ tically . view this .
you can move the individual elements of the Com@@ ment dialo@@ gs , by pressing the lease , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and postp@@ one it . you can also make a separate window by setting it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , you click on the button Options ... which gives you the possibility to store the current set up and appearance of the window .
you can also complete a frame completely . if you would like to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and then window a / hide . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you choose the entry pictures in the browser , you get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all the pictures in case you have no filter for this . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply configure the mouse button with the middle mouse button , configure it simply .
when you get an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture section . if you do not have a window opened with a picture @-@ view , a new display showcase will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete or select the Dele@@ te button or select in the menu Edit menu . now , you can see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ ing@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use the images stored anywhere , so you have to use the pictures anywhere , so you can record the images anywhere ; in the picture you can see the view from &amp; cold album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk .
images , where the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on your hard disk . for example , the pictures are recorded on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , the thumb@@ nail pictures are present , so that &apos;s k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the picture .
as you see , this function needs that you want to copy files from the folders and again copy . &amp; cold album ; if you want to avoid trouble as the mess fr@@ inge of your images , please buy a larger hard disk in order to save all images on it .
in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you &apos;ll also want to block the images that you want to make for others un@@ accessible and click on Lat@@ est View menu . alternatively , you can also select all the images that can see your little sister and select the menu item all out of current view .
with this , you have specified which images in the case of the case should be hidden . if you block the laptop now of your little sister , simply select the images you have blocked , hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click Sper@@ re up@@ lift .
it is also possible to set a password which must be inserted to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy .
remember that this picture prot@@ ector is not at all very safe . for one , all images on the hard disk and on the other can delete or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection serves only those who are using &amp; k@@ ing@@ album ; not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images .
the reason you can describe all your pictures with &amp; cold album ; to describe and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want them to look at some point . for this reason , it has a photo@@ copy ; for this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewing . you can preview it from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . it shows of course the image , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag these to the mouse and disc@@ laim it . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether any information is displayed . all these options are available according to a right @-@ click on the viewer . the following context menu can be seen below .
some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here on the browser , see , matching entries to this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and switch back by using the keys image high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as a slideshow . how often it loads a new image after a few seconds . how often there is a new image can be controlled by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . and now the di@@ asch@@ au is executed by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the spect@@ ator of &amp; cold album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can get into the picture and draw out zo@@ oming . to the her@@ zo@@ id you can easily pull a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can restore the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t into the middle of the picture . shows how a z@@ oom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your z@@ oom , so that the picture is not shown zo@@ omed . with the equation put the Zo@@ oms , so that each pixel will be on screen a pixel screen .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in videos that start in and out zo@@ oming using the plus and M@@ inu@@ Option are .
with the functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find an image of a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can open the drop down and configuration dialog of the picture to give these names . however , you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer , to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one after another .
for the two examples above you give the viewer the opportunity to show pictures with features while you watch them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the appropriate letters . in view of a picture , where the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in the browser . you can see all the pictures you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view . if you choose categories in D@@ re thumb@@ view , then you can add characteristics to the pictures by pressing the letter for the attribute , after the picture was chosen . you can see here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , it allows you to paint a &quot; cold album &quot; on the picture .
the Gem@@ old is not stored with the image but in the database . in the way you can re@@ vert your painted later .
in the picture you can see a picture on the painted . to switch the painting mode from the context menu . to end the image , you simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar top at the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you have to control the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully dominate but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood .
in the object @-@ tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and display the object in the wire modes yellow .
you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the lower object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects have already been selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the tool@@ bar icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following set menu is inserted so that you can choose the right position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene .
if you have altered properties , click on any application to take these changes . if you entered the invali@@ d values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and rec@@ al@@ locate the changes with abor@@ ting .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user &apos;s guide in the layout dialog , you can view the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user guide to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 contains the user &apos;s documentation .
if you edit a texture or a part of a texture you can see a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ Fe@@ b view .
press the thumb@@ nails &apos; view and a small example of the scene is en@@ cor@@ ded with the chosen texture , even if you want to choose a sub@@ ordin@@ ated item ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , crosses local .
the scre@@ enshot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is chosen , the control points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotating as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling the mouse within the whole window .
each object has a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the tool@@ bar selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window @-@ order as default . the object tree and the view of the property properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need any other arrangement , you can adjust them as you like . you can also save multiple wind@@ ings and easily change between different systems .
to anchor a window above or under any view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to re@@ arrange multiple views , drag the starter in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views through clicking on the card &apos;s card in the views .
the last possible window frames are so@@ aring views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to resolve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starter on the desktop or click the small to the left edge arrow in the form of fibre .
to view a view , click on the small cross in the fibre @-@ bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross .
you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are narrow , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be stored with window frames . it will display a dialog in which you can save the window @-@ order under an existing or new name .
when you created a scene , you can ren@@ ching it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to Ren@@ der , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to ren@@ ching the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu @-@ in view scene .
a Ren@@ der mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it controls the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and levels of quality , you can insert as many ren@@ der modes , from a quick preview to full pictures .
if you click on the icon The Ren@@ der settings in tool@@ bar , or in the menu &apos; View modes ... select , the following dialogue will be opened :
every Ren@@ der mode has a name . you can input any name , but it is a name that lets determine the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the desired image . if you want to run only one small area of the picture , select the cross@@ field sub@@ section and enter the picture @-@ section to the entry into the input fields .
in the combination of quality you can choose the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for ren@@ ders used . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user &apos;s manual page &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray .
if an image is executed with only one beam of pixels , several bugs can arise . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è @-@ pattern or stool effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed when they are in representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . in general , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . more than a ray depending on pixels . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly re@@ divided and adap@@ tive because each pixel is constantly re@@ divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ary ranges from the calculated shades .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray depending on pixels . if you set the difference between the coloring to the neighboring pixels , then both pixels are charged by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with a set of 4x@@ 4 additional points , at a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixel will be calculated : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold , the pixels will be monitored in 4 sub @-@ pixels that can be tested individually and on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of re@@ cur@@ sion can be set by low pressure .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is that the generation of smokers for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn off J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light re@@ flexi@@ on is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate one scene with that property .
on this card card , you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have no property .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expec@@ tedly ends , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene to import , select the menu @-@ on file to import ... and choose a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er now does not support the full instruction of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . . if in imports , error messages or aler@@ ts appear , a dialog windows shows a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Be@@ gin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can also drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds the source code to import into the scene , just select the source code in the editor and drag it in the object tree .
mit copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor allows you to insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also fit .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er : a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is Po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ Po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the Fe@@ atur@@ ated view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user &apos;s documentation for the displayed object . put the path to your document and the version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ timeter ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you want to include files which are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type labels .
you can adjust the object @-@ catch of points to the re@@ aster menu of the wire model . you can set the buttons separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ ders . for some objects like the ball , you can set the detailed stage for two directions .
if you inter@@ rupt the high details of detailed proj@@ ections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera is using an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections using exceptions of the perspective and the vertical proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering .
if you want to see wall , a wall behind the objects is broken down . the wall is displayed in a chess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors .
if you want to see soil the floor appears below the object , the ground is displayed in a chess break@@ water pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you activate the cant@@ er@@ ship , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method used for rendering of scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . precise information about parameters can be found in the section Ren@@ der modes .
this page allows you to change existing window frames or create new window frames . in the section window @-@ orders is explained , as you can create and store windows .
standard window frames : displays all existing window frames . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window @-@ order at the start of the program .
the list of existing window frames shows all existing window frames . a new order can be added with the button , and delete a selected order with the button Dele@@ te .
each window @-@ order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the list under the name shows all views on the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button and delete selected views with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dele@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the position of the new window . with new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ten anchor you get the window below the existing window , with card cards , you get a card hand side , in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just installed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and now you want to start without precise knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate however easy scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should read the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result can only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering as a result you receive a black image .
if you do not paste light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image .
if you have all error @-@ free installed , take a look at the first launch of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ installed window frames :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation so you can find adequate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then select the menu entry , so you have a scene without objects .
the wir@@ es model display shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular , you notice the scene from the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ers of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , see the content of the View properties tab , where the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s guide to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , please find more details .
do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera , but note that the camera can change in view control points , with which you can change the way@@ point in view . simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location .
if you press the button application or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they look at the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting end body qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that is a clear method of solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; does indeed offer a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as floor :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then push the button application or input button . in the object @-@ tree the new name is instantly displayed .
the wi@@ re@@ model view now shows the plane , although at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane stretched to horizon up to the horizon .
when you watch the object tree , you will find that you can preview the entry for the bottom , if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties .
in this scene , you should move the bottom to exercise an unit among the horizon line , just so you can get to know some of these parameters . select shifting and adjust the values as follows :
first , select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment .
in both cases a dialogue will open in which you can choose how the object should be inserted . the pig@@ ment is then displayed in the object tree . you can view the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview , see how the pig@@ ment now looks .
of course , the pig@@ ments preview is only a mat@@ ted black material , because you need to enter settings for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore , keep in mind that you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . now give the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many options now , but just take the easiest .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the qu@@ ader and ball , just click on the button users and then call the preview .
the material for the ground is now right . if you are running your picture now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color . you need to enter two new attributes , called unic@@ ar@@ big . then select this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the chess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose in object tree any time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
this step should you already be able to carry out , as you should have understood the basic function of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; already the ball can be set just as easy as the ground :
in view of the properties properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button applic@@ ators ) so that the ball might float above the ground as you have moved the ground around a unit down .
of course , the rendering yields now a strange result : as previously seen before , the ball surface appears like a mat@@ ted black material . put in the following step a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to her . as already in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color :
select first object and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of pig@@ ment , select a mono@@ chrome and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on any application or press the input button .
the settings she@@ en effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal@@ lic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what features you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful scen@@ eries .
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a ren@@ der method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
if you are a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ tions , the Ren@@ der hypo@@ the@@ tical R@@ ays from the perspective of the spect@@ ator ( i.e. from the camera that the scenes ) reflects through the objects and how atmospheric effects like for example fog have effects . so the scene is processed pixels for pixels .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , any scene that should be hur@@ led , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made using &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open up a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage place .
presents the scene in the last recorded version . all changes since the last store are rejected .
this menu entry can only select if you still do not have stored changes in the scene .
repeated the last set @-@ up command . this menu entry can only select if you have used re@@ fr@@ ing@@ ently .
saves the current window order and opens a dialogue where you can enter a name for a new type of arrangement , or write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the standard behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add @-@ commands with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ set for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pre @-@ use surface , without having to model any b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the ge@@ ometric form of object itself .
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file both for a b@@ ump map as well as a texture map .
basic body are simple ge@@ ometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object on a pixel base , using a image file as a color map .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image considering and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the picture or in full @-@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ O ; or the Return / button .
you can set if every image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images always use the same window .
if you are looking for a particular file , just tap the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small entry box appears in the lower right corner . if a password file has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing returns or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue inser@@ tion - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short @-@ command for the display cabinet and short @-@ command for the browser , you can set the short@@ cuts for each window .
if this is selected , the images are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background colour , which you can set down below . default is not a full @-@ screen mode .
this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when cutting the name of the recently opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the coloured beam to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , also here the background with the selected color is filled .
you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed that the program can represent .
this option is enabled for large images to display the display in@@ display on the full screen . this option is switched on as default .
determine if the slideshow is to begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time period between the image change in a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value to the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default : 3 seconds .
the number of re@@ ps is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value to the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of operation from &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the box circuit short @-@ command for the display window and short @-@ command for the browser .
with this option you turn between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window around .
displays major symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short term .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short term .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
the image increases by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
closes the display cabinet for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling code is activated .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing , based on the &amp; desk ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; management came ; project .
&amp; show@@ y photo ; is a quick image processing with some powerful basics tools . you can use it to look at your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .

the best start to participate in the show@@ piece ; it is the developer mail@@ ing@@ list to join . guidance to join the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ y ; .
&amp; show@@ y photo ; tries to give you so much control over his work flows as possible . change to the settings you need to set up in the Settings menu . you can switch between these settings in eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing the symbols of the left side .
in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indi@@ ces should be selected . skill mode should display the colors with what you are supposed to display , contrast , under@@ exposed should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ piece , owns a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and promotions to the selected images . the same page bar you can see , in which you click on one of the five horse@@ men :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not do more than scan and save .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images , which no longer makes a dialog to scan and save . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save a dialog to be saved , or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before the file .
you can check the status of your scanner at the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the Command Line of &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command c@@ anti@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner was specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and OK to open the scanner . interrup@@ ting &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; end .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) does not cover these options particularly .
to add a picture , the user can only start a preview , and then scan for scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to select the image better the user can get into the image and out of the current selection zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the z@@ oom that the complete preview is fit in the window .
if the picture was chosen then the final picture can be read with the Scan button .
if before saving a preview display in the settings , the image is displayed in a showcase , as shown below is indicated . if saving is pressed , then the image gets saved and foil ? en leads to a departure and you will get back to the main window .
the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the ep@@ onymous dialogue will be opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can look at the picture if desired , prior to saving . in this case , the option before saving a preview display . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option has to be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images save . dialogue to store for each image open the dialog before each inserted picture . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you have to be saved without a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the option of storing without a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for the dialog to store . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically used images and is moreover the proposed name for the image in the dialog to store . the automatically saved picture gets a numer@@ ical Su@@ ff@@ ix which is stored every time if a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adapt the image quality to be saved . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button help starts the KDE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About the KDE Over -@@ Dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button &apos; settings shows the dialog for settings and shots can be used to complete &amp; sk@@ in@@ ite ; to end .

&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; used like all other programs buttons . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and their function . below you can set up a list of this short@@ cut button and glob@@ als short@@ cuts you set up by clicking with the right mouse button into the player window and set short command ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; -@@ short command to work . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; control center .
the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ o@@ K has many general functions , which mostly can be found in other KDE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the dating features of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP feature &apos;s break could be &amp; b ; look like this :
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the Head@@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; . additionally , Amar@@ o@@ ok has some own command options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script as if all necessary modules are present and make use of dialog , so that the user knows why a script does not run .
B@@ EG@@ IN A &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ und@@ um ( KDE Bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos;@@ k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the base for your own scripts . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Amar@@ o@@ K and Amar@@ o@@ K . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p command ; which every KDE installation should be attached .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the output of external programs and commands . this is usually used the function ex@@ ec ( ) . this way it can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; sends aler@@ ts to all running scripts . for this reason , str@@ ings will be able to monitor their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can even ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . to save the storing and loading of the furniture data you have to worry about each script . when a script is started , Amar@@ o@@ ok places the work@@ folder onto the folder , where all data should be stored .
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played . the script could now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP features further information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ et@@ change new@@ volume sign@@ aled a change in volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ men@@ tion@@ e@@ ti@@ cked , revelation the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be used . to remove the script to remove the cli@@ cked menu . to remove an entry back d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script re@@ mo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; stopped , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do e.g. setting up output . for example , it includes saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ u scrip@@ ting script can also install script packages that can be downloaded for the user &amp; z@@ b ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .t@@ ar ) , which can also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can detect the archive clearly as Amar@@ o@@ K script .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Advanced script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to lo@@ oming modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain file rights :
if your script is done , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and download the link to the Wi@@ ki Skri@@ ll page from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; attached . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the Amar@@ o@@ K category ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly simple to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of going through endless menus . perhaps you only look for a very specific title of thousands of items in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ tive browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you never decide which you want to hear ? then , the playlist browser is just right for you . and if the decision is still difficult , select the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ o@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many other audio systems can be used , so you can listen to your music . these and yet many more useful features make Amar@@ o@@ ok at the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music !
usually you need to enter the bas@@ ok @-@ sources the following set @-@ up on Amar@@ o@@ K , to compile and install Amar@@ o@@ K :
since &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; auto@@ graphs and autom@@ ake use , you should have no trouble with the compile . if you encounter any problems , please report it in the &amp; k@@ w ; mail@@ ing@@ lists .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; has as most applications , some options , which you can enable or disable the compile @-@ time with the configure script . this is a list of options available .
for some of the comp@@ ili@@ er@@ options , certain dependen@@ cies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the section system requirements .
activated Debug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; you should use full use .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can set up with no effort on the furnishings dialog . the furniture dialog has several cart@@ on cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; .
player Windows displays the player @-@ window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the playlist @-@ window is displayed .
voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
set up : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; with support for m@@ ood@@ able , the color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer has been altered .
voting files in the music files are available : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar coded . if this setting is activated , .@@ No files are stored in the configuration folder of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / Amar@@ o@@ K / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser which is not listed in the list above .
playlist in saving , save the current playlist automatically when cutting &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist of the ends .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; relative paths to the music files , from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files are stored .
the current piece will be visible at the change of change , that the play@@ lists window opened - / rolls to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when switching to the context @-@ browser , you automatically exchange the context @-@ browser once the next piece is played .
in the section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section .
in the fon@@ ts section you can use the use of different writings in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the otherwise grey section can be used . you can choose writings for the following section : play@@ lists window , player windows and context @-@ browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a type font to choose from the selection dialog .
with the choice of custom color scheme , you yourself have the Qu@@ al of choice and can set a private color scheme . use the among them the chosen color select for front and background colour .
play the start with the start , that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; after the program start , the play@@ back will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which it stopped at the final end .
the window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is shown , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview .
the first option is the font . click to select ... to select from dialog box you want to select the type font for the OS@@ D . the cross@@ fire shadow causes that the text in OS@@ D is sha@@ ded sha@@ ded .
own colors will give you the possibility to adjust the OS@@ D colors for script and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to color choices . if own colors do not use , the aforementioned &amp; D colors are used .
the input field display text marks the text shown in the OS@@ D . by typ@@ ing plac@@ ings , the OS@@ D can be adjusted to suit your needs . below you will find a list of the available wild@@ card and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ box environment the OS@@ D should appear .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers activate further settings in this card card .
the card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; search for music files . in order to include a folder into the collection , just mark the cross@@ bar next to its name . this section also contains inter@@ sti@@ ckers to inser@@ ts , as shall be used with the selected folders procedures .
sub@@ folders recur@@ sively search : this causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders after music is being used .
make changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; to monitor the selected files on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to be able to make the necessary changes to your collection .
playlist import@@ ing : causes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part Collec@@ tor database is used to select a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ ations@@ feld drivers : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected , another institution is necessary in the Unter@@ S@@ ql facility .
the My@@ S@@ ql device is used for inser@@ ting the database for &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; it is used on the computer , on which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , which the connection is made .
use a user name : and password : for inser@@ ting the data that is needed to connect to the database .
the card is last@@ .@@ f@@ m , the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m is available . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; can provide the names of pieces of pieces on a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and set some music recommendations on the current piece .
here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can sign up on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send off pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ts : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K , a list with similar interpre@@ ters can retrieve to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screens .
Amar@@ o@@ K takes only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further KDE packages . you must have K@@ deli@@ bs thus installed ( including those included in it ) , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to comp@@ osing K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions , such as the OS@@ D set ahead , that your window manager will function the relevant standards of free@@ des@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but flu@@ x@@ box will help , for example , we &apos;re trying to assist Amar@@ o@@ ok on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they are ready to provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can preview the file by sending it into ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / Amar@@ a / collection _ scan@@ .@@ log file . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ ft@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and attach it to the cap@@ ut@@ te file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and restore the collection again .
most of the time it is that Tag@@ lib before reading the Met@@ a @-@ info@@ s from this file cr@@ ashes . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is a bit mature .
ensure that all libraries are compiled by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; used libraries with the same compiler version are compiled . if for example &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to disman@@ tling the met@@ a @-@ information .
if you &apos;re using KDE with art@@ s@@ d then disable them . switch off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically opening at a crash ) . if it is a frequent er@@ pillar and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be repaired .
this is due to the fact that many program details can write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but this cannot be identified as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ 39@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ) ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; errors in writing the tags from $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K &apos;s icons are always active in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known fault in KDE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbolic effects are easily forgotten . you can find the status de@@ activated on grey and semi @-@ transparent . please note that in some cases you must click on a symbol up to three times until this attitude reveals its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : wrong symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ o@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ o@@ app &apos;s _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ o@@ ok finds the correct version first .
there are several options . most installation problems clarify the ligh@@ test by using an expert in your Uni@@ xes or lin@@ ux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or with the developers . use this forum and the IR@@ C among ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ ad@@ o@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please just enter a mistake there if you do something on the removal of a bug in Amar@@ o@@ ok itself .
after starting off &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come there ?
that &apos;s easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under ex@@ tras .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the rating by the user while the points will be automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces in the playlist , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select column Show . you can also use the short command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; too . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ K is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button to select your choice and then select from the playlist from the fold @-@ up menu .
drag a playlist to the playlist and drop them there , just as you would do it with other files . so simple is that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the add @-@ button , you can save the button playlist . click on it .
probably you lack the program x@@ m@@ ms config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; new . take a look for li@@ b@@ ulation , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( available across the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras .
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! not ! &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; uses one out of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question of loud media types support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? .
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 @-@ Dec@@ oder are provided ( for patent @-@ related reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s off : - )
if you use the G@@ dy@@ amer driver with the al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a bl@@ ender . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously use audio @-@ bl@@ ender ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa . take a look at the assistance D@@ mix for Al@@ sa .
the output of this command should help you look for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ cars ) .
that does &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; already . do not forget that media should be de@@ coded by simply a white smoke . casting is reading the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data first . G@@ stre@@ amer can print straight to Al@@ sa , just as also x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia sound system . activate sound servers with highest possible priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set :
at KDE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ D co@@ dec@@ s that can cause un@@ disturbed play@@ back . read this error report . read the magni@@ fier of the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa @-@ setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install KDE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the quicker Arts @-@ Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ c &amp; etc ; ) .
probably you use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less contracts respond the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us correct it .
G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ stre@@ amer driver , cr@@ ashes &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; off . why ?
after the installation of G@@ Stre@@ amer you need to register all components . perform the ST @-@ register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ o@@ K before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg down , compile and install it . perform the module @-@ folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST reg@@ isters again . start now &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; .
please tell about it at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ o@@ for@@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an album of British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic c ... : )
thanks to D@@ COP this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let you perform the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; exp@@ ires before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken of the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of the bed .
how can you find current in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; running tracks if you &apos;re on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . Th@@ er@@ command gives you interpretation and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ I ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP @-@ address with your IP address and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this requires that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA exists .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; window will be separated . click on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button puts a piece in the queue correctly . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player &apos;s window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ ous functions , but what about the symbol in the system section of the control panel ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; click on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ MB@@ O &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS @-@ drive . after starting from Amar@@ o@@ ok the collection database can not be created and on the console appear many error messages . what &apos;s now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / Amar@@ o@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ k@@ s MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . you can switch to a file browser with multiple folders . you can switch a few pieces and drag them into the desired folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code instead take files from folders mp3 or og@@ g .

basically , this adap@@ ts the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result .
you can insert the rating for a piece by clicking on a column trans@@ cript in the playlist window . here , you can select the rating of a piece of mouse on a column , namely , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : evaluation or F@@ 2 press . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog Met@@ adata .
the developers don &apos;t want to present you when you plan to release a stable version of Amar@@ o@@ K . this means KDE packages have a fixed release plan that will not bring together with the short @-@ term schedule of Amar@@ o@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ o@@ ok that some users can find quite annoying . disable the option icon when playing animated in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool to set up ... and take the changes you need .
download a design , or create your own . install this then under Amar@@ o@@ ok ... appearance context @-@ browser design , click new design ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) to avoid difficulties , it was removed .

Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to information about which pieces can be played on an independent server . the service is free of charge and you only need a free us@@ ername and a password . audio kit is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K .
if you would like to use al@@ sa , please the latest available version . old Al@@ sa versions have a lot of stor@@ my and therefore a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K , compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compile this output modules . you must configure &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; newly configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; newly installed , but the output modules are still not released . and now ?
probably you use a distribution which install the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed , the necessary developer files are installed . you must now install the package g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that , you need to re@@ compile and install .
I get the mistake G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ ational . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer with no P@@ rel@@ ational . a tip of Merlin TC : uses no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ o@@ K .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module is g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad installed .

I have a second sound card and use al@@ sa . how can I use Amar@@ o@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
among settings Amar@@ o@@ ok set ... audio output enter the device . typical for example h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine using an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Code@@ c and a USB audio device :

insert in the setup dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of the scan@@ rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not be taken care of . you may of course take this problem yourself in your hand ! if you like , you can be the new so urgently needed car@@ ers for Arts : )
music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the furnis@@ hing assist@@ ants that will be shown at the first start by &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; if you want to update your collection , or the assistant just do not like , then this Quick start @-@ guide will be a help . with their help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag the mouse entries from the listing browser into the playlist . type in the box . type in the box . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it using the playlist playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window .
if you have own playlist , you can add them to the playlist . if you have enabled the playlist in the folder of your collection , you can already get the playlist to a playlist . with a right @-@ click on a playlist , you can get various options , as the playlist should be loaded .
to play an audio CD , select in the menu bar , select actions audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders and the CD @-@ pieces in the W@@ AV format . drag the W@@ AV files to the playlist and then press the button play .
the audio CD feature uses the protocol audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all drivers available .
the burning function is available in the playlist . simply click on an entry and follow the Burn menu . here you have different ways to burning a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; sets the installation of some software packages . the required binary packages are listed below . additionally , some additional packages will be listed , which make working with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; pleasant .
if you install this package via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like every normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; however , a playlist that is superior to all the others . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers , with which you can capture your entire music collection .
in this chapter , explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K will be used , including creating a collection and playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; control center . at the top of the window is a running context , which is currently playing current piece or the current stream stream . right underneath , the range , the game time , bit@@ rate and sam@@ pl@@ agi@@ ar@@ ate of the current piece . a click on this area changes the indication of the already exp@@ ired games at the remaining time of the piece .
in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the tre@@ ad context . you can switch by the available analy@@ zer by clicking the area with the left mouse button .
the &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is shown in an independent , enlarged window .
under the tre@@ ad you can also find the buttons , PL and E@@ Q . the PL PL is activated or de@@ activated the play@@ lists window , used during the E@@ Q button for setting up equ@@ ali@@ zer .
the rest of the player @-@ window consists of play@@ back buttons , the volume control , and the piece of sound sli@@ ders . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or the volume . with the play@@ back buttons , you can start playing / stop and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in E@@ quali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 preference settings , from Klassik to Tech@@ no , and you can easily create their own preferences .
to display the E@@ quali@@ zer you will use ex@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the button E@@ Q in the player window . once you highlight the starter field E@@ quali@@ zer , the E@@ quali@@ zer is in operation .
the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; is the most widely developed playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many functions , which does not exist in any other player . but let yourself be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the playlist window can be divided into two main sections , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context @-@ browser . on the right hand side is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ window : music , text and interpre@@ ters . these three sub@@ windows are later used in detail . they provide information on the ongoing play to each of the different aspects .
if you &apos;ve already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; perhaps you might be noticed that the sub@@ window will be dropped off . the information presented here is now collected in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; moreover , the information in the statistical window will be collected ( ex@@ tras statistics ) .
the window window shows information about the current piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title , the name of the piece , interpreter and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a musical Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to detect the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon you will find further information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time , as well as its assessment .
to view cover pictures in the context @-@ browser , the cover images are supported in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ jpg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gif and .@@ p@@ n@@ g will be supported . the context browser will also display cover images that have been downloaded with the cover management or have been embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces on . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set what information in the music window will be displayed . click on the right @-@ click anywhere in the window window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the interpreter , lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be up and you see the content of the album .
you can click on all pieces in the individual fields to immediately start playing . you can also click with the right mouse button to click on it and then select from the context menu one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist .
in the text window text , the downloaded lyrics for the current piece is displayed . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text editor from other websites . once you click on the text sub@@ window , please read the text for the piece on the Internet . if there is no text script running , you can choose which should be started .
the button Re@@ work allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; &apos;s collection database . this is not a run text @-@ script required .
the button Find out a search on the text box for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly beneath the interpreter . albums or gen@@ res are being ignored .
group@@ ing interpre@@ t / Album - First will be arranged the pieces by interpre@@ t and below will be a further distribution according to the new album . if you want to see interaction or soundtrack albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are shown at the start of the list under different interpre@@ ters .
group@@ ing performer / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name is used .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreted - your pieces are first sorted by genre , including by interpre@@ ters .
this setting genre / Interpre@@ t / album - this setting works just like the above , yet still sorted by album beneath the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust the group@@ ing entirely to exposure and combine .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
directly under the tool@@ bar you find a search filter . it beha@@ ves right in the list view as well as in the modular view . information about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . besides , you can of course choose your overall collection , which makes the filter convenient .
by clicking on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities .
download - This le@@ ert the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .

sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis - changes a compilation of the album back into a normal album . the album will no longer be displayed under different interpre@@ ts but back under the interpreter .
the playlist @-@ browser is designed to deal with a lot of play@@ lists . among other things he also contains Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
even yourself , the intelligent@@ sia &apos;s play@@ lists are possible . click on the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new intelligence playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub @-@ window media player is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; for example , use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpre@@ ts in the upper list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop them on the list item . if you are done , the pieces will be up@@ loaded onto your iPod . when the transfer is complete , exit &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K , and solve the running works for your iPod .
under the tool@@ bar you find a search area where you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden , which do not correspond to your search criteria .
in the lower part of the browser @-@ browser you can get a address bar , with which you can get music from an absorbed ur@@ l . if you press for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z to access music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it down .
when the playlist is longer than in the window square , the hanging of files can be helpful by simply folding . in the case , the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the corner of the mouse .
the playlist makes all of you attached to the attached pieces . you can change the order by simply drag the entries into the desired location . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter so long the back @-@ button until the text box is empty again .
if you are typ@@ ed by spaces separate search terms , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; after entries are searching for , which include all search terms . if you enter for example one or two , the search will contain all entries , one , two and three .
when you enter between the search terms , will be searched for entries , either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination of it ) .
if you want to search for entries , the spaces are included , then attach the search term with griff@@ on feet : Mike Old@@ field . this makes for entries sought by Mike Old@@ field , but not for applications such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a certain search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece which does not contain a particular search term , make a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syn@@ tax variations for expos@@ ing with one another . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
you can set the play@@ ability of entries by pressing the Str@@ g button , and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then get a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be re@@ printed .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you can add the button to add to which you can add the playlist pieces . to the right next , you can save playlist , playlist , and random@@ ly mixing .
next , the buttons are back @-@ running and re@@ producing . so you can re@@ vert or re @-@ re@@ vert changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . via this menu , you can set &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example re @-@ output controls and speaker regul@@ ator . you can set up the buttons presented by clicking on the menu and set the tool@@ bar ... select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information on the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the playing time of the current piece . the status for random smo@@ dus and re @-@ fetch is easily changed by clicking with the mouse twice in the corresponding ad area .
you can also choose the status bar . in addition , select the status bar option in general settings .
the context menu allows you to click through a click with the right mouse button into the player window , or by clicking on the playlist menu . via this menu , you can reach the settings from &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K .
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alization @-@ ins . here you can select the visu@@ alizations of &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; select .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; .
the Cover management is a useful tool to manage your Cover images . you can launch them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management includes a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the Interpre@@ t on the left side .
with the menu view you can choose what is to be displayed in the Cover administration . select from :
the queu@@ es administration received your big pull in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control over the playlist . that number represents the order in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the pieces will play : 1 will first play , 2 as second , and so on .
the queue is open to the queu@@ es . if you want to add a piece for the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also use the pieces easily with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then change in the queue administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already presented ( the details for setting up these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during the play .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : audio cro@@ b@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces in your playlist can be found . you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
click double to the playlist , drag them to the playlist window , or click the right button . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new button . you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two default modes of random mix and playlist mix fill out immediately your playlist , and you can start the play@@ back directly . the recommended pieces will add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will each be added at the next piece of play , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , then activate the latest possible dynamic mode : settings dynam@@ ical mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . via the same menu @-@ entry the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again .
the button new fill the current playlist and add new pieces in accordance with the dynamic mode . playlist , edit the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the appropriate settings .
with a right @-@ click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . ther@@ eu@@ pon , the dialog opens to the editing of the playlist of the playlist .
type here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this attitude is not active , your playlist will continually grow , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and they will not be able to hear a piece of double in this playlist . if the setting is active , the pieces will be removed , taking into account the setting of ges@@ ted pieces .
split pieces - this is the number of played pieces , which are to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to see which pieces have been recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you set up here more than 1 , the playlist will continually grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right @-@ hand side have already been described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialogue , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you will cross several playlist , &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; random pieces will add from each of the noted play@@ lists .
some scripts permit own settings . you can adjust settings by starting the script and then click on inser@@ tion .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; scripts , by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry is displayed on the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the button Ad@@ ditional scripts .
if you do not want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script then click to un@@ install .
if you are looking for information on writing your scripts , please see the writing scripts .
the dialog window visu@@ alization @-@ plug@@ ins will be used for activating the available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ K ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply enable the Connec@@ ting field next to the name .
this quick guide will show you how you can create an audio CD in four steps . in order to comprehend the steps , you must have a running installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a loss of losses . use the CD@@ t@@ ect project .
in this dialogue window , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this quick guide will show you how you can copy with &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; an data @-@ CD in just four steps . to trace the steps , you must have a loud installation of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and you have inserted the Qu@@ ell @-@ CD into the CD @-@ Rom .

&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ c@@ record ; : burn all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions , which also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o , offers , and extends these functions even . therefore , &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality in burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . Internet programs are commonly referred to as Ripper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data flock . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis De@@ ko@@ - and Encoder modules .
mad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio @-@ Dec@@ oder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
LA@@ ME : a far developed MP3 decoder , which can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial ducks . LA@@ ME is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
F@@ LA@@ C : a free open source code for loss of free audio compression and compression . it is used by the F@@ LA@@ C decoder module and the external audio Encoder module so you can read F@@ LA@@ C files and write files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , F@@ LA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code W@@ MA files to convert them to an audio CD afterwards .
so@@ x : an aid program that can convert between different audio formats - and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video review . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully equipped author@@ itative system for editing , disco@@ vers and analy@@ sing of video CDs and super @-@ video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to match the volume of music files on a standard level . it can be useful for example to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recep@@ tions of the different albums can lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are differently distributed according to .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge projects again . the related sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously mentioned file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
saves the current project under a new file name . KDE &apos;s dialog is displayed under which you can choose folders and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all @-@ opened projects . this is the same as if you were calling for each individual project file store .
includes the current project . if a project has changed and has not been saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to happen . then you can then drop the shot and keep the project open .
includes all @-@ opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ stored project to do what has to happen , just as if you were called saved for each project file .
includes all @-@ opened projects and finished &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any un@@ stored project is asked , what should happen to it as if you had called file scar@@ let .
if you call this entry , you can select from the releases dialog files to add to the project . that has the same effect as if you select the files directly from the top view in the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files appear in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Properties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , to burning the medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burning dialogue can only open if the project has already data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data @-@ CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this is useful when you import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not used files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s more useful for you to be used as help , so that you can see the files already existing on the medium already existing files and folders .
this entry only appears on an active data @-@ CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function causes &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium ; it only ends the previous imported files again .
opens the CD @-@ copying dialogue . this also allows you to create a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can also only create a screen from a CD which you then later want to burn . besides , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also choose cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs .
opens the DVD copying dialog . this allows you to create only one image of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only one image of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the spelling and incre@@ mental .
burns an previously created CD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file are currently not supported by pushing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burns a previously created DVD @-@ screen . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down by pushing the burning button .
a previously illuminated DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used as single @-@ standing . it contains information about the video , code settings , and even ways to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the occasional medium . this information is shown in the content view and include characteristics of the medium , such as size and title @-@ length of CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is crossed , a small box at the bottom of the window appears . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden .
turn the folder view , or off . the folder view includes an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context @-@ menu with functions such as media info , locking and dra@@ gging the disk or throwing the medium .
switches the index view or off . the index allows to select and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the index is also the interface to read about audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
switches the Cop@@ y box in the project view , or out . the p@@ utt@@ iste is a narro@@ wer area that contains only visible when the project view open projects . the p@@ utt@@ iste has no real function , it looks just pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views .
this will open a dialog window to change the keyboard arrangements for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . after you have chosen one of the commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key@@ code to further down .
this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnis@@ hing coaches . thus , the correct per@@ missions to be adjusted for burning of CDs and DVDs . therefore , system managers are required , so you need to enter the password for the system manager ( root ) .
open the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . here , general programs can be made . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and to arrange the exclu@@ siveness of the program .
&amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ ies ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell scripts .
to use the &amp; D@@ COP 18 functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or use the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ ary distance , so it is rather your taste and the kind of your formulation is crucial to what the included programs you give in .
in this chapter we take that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; features that have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; primarily two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions like copy@@ CD , format DVD and other features for generating new projects .
D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f Cream CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) A@@ COP@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void copy@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void ) D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ ur@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly generated project : D@@ COP@@ Re@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b / audi@@ oc@@ d ) and then reference to the project obtained via # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project D@@ urch Use this reference is it possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b provides the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface as well as the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Pro@@ ject@@ Interface , which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void add@@ add@@ Ur@@ l ( Q@@ string , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void re@@ mo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) void set@@ Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folder and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT _ co@@ p / home / tru@@ eg / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ les@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; . with him can easily be stored audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the one installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for use of &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on the hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders ( loss @-@ free compression ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( loss @-@ free compression ) are required ( loss @-@ free compression ) . other enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per title ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as the loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ au@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ fier . all these programs are usually not necessarily required for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile something itself . however , if F@@ LA@@ C is not used , the installation is also not required .
which code format / file format is to be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ fier gives a small introduction about Ko@@ di@@ ver , Audio quality and compression factors .
a word for copying from protected audio CD ; s : as previously said , used &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copying audio CD ; it is not possible to handle any copying audio CD ; even do not eliminate the mechanisms of copying them . simply avoid the purchase of head @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while the installation has to be made only once ( the installation dialog , however , can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily usage for the reading of a &amp; CD . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get from the Internet or can be complete without network , whereby everything is covered manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . on the page step by step example , further information such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the maps for the configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB inquiry of the CD @-@ data corresponding to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . )
start reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the setup settings in the setup catalogue - the coding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder so that the selection can be read with a different Encoder to be the standard . it &apos;s notice that previously the Encoder has been configured in the editing tab in the setup mode .
opens the file manager , so that one already selected file to code is selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; to read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( like protocols , Pie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main initial dialog of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right cooking .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the cons are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can give these files back .
among the audio formats , the information generated by data comp@@ iling according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit@@ rate the differences will be less important since both codi@@ fier produce very good audio quality .
o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided with most distri@@ butions free , but there are open license questions
+ high @-@ quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices are available .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stere@@ otypes . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format .
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for other parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = this setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11th 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music by young people , portable devices and car stere@@ os@@ o@@ facilities . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et Ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or transmitted by the program automatically from the free@@ DB are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code name for the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files .
in connection with Ko@@ di@@ stro programs , there is often a combination of programs for the co@@ di@@ ans and the parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers declare the switches for these programmes .
for example around the &amp; CD ; add titles to the keywords ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; par@@ ame@@ ters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the assistant ) :
this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can download the audio CDs , allowing all other information to download and enter into the computer instead of it : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ tri@@ m of the author : that is the author meant ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there &apos;s more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be attached . all information can be obtained in case of a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual .
in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; Ak@@ tiv actively to select an address ( Send a address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can not be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address when retri@@ ev@@ ing the data from server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
in many countries there are copies of the main database . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for the use of free@@ DB , ge@@ ographi@@ cally is used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a list of Spie@@ gel@@ servers for online call from &amp; CD ; information available during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded , or ( usually done monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which les@@ bian program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. it has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. it has to be noted that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done .
to store the full W@@ AV files the codi@@ fier and thus the desired file format can be chosen . at the first opening , there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) on the tab to inser@@ tion the code . other co@@ aster can be added to this tab .
the codi@@ fier package must be installed by the respective lin@@ ux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ ver can be used . further information about Ko@@ di@@ ver can be found in Chapter One Ko@@ di@@ fier .
after installing another code , you can get more information about your switches through the input of a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ der window ( eg . sole ) . it must &apos; l@@ ame &apos; be replaced by the name of the installed body .
this can have many causes . check the furnishings of the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the spelling and read@@ sheets of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what &apos;s wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , these tips can give you how to proceed .
have read the complete manual , everything is understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will launch the program for the first time , all set up and our first &amp; CD ; read l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s using a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps for average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
you need to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be used as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame may be found for example with a search engine , since it is considered not completely free software . at least it is not necessary to compile source files , which you can do of course always .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have scre@@ aming access to it ( eg . by trying to copy a bit ) .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what to be repeated for each trig@@ gering &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
here we decide to use the compression of code for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to use the &amp; CD ; download data from the Internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it in any release of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is handed over to the les@@ bian program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces can read .
frequently , the / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card supports General settings . here you can not do much . here , an additional transformation can be defined . in our example everything is shown as bel@@ low / input as in the scre@@ enshot is shown .
only in full information can be selected , so that you will be informed if details concerning the detection of keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer has to be connected while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
the second selection field is simpler , is a &amp; CD ; entry found starts immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; which is later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / fil@@ en@@ ame - &gt; ren@@ ame the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
aside from this example , if you want to manually input everything manually , so disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not use it twice . however , these over 6@@ 20 MB large , consider this twice to be worthwhile . to use free@@ DB in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card .
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ ev@@ ing the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD is to be received ? read the section on free@@ DB . put it all as it is in the scre@@ enshot .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB Server : please go to the website fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your area . on this way the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both work equally as for the server , but there are many fire@@ walls to boot the protocol 88@@ 80 default vineg@@ ar , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server transmit . the first inter@@ sti@@ cal field should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number simultaneously beg@@ inner pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try his own .
CD ; for the reading of the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial exp@@ ires .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this , then the W@@ AV files can be specified in which the W@@ AV files are stored . if the box is not included , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files .
everything to enter as it is in the scre@@ enshot : the command is a bit long , under circumstances a little bit has to be made to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi@@ fi stereo equipment . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of generating tags at version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1.@@ ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of used metap@@ AV files at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to convert more than one W@@ AV file at the same time .
this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any release of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section is described , as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; to disk the hard drive . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard disk is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will be described , must be repeated for each application &amp; CD ; to be repeated .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the scre@@ enshot shows a little different from the data cleared for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of storing them from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive , which was defined in the main window , will be dra@@ gged .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only happens when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers for the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully completed by the free@@ DB , all the songs of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed .
in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window bund@@ led and you can select the database entry in your opinion best to your &amp; CD ;
if you do not have the cross@@ field for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialogue for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but you may need the access to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ editor - entry of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece on the first line of the input field &apos; Up@@ eller title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered into the input field &apos; updating title &apos; unless you have compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ff per piece , the comment box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after successful withdrawal of data from the free@@ DB the CD Editor is not empty , but it has always been a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor , so that you may not only start with the artist &apos;s and album names ( e.g. if all words are happy with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ tags . this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , Album and title of a piece and on only 28 signs for the commentary area . if you set up ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have set up unlimited field @-@ length , at least for what &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option will be set up on the Co@@ di@@ er@@ set settings ; take a look at the &apos; basic settings &apos; tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by any co@@ er@@ ors or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ fier to get more information .
simply select an entry which obviously agrees with the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; data anyway does not transmit . for further information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are available under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you can see that the fields marked for the album already filled with the entries we have for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece on any case and other information you desire .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way to complete all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown on the piece list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that there is a check @-@ sign before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line indicates the selection of the piece , or num@@ b the button all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the button selection selecting the les@@ bian process , so this window appears to confirm confirmation . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and track what is running .
click the tab orders to switch on the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the tool@@ bar of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read out on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left corner of the window in the status bar .
this error message is when you are trying to work with a co@@ aster that you have not yet installed . pieces which were not successfully codi@@ fied with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the tmp @-@ file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - )
now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the appearance of the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have added a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus read the status of the status in the bottom of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing seems to be configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is unclear . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 does not appear to have problem at simultaneous failure and code ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is coded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ger . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time is in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ aster of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; will entertain now within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the col@@ lateral media package . most distri@@ butions are already included a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; D package . if you are reading this , you probably have done it ...
this section is directed to individuals who are compiled by source files , and not for users who are intended to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best read the step by step to know the options and settings . it displays the photos of the various card settings , and also includes comments for options that are not used for example .
hi , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked right after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual for &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; who also wants to add something useful or change it may . at least only after contact with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and is therefore agreed with this suggestion .
strange if it has been able to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Car@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others , he has not received with real @-@ time gra@@ fik as well as kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke and kar@@ aoke bars .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it is based on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; D . support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ures project driver , which is needed for the CIS cards . al@@ sa is included as soon as there is a sequ@@ en@@ zer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by means of lifting the keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can get in &amp; k@@ de ; every MIDI file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window on K@@ Mid can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or textures ) . K@@ Mid will automatically determine the procedure used .
seat support . if you finish &amp; k@@ de ; ending a song of a song , the mid @-@ Mid starts again next time with the same song .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , A@@ we , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog , with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from one &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; mi@@ mid ; this will also work with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and beg@@ ged the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play from the menu or num@@ bed the vac@@ ancy .
please note that &amp; mi@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you pull it on the &amp; mid ; window pull it . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then merged each other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece of play , you can jump in any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator and drive .
if you find that a song is too fast or too slow to play , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space @-@ button has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space break , like a pressure on the button break or the selection of the menu entry in the menu , interrup@@ ts the play@@ back . pressing the vac@@ ancy while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the play@@ back .
lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use textures , others use lyrics , and other both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; mi@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed , and even better : the E@@ ign@@ ist@@ type is automatically determined that you need to manually set the drop @-@ in text . if you want to change anything manually in the menu settings , you have still the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to set an E@@ ign@@ ist@@ type , select from the menu settings the entries De@@ dic@@ ation or song events . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . this will be played by a number of MIDI files . in this section , you can use the collections efficiently .
to create a collection , you first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name for the collection .
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can define the desired ones you want .
in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . take care of when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song using the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
if automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece will automatically be added to the active collection by opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) automatically .
when Autom@@ atically add to the collection not enabled , at the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and performed . this collection will then continue to be added pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click away .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the row after the sub@@ menu , the menus are played in sequence , as they were added to the collection .
when you add songs or remove random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ established .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list about the kar@@ aoke text .
to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the button arrow right .
to switch back a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu , or press the button arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button Dele@@ te .
the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , this does not matter , since they are not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved .
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ MIDI @-@ MIDI events translate into events that synthes@@ izer .
for example , you can create a MIDI map , conver@@ ts all events of type Change Her@@ to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and can sound the trumpet as originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all Sound@@ cards GM are GM -@@ compatible ( incl@@ . A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all necessary requirements for the playing of a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . but for this , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ...
you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are non @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section , the patches of General MIDI will be depicted on your specific keyboard . the general usage looks as follows :
please note that the left side of the equality character is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to set the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported by a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with Ton 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . in addition , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section :
so when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , no matter which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drummer patch of the patch is meant , with which every sound is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ er instrument ( drums , bas@@ ins , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone signi@@ fies the tone @-@ height of the ever same drum ( like him possess some key@@ boards ) .
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to specify how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the order of lines is very important , as well as its presence . so you must create 128 entries .
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used primarily to cover sounds on the perim@@ eter channel . take a look at the key@@ maps provided as an example .
this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to s@@ wap the first and second channel , you simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have percussion to a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based upon the following patterns :
n is the channel , which is shown on the channel N . if you use key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will naturally use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch is always used patch x .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the Per@@ k@@ ine patch on the perim@@ eter channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ Rati@@ o indicates which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ Event shall be multip@@ lied with the value , this is credited with the formula * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used to make no dec@@ imal measure .
this setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some key@@ boards up to an oc@@ tave . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find it in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings
the canal view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ ons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this Cla@@ vi@@ aturen you see which tones are just played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can choose an instrument , the button shines no more green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the se@@ al@@ view has ( up to now ) two different views , to view the played notes . in the menu , select Settings menu under the dot channel view : settings
the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed with which a song will play . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so you can change the pace of a song . so if you find for example , a song is too fast , to follow the text , you can slow@@ down it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . thus , the same MIDI file on two different devices can lead to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way .
good , I can force anybody to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change a similar sound quality . at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , De@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; which happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we @-@ support was compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source code and install ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; Home )
I would like to add an entire folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
do not agree , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; mid ; window .
simply enable the adjustment of automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection .
you can insert the arrow @-@ button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD bed to slow down the reproduction . click on the default speed click on the LCD double @-@ double .
I have been playing on a &amp; D ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file @-@ file ) or if I want to play a file , merely in the &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; window change and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; mi@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ -@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so make the setting of automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ IE your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then do you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me so on &amp; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I am in the third year , so I don &apos;t have much time to take time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a little time . as Hob@@ bies I have programming , MIDI files collect , make music and prove propositions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want to make a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ ver@@ .@@ es
you really make a great pleasure for me to send me a postcard from your location or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file by a local group , I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file . before you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might already have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I would like to get out of it for money . I therefore want to stress that I &apos;m just about getting feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - rec@@ ti@@ fying the error , that the pitch was too high at A@@ we cards .
thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for the test of the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia , Marc Die@@ fen@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us pepper , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , notified or even only a supportive email .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid , can be found on his homepage , which can be found at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ don@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can trace the development , look and look at pictures . you can also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer , because the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or an A@@ we card .
if you do not have sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could have a sound card , except that you can of course listen to music .
if any problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; cc@@ us ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used for playing video files that supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on formats , as well as playing DVD , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help , please send the KDE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there are always windows with the playlist . and finally there is a window window , which will be displayed only if information is displayed in it .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are played after each other , so you should use the category of permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you click an entry , his group and all its sub @-@ groups are copied to the current category and play@@ back begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also by using the application . simply click on a name of a category C@@ utter that appears from the menu view and next processing mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this section is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlist , and either selected the editing mode , or selected another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode leave or another group will be selected without the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; some features can be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can simply be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during the start doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically ended by opening another source . this would however disturbing the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation may be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ ise &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file &quot; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gif &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ ts ; in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL will be supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path can be set from the M@@ et and the intermediate storage size from the disk and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&apos; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages can reproduce , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ IME type 1 / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the furnishings dialog file access of KDE are specified .
the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is displayed in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library library . the gest@@ ated process is cris@@ p . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to consider ) .
thus getting a pre @-@ determined back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime @-@ type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on is to reproduce all og@@ g files :
&amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked like , the scanner can be configured from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data Rek@@ order ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is used in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there , ports should be selected , one of which is selected for use ( for example , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B included in it .
since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this type of play@@ back of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ pro@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server therefore must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) .
internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , this dv@@ dn@@ av@@ source , dv@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they begin with the play@@ back of the playlist .
are there hints as I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM is to run as user root after installing the device . it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / CD@@ ROM indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
X@@ ine only starts slowly , why does each time my CPU has to be tested on their performance ?
note : the answer is super@@ se@@ d. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time will check the CPU .

most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be included .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further compile and are on the ki@@ le ; website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users probably need to read this manual again . however , all suggestions for documentation must be considered . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact information should be made about the ki@@ le ; website .
if you have any questions or regarding the compile of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or become extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; l@@ atex ; facilities available in a graphical interface and within these a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . additionally , the easy to use , compile , editing , and view tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and to experience his possibilities should bring out the manual to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter of work with the editor of &amp; Kate .

the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a complete function for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; . selecting the document ( menu ) provides some ways to create the document . it can also be made some to the document related settings .
documentation : this is hereby the type of document printed document : article ( article ) , book &#91; text &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; S@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Report ( DIN ) &#91; official &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; be@@ amer &#93; or customized .

new users now have no worries . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the inc@@ ess@@ ation of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . thanks to &amp; ki@@ le ; a simple problem @-@ looking text is not closed . however , it is likely to be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will be saving you by passing time and the heat .

La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; thus , the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most common and subtle element ) :
in the view of the document in struc@@ turing , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click on the respective device .
when creating one &apos;s own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful over the file . as soon as a DV@@ I ; file &#91; recorded file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ay File ) &#93; , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; through a click with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; viewer on the appropriate line in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code .
a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format document and also other information like the font and is adjacent to PDF the her@@ edi@@ tary output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; . there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and operators .
when using the rates , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor is shortened and as soon as an element in the DV@@ I ; file is cli@@ cked , becomes the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was shortened , becomes the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ;
master @-@ Document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other included .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master @-@ document can be set up project settings .
quick : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
file Gender : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file is used on the current n@@ der@@ og@@ â , in the case , and it does not take a call by &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; after the screening .
in case of viewing the tool@@ bar , the three positions should be stri@@ pped . the selection fields have been developed for the fast influ@@ x of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid link@@ age of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field Fur@@ ther forms part of articles such as tags , fox , notes or references . the items are available :
name : with this command a term is created for a section , an image or other element .
reference : is used for the reference to a fixed name ( selection above a selection field ) .
when using quotation , a selection list is displayed with literary ones . for the editing of &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le by hand .
the last drop @-@ field with the name gr@@ anny will be used for defining the font , for the main text , the Fu@@ els notes , etc . there are the following fon@@ ts :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , there are two choices : 1 . the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and determining settings . 2. The document can be written from scratch .
the brack@@ ets according to the \ \ &apos; s command include the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has to be entered , the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do is the usage of the construction or the button of Quick bau .
the source code must be stored in front of the compile . &amp; ki@@ le ; the storage is automatically saved .
display the compile of the document , should be searched in the protocol for the errors . when using quick @-@ speed , &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be observed .
an environment ( English . environment ) is a text that is different from the remainder of the document . for example , a report with the font should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ HU@@ GE and \ \ into { environment } .
the changes are used only within the environment ( from \ \ to { environment } to \ \ &apos; { environment } ) .
there are many ways to get the read@@ ability of the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it allows for example certain types of fon@@ ts , fla@@ vor@@ ings , blood pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . , these commands finish either with the \ \ \ &apos; command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of course and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a \ \ &apos; { recep@@ tive } or another environment . a single word in one set can be recur@@ sively shown with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
once the background is presented to the letter of the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; recording language , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; .
once upon the assistant a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . there@@ for , there should be a quotation , a few places in the fat and spa pressure , and a poem to see the differences of these commands .
once the document is viewed , it can be returned to the Editor via Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ E ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its windows must be closed .
once the DV@@ I ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file . simply try and have fun .
DV@@ I ; is a small @-@ day file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ay ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script . / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screen monitors .
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - it can be printed in print ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin into the tool@@ bar using the buttons in tool@@ bar .
look for the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DV@@ I ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ binary files . there must be only modern under settings Ki@@ le set up ... tools building .
to search for the preliminary search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned at one line of the source code , and must be attached to the corresponding position in the DV@@ I ; the viewer takes place at the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; closed and ki@@ le ; in &amp; oc@@ ular ; as text editor set ( settings oc@@ ular up ... Editor )
should in the use of fast @-@ speed of the &amp; DV@@ I ; the viewer will not be a mistake . if a bug is available , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary .
the log file will be the error source in the source code . in the editor you can see the kno@@ wh@@ istle error messages and N@@ Ã ¶ ff La@@ Te@@ X errors to view the error message . to view the error message , must be cli@@ cked to the error in the log file and ki@@ le ; jump to the error on the error .
once a window is cli@@ cked in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose from the template for the document .
selecting an empty document can either be written either from scratch or use the assistant to quickly create a new document . more information can be included in the section .
overall users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to nearly all documents . assists can be done in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either create an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file size or a new file will be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of document templates .
when creating a new document from a new document , some strings by other data will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or string code ) . these variables can set up in settings Ki@@ le ... settings General .
when creating a template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ O@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; s class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ CLA@@ SS@@ O@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the Assist@@ ants and the related commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps have been accomplished :
when creating a new document , its own template , instead of the standard , can be washed out .
a template can be created from any of any l@@ atex ; files will be created . if a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and the steps described under the steps described above .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor of many different kinds of text files ( including also &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; can be done in the menu , directly out &amp; ki@@ le ;
to learn more &amp; Kate ; and his ways of experience should experience the manual to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter of work with the editor of &amp; Kate .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command preference , which can be viewed via the menu help La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find a detailed description of nearly all the commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be found as well as their syn@@ tax .
a double @-@ click with dr@@ unken Str@@ g button to dump the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way the click on \ \ par of \ \ o \ &apos; s merely \ \ par .
when pulling the text with proper lin@@ ker mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow @-@ edge with penetr@@ ated Shift key , parts of the source code can be ej@@ ected in the editing window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the opportunity to browse different types of source texts and emphasize this . for example , the lo@@ l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants may arise from our book@@ marks . this is about one &apos;s own way of book@@ marks within the text . the menu is highlighted the jump to the most difficult or last spr@@ ing@@ mark . thereby , this jumping mark is highlighted , so that it will automatically convert the jump at the initial input of a character .
working is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; Kate ; already excellent facilities for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; source text added ; special orders for their selection . under conversion , the following commands contain text code :
w@@ ns a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank line ) . with a paragraph there is not a text with transparent lines ( like in other text dit@@ ors ) . these advanced mean@@ ings coinci@@ des with the tables , l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of source code . thus , the only bent thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is therefore that the question separated by two blank lines are separated .
the word under the current Cur@@ tains position . this selection also has an advanced meaning since this command also l@@ atex ; commands with an un@@ finished star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to present a part of this document may naturally be removed , and by wir@@ ing the key can be removed . &amp; Kate ; offers the key@@ word C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the following commands to convert the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to work @-@ in paragraph .
it has already been interpreted to play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for more commands under Be@@ work environment for an easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; .
with this command will jump in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the command to the main attraction of the environment .
with this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the command to the locker and the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , is inj@@ ected to the end of the area ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many flo@@ wered , commands , the command can quickly be lost . this command stop the last surrounding , so that the wast@@ e@@ water structure will not be destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups , which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under Be@@ work Te@@ X group are some important commands , those of the working environment correspond .
this command is inj@@ ected to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the sound@@ ing clothes .
this command is inj@@ ected to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right behind the beaten gorge .
if the cursor is before or behind the wei@@ ghed bond of a &amp; tex ; group # , is inj@@ ected to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
in the input of many swal@@ lowed groups @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps , one can quickly drop the eye view . this command slept in the last group , so that the sp@@ elled structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups will not be dis@@ missed .
in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used two easy annex@@ ation signs at &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two easy annex@@ ation signs is used . also for the purpose of the application , the sign &quot; is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; already knows this case and for two inter@@ locking points suitable for &amp; l@@ atex ; a .
this automatic exterior of double pi@@ erc@@ ing marks can set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and ex@@ termin@@ ated .
many other languages can also be used ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French . there are also many other languages available .
for the wir@@ ing of Shift ; input button , &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent poin@@ ter . if the current position is placed within a lists ( such as en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) , for example the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or item@@ ize ) .
within a tables environment , t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an remaining poin@@ ter .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ cri@@ b &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support them .
some users like to arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t signs ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; sought and ki@@ le ; after the most beautiful tab@@ ulator in the next line . even though this t@@ ulator is not the associated ; some intermediate space for the Colum@@ ns position of the current table .
although &amp; Kate ; already offers a good source code effect , it was installed in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) still extended . there are three different modes available for automatic comp@@ osing . all these modes can be set up for different modes of working under settings Ki@@ le ... dis@@ continued .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ , { surroundings } becomes &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically added to the \ \ &apos; environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
with the wir@@ ing button , the last character of the input will be removed and may be gri@@ pped the complete list . on the other hand , the list by entering another letter can also be reduced .
all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , descriptions are of@@ ten@@ ly written by selecting a command . alternatively , you can also start jumping into these positions by means of the spr@@ ing@@ le jump brand and the desired parameters can be shipped .
among settings ki@@ le ; set ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made for these lists . it may be different kinds of options for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands as well as whales of the general language used to use .
the command mode is for the execution of environments not n@@ ish . there are always a few letters with \ \ &apos; to be entered and the call of the installation process will have a large list with ambient temperatures . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the sub@@ missions of the environment .
when calling the installation process , the entire management system or the key @-@ key Alt + Shift key @-@ button is automatically de@@ fied the command to the end of the environment and it appears \ \ . after that , the environment has continued on the easiest way and can be completed by ur@@ ging the input button .
once this has been accomplished , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le , det@@ ects that it is a list of environment , even a first \ \ item command .
under settings ki@@ le ; set ... ki@@ le ; complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the full list of version mode for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supporting user @-@ defined lists of tow@@ ing , which can be replaced immediately by number Ki@@ le strings . as an example of a bi@@ z@@ oning list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X file is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word comple@@ mentary mode : the menu is introduced , the code was introduced , the letter A L is replaced with the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
big wh@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ nden are not helpful . however , that many whales in a document can be written more than once . thus it offers &amp; ki@@ le ; complete cancellation for all already written documents .
this mode can set up in the menu Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ complete . here you can also specify the swelling for the display of completion .
the authorized files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / p / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen Home @-@ folder . mode is for the application ( abor@@ tion ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ ear@@ r@@ ter@@ book ) or tex .
the dialogue graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible . to monitor the bases on the Graphi@@ cs , the sections should be observed and observed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the implementation and re@@ arrangement of pages . if the PDF output is published , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script file ; it will be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to watch the results of work , the source code must be compiled . all components are group@@ ed in the menu creation , creating conversion and creating view .
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ ep@@ ie@@ ce ; or the further transformation can be used by pressing forces ; 2 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file is converted into a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file are considered .
when using the command @-@ speed , normally a viewer is called after the compile @-@ lift . should not be used by a connected viewer , each one gets a new window each time .
a new project will be presented to the project on the project . here , the following information is asked for the project :
in the case of the file name window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the instructor to be managed by EC@@ MA@@ Script -@@ Ko@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the slot list .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; even more .
first of all , it must be said that the application environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; l@@ atex ; is a quite large system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of extra packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the operator .
&amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . in this includes a documentation for the included packages and another l@@ atex ; reference .
a complete refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and its e@@ â , &quot; Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â &quot; indicates , it is a complete manual for the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands contain and thus is ideal for the search for a particular format@@ ting . as this is a very large document , it will be divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , the final document is not always easy . as a possible help , &amp; t@@ et@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that contains a database with all to &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and available for a graphic torso .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package name or impact . from &amp; ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or the appropriate space for the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; source code for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix systems available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix systems is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS X @-@ X .
much thanks to those who seek to continue the &amp; ki@@ le ; project aim and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools we can all use under consideration of the &amp; GNU / GNU / license .

everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ k ; -@@ documentation has already worked pro@@ c and how long it is . do we lift it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the symbol for the XML processor and ready !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the tigh@@ tened work folder , then remove the current work folder . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and insert it in the field of other folder the desired folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are dropped each time if said pro@@ c .
as I said , each of the at the &amp; k@@ k ; -@@ documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphic interface for that .
if the straight @-@ opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then they just leave the current work folder . if not , then select current work folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is wrong . please check the errors and try again .
if the veri@@ fiable file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then you can easily delete the current file . if not , delete it from current file the tick and select the file to be veri@@ fiable from other files - file sel@@ ections .
if they just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection .
for the use of a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; ( Internal ) , select &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and enter the location of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( Internal ) , and for the Relax@@ NG review is required in file sel@@ ector .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the editing file in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already be marked , then they leave the current file simply selected . if not , remove the selection of current file and select the file to be processed via the other file format .
specify the name of the file as the result is to be named , the file is usually stored in your local folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have taken place with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plugin system very powerful . you can get from the added functionality immediately and do not wait until someone can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements that can be found below .
to install a plugin , or a part , we start working with the menu plug@@ ins . this will open the following dialogue :
this dialog allows to manage all the contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of the plug @-@ ins .
often work on one project several individuals in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can look out from the list of members of the team who he is . this happens by searching the team member from the list and press the button . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nickname and setup of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information regarding comments .
apart from an overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be an event for information on the team managers when something is happening . see in more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens . an example would be drawing up of the aper@@ tures and lock@@ up of the project , so that later someone is working on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script to add a file to CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialo@@ gs can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the addres@@ see of selected addres@@ see . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i will be established such leaders .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following items :
input notes is simple . it can either selected the note file from the editor @-@ context menu or the @ b@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary box followed by Com@@ ment text .
comments can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case the syn@@ tax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby the nickname of the nickname of team member states should be played by the relevant Di@@ x@@ - or Sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nickname and roll names are independent of large or small size , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the comment invali@@ d .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ T@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supported web@@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up by settings of Qu@@ anta . Th@@ es@@ thood extends over a few pages that are treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car understanding , can be changed . the entries are :
large / bil@@ tho@@ graphy of tags : large / small @-@ case of automatically inser@@ ts tags . normal young / re@@ bel means , the tags are inserted as inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / d@@ tho@@ graphy of attributes : big / small @-@ case of automatically arranged attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ cript means , the attributes are added as inserted as described in the days XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the subsequent day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; added .
not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags using the exception of the simple tags .
start and finish @-@ tag automatically update : if enabled , the corresponding subsequent day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic detection of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters in corresponding enco@@ ding during inser@@ ting .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ e@@ types for the detection of different types of files . using the button standard , the standard programs can be restored .
standard drawing : the coding of newly created or in other ways than using file opening files ( where the coding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting will be released from the same in the project states if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D was not recognized . but this setting will be released from the same in the project states if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that with a power out@@ age or crash at the next launch of the program the document can be restored by this backup . it &apos;s not the same as saving the file . even for any stored documents a backup is generated regularly , according to the time issued .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Edi@@ ton area or one &apos;s view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to see the documentation , pre@@ views and the source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the standard back next to the next start is useful when the user interface has arrived by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command parameters .
the warning message area serves the tax of opportunity to switch ad by warnings from cont@@ esting pat@@ ties with no more inquiries .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ isation behavior of the V@@ PL@@ E and the source code view in the shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document , are set in detail .
in the area of mouse click on the structural tree causes the following action , it is possible to change the action by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structural tree @-@ settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be automatically opened in the tree , the actu@@ alisation of the tree in the tree and how deep during a change of structural tree should be automatically opened . empty knot@@ s are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such , where in the current document there is no element found .
the area for completion of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be valid for working on extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are available in groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ end bot@@ tling is different than in one group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ able application , the most known &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; . in case of a plug @-@ ins , the following shall be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
input : this information is handed over to the plugin when starting , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
component in &quot; read @-@ read &quot; mode : check whether the plug @-@ in is denied the shop . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts , usually refuse the shop when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : is this activated , then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the plug @-@ in information is correct , then , when the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the debu@@ gger was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger has been adjusted , as well as the support for the db@@ g debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows different implement@@ ations over plug @-@ ins .
currently , only a plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug in the project settings . using the button options next to the debu@@ gger plug @-@ in , the specific settings may be changed .
when a debu@@ gger activ@@ ates for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the contents of surveillance variables is displayed . usually appears in the left @-@ left dock .
a view in which all the holding points , with drawing numbers and conditions are listed . normally , normally in the lower gu@@ dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is displayed . normally in the lower gu@@ dock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the debu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , to lau@@ re@@ ate requests . this action is triggered by default , when a project is used , which does not need to be respected in the normal case .
the counter@@ part at debu@@ gging session Star@@ te the session . close the link to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the l@@ ull after requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this request is shown in the debu@@ gger display .
indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start and information on the monitoring variables as well as the currently performed line continuously . if this happens , the execution will continue . happens before a debit claim has been started , the script starts with the request .
indicates the debu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start using without information on surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens , the execution runs on . happens , before a debit claim has been given , the execution starts when a request is placed .
the debu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or includes .
the debu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script , whereby it is possible to error in functions and includes error .
indicates the debu@@ gger , the directive to move and to the next so as if there wouldn &apos;t be the current one .
opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , that is to be monitored . the a@@ woke value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable entered or set up a new value of variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs and how you can find &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are made in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for Mark@@ ab@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as CSS ; to provide skills and flexibility , easy , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web @-@ creation , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the tag folder and the tool . day @-@ folder contain two data types , the tag folder and des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files to insert images ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , the text and instructions faster into a document than one user could ever have .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ tools . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the equity dialo@@ gs , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even tool tools allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without danger of a writing .
tag files are nothing but folder . they contain only the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day @-@ folder bear the name of the spelling language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the day XML and declares that it is necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limitations will be revealed in a simple way .
this is the root element of a day XML document . it can only happen once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself otherwise .
the type of tag is a script function . when it is used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class type is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type meth@@ od is valid . there is the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has an Commons Attri@@ bution group and the attributes of this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag is determined . this is a only element type item .
describes an attribute of a tag . this item can only happen once for any attribute . it puts the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags , which should be described as this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type item .
are the source codes used for filling the attributes in the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in the attribute tree .
source = d@@ co@@ p requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used for the achievement of the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a methodology name . the arguments to be passed to the method can be empty or % tag , this means the name of the current tag .
a container day that is group@@ ed by the elements of a list . it can occur for an attribute only once . it is a only element type item .
sets the position of the attribute of a tags within a dialogue . this day can occur for any attribute in a dialogue only once ( for example for each one ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty .
indicates a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is a just element type .
returns a list of elements that will finish a day . this element is a just element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ Dec@@ ision : ? XML version = 1.0 _ vent = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and need to be properly gre@@ ased and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; b ; signs . these should be done by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; know especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tool is dialog at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear , whose simple instructions is to follow .
this function is currently not available . at present , the check only takes place at the shop of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file one &amp; PHP ; Over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; function = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; status = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be edited by D@@ T@@ D . thus , the des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a re @-@ des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries to be created :
&#91; general &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as Nick@@ name .
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click new action leads to the same dialog :
this action is wei@@ ghted key@@ plate . with clicking the button user interface , a key @-@ abbrevi@@ ation can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current button @-@ abbrevi@@ ation can be removed .
the simplest actions . it can be entered into a detailed settings in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . by using this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or to use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Schnell@@ start @-@ Dialogue or the different See in ... campaigns for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter should be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ scripts . sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting you variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / p / qu@@ anta / badge in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H / scripts / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H It provides other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file , file is removed from the document name .
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above can be a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; at the default input may be determined , what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the document selected will be sent to the script . the % input is usually required only with this approach .
according to the input can also be re@@ directed to the output of the specified application . there are two types of issue : normal edition , written to the default output ; error messages , to which the default output is to be done , by default the drop @-@ down output is set :
if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar named the name of the mark@@ ups .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add and configure actions . select settings actions .
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the day attributes has and you plan their use , enable dialogue to call &quot; Edit &quot; when available , so that an input will be possible when the action is possible .
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we replace it before we have difficulties .
for creating a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used standard 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Be@@ work size next .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a startup kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green , mostly interpreted as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that An@@ y this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start to insert this symbol in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text field , one button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
keep the user button and continue using any other tags , so there is still , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to complement some standard &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should be set to a better overview of several separ@@ ating into several groups . make sure to set the tool@@ bar set to tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected .
I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( very left up ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , the tool@@ bar is to be added , press the arrow @-@ button to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add tool@@ bar .
please be aware of how the separation can support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button the opposite of the start @-@ button .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot;
secure in the correct folder . after re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be used in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please match its tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened by the relevant type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; repository Check if anyone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you have to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is up to you , the second we treat here .
# KDE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; reply = path , relative to this file , to the document@@ ations HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # items in the main index file = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 2 = = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html &gt; Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html &gt; Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html ( 1 = = .1 html , 2 = = .1 html tag 1 = tag 2.@@ html , day = tag@@ 2.@@ html , day 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in PHP &amp; PHP , such as something :
# KDE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top item = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = Rec@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Basic syn@@ tax , ... Basic syn@@ tax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ ax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in a tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the chec@@ kers ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you can notice that the content directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and in consequence on the top end of the Bau@@ man@@ tra &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything but make sure to &amp; b &amp; b ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; b ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources are replaced .
the stage section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context menu ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file connection .
a simple list of by sub@@ tly separate context elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / doc / InterBase / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR
if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be wealthy but proud to have worked on the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the waste resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email menu item , such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail send , tool@@ bar , and folders in templates and scripts in the scripts .
the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download it . the contributions are checked and only made available to publish a user , where there is a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked about their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private GP@@ G keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys you can choose one . in dialogue New resource you have to stay out the input fields ( URL preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the high @-@ load will be started .
the high @-@ load can be loaded from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar top @-@ load , and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templ@@ ar and scripts that can be started .
after downloading a resource , nor before the installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource is warning through testing the integrity and signature . in case of problems , it can be dis@@ continued . if the integrity given and the resource correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the origin@@ ator of the resource .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it will be time to work by adding a D@@ TE@@ P package . it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files in days XML format could be necessary . there is the easiest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D store and conver@@ sions a D@@ T@@ D . select the .@@ dt@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which is to be used . then , the following dialog appears :
target lists : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / p / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definitions : the string that appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , like HTML Public / / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ dt@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after transforming the &amp; des@@ crip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are a few key concepts . to be able to understand these and get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first introduce these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
global elements are reserved for everyone , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . it enables the group of administrators to secure different tool , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool @-@ tool . local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ based elements are available only within a particular project . this can be everything from a certain project . simply , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tors window , the building views , the lo@@ dges and the tool@@ ing . please suggest you in , and for further information on these areas .
you can click the card @-@ mouse with the right mouse button to get a text @-@ click menu with the current document illustrated contracts , such as closing the current , other or all cart@@ els , re@@ charging , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Edi@@ tor@@ f lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste / paste ) to edit the file under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , if the string is referred to under the mouse cursor .
at the top end of the Edi@@ tor@@ f you find the tool@@ bar of the Edi@@ tors . currently , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional als standard to provide for which a set of tool@@ bar is shown . in the course of the further construction of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool @-@ tools are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bar is really easy . if they want to insert a simple tag , then click on the icon that represents the day . now , you can insert the data for this just finished tag . if you want to insert a tag , which has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction prospects ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , to open and pass through . in the presentation with Kart@@ ing lo@@ dges are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation components .
project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; preparations . this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , removal , up@@ loading or dele@@ tion of files from storage media can be performed with the displayed context menu .
another option of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . nearly everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . it will be open to you all possibilities .
assists can be divided into three categories , depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding users and assists in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is found in .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking on the right mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script , as for example the script to start , process or send an email .
with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through links @-@ click of an element the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her in the tree .
this tree appears among the other building views . with it , man@@ ic@@ able attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . based on the content of a contract , the change of all available attributes with a few clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development . it can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site to create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and considered .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cardboard slip at the bottom of the window , can be achieved using the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window .
this card rider provides information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . this way , for example , the D@@ T@@ D used by the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D display .
this card rider indicates all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so it gives ) to this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool @-@ tools are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive above &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure these in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has to be handed over to the configure script . to get a complete list of options available to the configure script . / configure --@@ help file . the options are simple to understand and do not run here .
if you have problems with starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H is located in front of her bin folder .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the KDE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; became optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engine@@ ered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers began to deal with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a separate , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages would be ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; be the appropriate &amp; IDE .
well , to the above claim needs to be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of Why do anyone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Sc@@ aff@@ old is not only it possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity nearly every task . through the Com@@ prehen@@ sive actions , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , without having to notice a scrip@@ ting language tax . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Re@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and rapidly expanded into a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Equ@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; plus the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more deta@@ iling documentation is using help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or k@@ help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) .

a quick @-@ term list of files you have opened . this list changed every time you open a file , which is not located , where the oldest entry is taken .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . take a look at the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project device , only a bug will be reported .
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to &amp; HTML ; pronoun@@ cement , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a form of format@@ ting .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; a prescription that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; first and foremost to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor tag .
switch the block selection or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &quot; Shift key . &quot;
go directly to a row number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP does give error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions in order to help you .
displays the news window or not to it . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
initial and switching of the problem @-@ problem on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated once you change the structure tree .
displays the symbols left from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ s@@ ors in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the .@@ web@@ pr@@ j file .
presents a dialog to paste files into the current project . the selected files are then copied in the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows e.g. to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add it to the project .
load the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; off and whether you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project managed . in Chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars and are only installed in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates just the name . actions must be used by setting settings ... and tool can be stored for tool@@ ing tool , or you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
removes a tool@@ bar from the visual range . the tool@@ bar doesn &apos;t delete it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you are asked if you want to do that .
you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu @-@ menu opens a new E@@ Mail message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment .
allows to upload tool to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; that you or anything else has done and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
download / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when En@@ ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew the entire &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a write @-@ off in the global KDE folder does not exist , the shop fails .
this menu contains a list of tags you are available in the current tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is in the tags menu a sub @-@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day setup dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this will only work with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent incorpor@@ ation means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the inser@@ tion using tool@@ bar refused , if this day goes to the rules on this place .
in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the stated menu items . click here . click on the activated @-@ ins de@@ activ@@ ates .
select the Syn@@ cut@@ out mode for the current file . the list of available reductions schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version available .
select the type of poin@@ ter identification . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for development . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh .
checks the syn@@ tax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D system ; through its external application .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some restrictions in the KDE libraries , switching sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics can cause . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the lower window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes an entry for every open window window . by selecting a tra@@ der , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switch the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog , any application that use the HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser .
align the behavior of the editing pane . in the documentation of &amp; Kate ; you will find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bar , or which ones and the rows will follow .
this should generate a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor , but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find here the way .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled out in the best from top to bottom , because after filling out the project called all the directory @-@ structure for the rest of the project , all these paths and author information fields can be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features .
here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering names , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension of web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you have the server address of the machine to which you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ examples ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 ) are possible .
if one leaves this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocols are used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder in which the templates will be stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and standard templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , that folder should be set instead of standard .
this is the folder in which tool@@ bars can be saved for the project . it is a rel@@ ational path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , that folder should be set instead of standard .
this allows to include files from the local file system into the project . you can choose multiple files or whole folder .
this setting is great when you have st@@ static we@@ bin@@ ars you want to download and change . by case @-@ in script running ( e.g. &amp; PHP , , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
when files are stored somewhere in the project folder , if files , which are to be involved somewhere in the project folder . if a project is started on a new one , not an@@ ha@@ ken .
this option will display all the files and folders within the folder and you can make an exact choice of di@@ lution .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by sei@@ zur@@ es or , by removing the tick , cl@@ inging from the project .
the last screen of the new project @-@ assist@@ ants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings may be updated in the menu with project project properties in the sub @-@ window profiles in the sub@@ window profiles , or with the keyboard Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project @-@ assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ card possible ) , which can be rec@@ ol@@ ored in project @-@ related operations like project folders .
supple@@ mentary option to the top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view that is loaded at the opening of the project . in order to be read more about project views .
thus the debu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the debu@@ gger plug can be set with the button Options . in this case , the debu@@ gger can be described .
in the sub@@ window profiles , upload files ( see in ) can be adjusted , as well as the display of a site view for the content of the server for each profile , showing your own construction view for each profile .
in the context @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the under @-@ window configuration , you can turn off event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions . events actions are executed when a previous event occurs , such as the Si@@ ghting of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not currently be influenced .
to open another project , choose a project ... from the project project or the Symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will occur . the same happens when you load a new project .
project overview gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folder behave as well , but the entries are missing open and opening with ... within the right mouse @-@ click context menu :
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loading files .
allows the removal of the current profile . if only more one profile is present , the button is be@@ wil@@ dered to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the cache and will be forgotten by program@@ ing . this possibility is useful if common up@@ loading files is needed and the rather un@@ secure password stored on the record -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the flood .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ profile profiles can be created and thus up@@ loaded the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when working or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a full qualified domain name or IP @-@ address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs can choose .
the port for transfer . usually this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk so it can not be read simply , but everyone with programming experience can be easily seen in plain text .
a project view is just a set files and tool . it can give in one project many views , i.e. by simply exchange of view , various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool .
views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ ing tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best to be able to perform the tool@@ bar menu . use and add @-@ up to the tool@@ bar is treated below in the section tool@@ bar .
the tool@@ bar and the symbols can either be set up using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which a new tool@@ bar can remove , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar , which leads to dialogue where actions can be visible on this or other tool .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , additionally the entries will remove action and operate the action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool @-@ tools and the actions on them can set up in the menu with setting options ... and settings actions can be set .
assists are essentially document@@ aries , code car@@ vings and files for links . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used basically like a common fil@@ esystem , with exp@@ and@@ able organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or paste each other to the system available in the previous tree ; assists in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the fil@@ esystem .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template used before using accurately .
Bin@@ z is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( such as pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the preliminary tree under global templates . additional information on the Templ@@ ar tree is available in .
documents can be created by any text document . based on these templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple rum@@ or for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the preliminary tree under global templates . see in for more information about the templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not included a new document based on a template , but the same text area again and again into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or per@@ l . some examples are available in the preliminary tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
as the name says , these Templ@@ ates for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a comp@@ ress tar archive . at present , there are no examples in brack@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
design a document structure after exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select the file as a template save as a local template ....
once that has been done , you notice that ( even if it is stored as a project situation ) the template is not visible in the project tree . check in the pre @-@ tree tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click on file as a template store as a local / project situation . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and deri@@ ving on the designs .
the creation of binary templates is simple : to copy the file only into a single folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pulling and desc@@ ends or paste the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files to create a name for the template and secure . by default , the project folder is secured , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project boards allow a very target @-@ oriented proceeding . you can put head@@ line and foot@@ er or dynamic with a PHP , design , insert files or link with them . additionally you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound .
the template structure in the basement windows is based on the files listed in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / p / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
to set the behaviour of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and in the context @-@ menu properties to choose . the following dialog appears :
a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is deduc@@ ted as soon as El@@ ter@@ licher Attri@@ bute verb@@ ank is ha@@ iled .
this is enabled by default and fits to everything except the stem cell . if a regular folder would basically disable , unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular folder .
allows a set @-@ up or presented text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ line or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ notes .
in addition , you have the right @-@ click menu ( click to show right mouse button ) about a full command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that shares via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code in two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and one cursor . then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that includes &amp; PHP , shows a small green symbol the V@@ oh@@ and@@ un@@ ision of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor , the source code is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first , except that simultaneously the changes both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor will be visible , this mode is already active , the touch will shift the active cue from one window to the other , where the position is kept in the document .
the synchron@@ isation dialog between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code editor allows you to choose between V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in the selection automatically the price can be adjusted in addition to time . in principle , the recommendation is : a small Span@@ ne for fast computer and a large garage for slow .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , the tool@@ ing features will be used . the document characteristics will also be called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; it is used as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this will help the reduction of the suspension code . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a @-@ tags permit the storage of information about the document itself such as keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click in the list allows the amendment to the content such as key words on the column name and key@@ word key word verb@@ t@@ 2 on the content -@@ column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is exactly as with the met@@ a elements . working of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and select the appropriate file .
the use of the cur@@ s@@ ors is as possible in a text processing , due to moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the C@@ ursor works as usual . text can be inserted through typ@@ ing and deleted using set@@ back or removing .
the inser@@ tion of tags will be made in the same way via tool@@ ing , such as in the source code editor . it is noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , any other orbit@@ ing anchor will be removed .
some tool@@ ing such as the tables @-@ assistant or lists assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work in this release must be used the tables or lists of tool .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examination of sty@@ mi@@ xes . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the style situation can be trac@@ ed .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; still the libraries are li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .

there are many graphic tools for comparisons . why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merger was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ory had made many changes and at the same time corrected many places the inser@@ tion . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result were numerous conflicts with the result .
the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I couldn &apos;t see what changed exactly within these lines . and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the re @-@ set@@ back had changed . this change was a small nightmare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences within a row and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features were added .
for example , if you want to compare fast text , just copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparative window .
one function that did a lot of work was the same and together of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ together is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to solve conflict and shows at the same time the result in an anticipated result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; will also help you with the comparisons and complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ together :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences in and serve out the possibilities of current colour inv@@ isi@@ es . if you need frequently check code , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can look at a look at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble any more , if Yemen and the desc@@ endant will change . )
when a file is equal and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means both files differ .
if all files are the same name , but in different folders , then you can ease the ti@@ pping work by complete the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder @-@ 2 folder @-@ 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 @-@ o target folders
open dialog allows you to type in file name , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last modified file from the list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences will be performed with two files .
over the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you choose a folder , the comparisons between B and C however is a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
if together , the input field is active for target and can be dealt with . however , it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later on saving .
the plug @-@ in button opens up a dialogue with settings . here you can set options before starting with the comparisons .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in open dialog , you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the inter@@ rupt button .
you can also drag and remove them : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
which thought is behind it ? sometimes , a file contains such functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , this would be a relatively large effort . you would only need to create two appropriate files , load it into &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then download the relevant sections simply copy , paste and then compare .
note : currently , you cannot draw anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drag the text into a former window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and deri@@ ving of text into another program than cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the row number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is op@@ tionally ) . ( if the path to a file is too long , the mouse will drop a while above the line . then a small aid window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is recognized , one sees in the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the pre @-@ introduced color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( together ) to see .
links next to the text is the compilation column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line that separates the coll@@ isions @-@ column from the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the row break is activated , the line is displayed in broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison table ) has also an info line with the output issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; ... &#93; when you edit the result . usually it contains by the automatic composite already text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the storing is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons are to be found in the context of the un@@ resolved conflict in order to find even remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison belts are used , each difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ( this will also be a jump of the position in the windows , where the start of the group would otherwise be highlighted . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left is a black gir@@ der .
sometimes there is no more row in the group , or by manual editing , no more row is left in the column ; then this text is only a wild@@ card for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er you might copy and elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; compilation of conflicts ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if selecting the sources the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs .
navig@@ ating navig@@ ates mainly with the scroll bar and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow @-@ end , bottom , bottom , shr@@ ub off and shr@@ ub , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . the Excel column next to the vertical frame bar can also be used for navigation .
in the Au@@ ctions window you can also use the other keys to work . with the insert button you can switch between inser@@ ting and over@@ hau@@ l mode . ( default is the plug @-@ in mode ) .
one click with the left mouse button in one of the sub@@ mit@@ ter column synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as mentioned in the section ) and the edi@@ table output window was explained ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ below ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture Ab@@ ward ) or the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ Picture Ab@@ ward ) or the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below ) or the next / previous conflict , continue to resolve as a conflict . therefore , between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be made .
to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the Cop@@ y button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and drop the manual copying . be careful with this option but you could acci@@ dentally over@@ see the content of the cli@@ p@@ board .
foref@@ athers are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors will use a line @-@ love character \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use Wagen@@ re @-@ shoe \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 keeps the drawing of the source files not with , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; neither with binary files .
the options and the list of the last used files are automatically saved when running automatically and restored to the next launch . ( menu registered - &gt; K@@ lin@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialog also includes writings with variable width to choose from , you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are presented in short text . if the chosen script does not support this presentation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be shown ast@@ ast@@ ed . on these systems the button preferences automatically introduces a odd color .
when this option is activated , when pressing the Tab@@ ulator key , the appropriate number of spaces is inserted . otherwise , a sp@@ readsheet character is inserted .
if you want to enter or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next row .
if enabled , each selection will be copied automatically to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual is dropped into the cli@@ p@@ board .
you can select which poin@@ ter type to be saved . the pres@@ et value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
at the same files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files can be found . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step is compar@@ es white signs . in this step , white signs are not ignored . white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart &apos; \ \ &apos; and a poin@@ ter &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others again store only a line @-@ like &apos; \ &apos; . usually , if this option is activated , the cars are treated with different sizes , however , like a white sign . during that this option has to be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the outcome , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters .
intensively looking for some smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in Autom@@ atic res@@ ign mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
trig@@ gers automatic all conflicts in white characters , using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful when white signs are less important for all un@@ resolved white conflicts . if you are only considering that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapters to scan folders and Imple@@ mentation . see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and inter@@ acting .
when a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version is attached the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already there is already a back @-@ file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup .
the language of the user interface adap@@ ts . changing this option does not account the current current programme . you must finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change will be active . ( this option is set in the KDE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is globally across the control center . )
the following enco@@ ders can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you activate this option , it will be used for all entries the upper setting .
about the selection fields for coding appears a short reference , which is local code . ( this cannot be changed here and it &apos;s purely informal character . )
adjust the file code for swelling files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the coding for each file is individually adjusted , even files can be compared and assembled with different enco@@ ding .
if you have processed a file , you can specify which coding is to be used for storing .
if you define pre @-@ processing orders you could not function with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the warran@@ t command can only be done with 8 @-@ bit A@@ SC@@ II . ) With this option , you can specify the coding of the output of machine vision commands .
turn off in order to sub@@ vert he@@ aps of changes in the text or a review split . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . however , you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . according to selecting A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; b ; -@@ lock ; C or B &amp; b ; -@@ lock ; C is shown beside the normal yet a second super @-@ face column with the required information .
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . simply complete the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
orders the comparative window adjacent to each other or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for viewing a long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately to bring the files together . a simple click starts the merger and uses the fil@@ en@@ ames of the final source file as a pre @-@ set name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re @-@ run it again , then the name of the last used file is maintained . )
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your needs . you can , for example , cut trouble @-@ cutting parts or for correc@@ ting the rep@@ airing .
when reading a file it is handed over to this external command . if the command of the command is specified first ( see above ) , the output of the instruction will be used only when drawing the command line . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have an associated issue line .
the thought behind this is to make the user more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users would like to program it self @-@ programming . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this procedure for new@@ line to convert the input into large letters : sed it / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; \ &apos; \ &apos; s \ &apos; The \ \ &apos; The \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ \ &apos; The \ \ \ &apos; s text .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generated drawing chains ( info : / CV@@ S / Key@@ word Sub@@ stitution ) . you can modify the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s \ \ \ \ &apos; s &apos; \ \ \ \ &apos; s &apos; \ \ \ \ &apos; s &apos; \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ &apos; \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you are experimenting with sed , you may begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further demonstration command of line . sed it / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each matches will be replaced by nothing , thus quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several settings at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; However , are per@@ l some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the above &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for display and for the display . further operations only change the data , which sees the line @-@ away al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ pre@@ processor sees the output of normal pre@@ processor as input .
the predic@@ tor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you can acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy major data in the worst case .
often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder re@@ cur@@ ly compared and guide .
... making a suggestion for every object to put together ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... can sim@@ ulate this and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without putting it really ,
... offers selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparisons between individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are assembled , folder 1 will be used as base . if no target folder was specified , it used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not bring it together . to launch this , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . )
while reading the folder you will find a small message window on current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed until then .
if the scanning of the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left @-@ hand side ...
each file and every folder that was found during scan , is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can double the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow buttons for the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and add all sub@@ directories to which you can catch all folders and folders .
when you click on a file , the file will be started and it will appear in a comparative window .
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case the meeting action will not be automatically re @-@ elected . if that will work together , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black .
with identical inser@@ ts , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if your overall content is identical . then also folder the same color . at folders , the age is irrelevant for his color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ let , which is only green , then yellow becomes and later , when it is old , red becomes .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such error @-@ er@@ ous objects exist , this cannot be started .
... A and B did not have the same file type ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : errors : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such error @-@ er@@ ous objects exist , this cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders were specified and if the config option is synchron@@ ized , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both files are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but are not identical : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after the result copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are assembled and the option new file will be selected instead ( uns@@ afe ) then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to the copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Whi@@ le such mistakes can not be eliminated , the folder can not be started .
while this one co@@ operates a file according to the other . it &apos;s status column reveals Fer@@ tig , if this has been successfully completed , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something unexpected , if something is finished , you should check out a last review and check if the status is all right .
when in the installation dialog the file @-@ method of complete analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflict will only be displayed when three folders are compared or assembled . )
you can either create the just selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have chosen all the contrac@@ ep@@ tive actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start this together .
please note : if you have not specified any target folder , then in three @-@ folder mode C is used as the goal to merge in two @-@ folder @-@ assembled B as target and used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B used as purpose .
if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . there are several options by which specific entries could be ski@@ pped . check these options for un@@ loving surprises :
to link all entries : select a directory @-@ up and continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if contradic@@ tory data types still exist without conflic@@ ting actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid promotion for them .
when you bring all entries together , a dialogue window will appear with the options , sim@@ ulate and abor@@ ting .
select Sim@@ u@@ til when you first want to see what would happen without the really modifications made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; will then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together with a single file ) , then one will pop up together ( note the scre@@ enshot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select a new directory and continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , appears a corresponding dialogue . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you &apos;ll see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with it .
if some entries were individually assembled , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and leads them later in the later list . even if this file has been revised or not saved , these entries are changed once more . only if you change the composite action , these entries are again assembled .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ up with these options :
only files that match to the specified pattern are shown on the element tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary @-@ tree ; it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid space @-@ holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary @-@ tree ; it can be more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ators . valid space @-@ holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that are ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / CV@@ S / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a composite attribute . in other file systems marked an advanced point . this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
when links to files : when the option is switched , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default .
if the option is switched off , the links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively fil@@ tered . a link to a folder of a link on yourself would lead to a final loop and cr@@ amped ; ) This option is switched off in the default .
introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics . ( the number of sol@@ ster , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower if it is applied to files that contain no text . ( type an appropriate Anti @-@ pattern ) .
if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it may be faster , only change the change of change and file size . however , this speed machine does not cost you a certain level of safety . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to trust the chan@@ gel@@ ment date . the files are considered identical when they are equal . it can be useful for example if when copying the change of change . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enabled the synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions are connected to the network so that the results are stored by the files in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe as it will be the knowledge provided that the other file has not been modified . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default .
when a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also concerns the normal composite of individual files , not only the composite folder . this option is switched on in default .
usually , the folder together with the mouse will be visible , you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to , you can switch the window list &amp; text window to switch window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can use a single file also directly with the folder menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be assembled once you start the folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : new &quot; &quot; &quot;
KDE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ slave . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to Open , which are located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ ress archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syn@@ tax than local files and folders . a few things should you be aware of :
a path can be relative . or .. contained . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely .
special characters must be mu@@ til@@ ated . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the used protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way of editing cre@@ denti@@ als or change of change . therefore , the per@@ missions or change of change from the original has been ( please note the confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
the main uses is currently used as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op begins first always the built @-@ in differences in the viewer . to launch K@@ lin@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the Differ@@ en@@ sion and then select in K@@ lin@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as being K@@ Part 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since generating the patch file .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part run , it only supports the comparisons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that together or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( well He@@ ist es Comp@@ are ) already exist . besides , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff@@ 3 of the di@@ ff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GPL @-@ programs for a very long time and learned a lot by watching into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who went this way or go this way .
you may have compiled the program from the sources and the configure @-@ script should not be disclosed to the correct pre@@ fix . at the default configuration in / usr / local , but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find further information on this subject .
if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are sometimes treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is considered not identical . if similar lines are next to each other , this bor@@ der@@ is , but this is the case .
the editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost when the result is easy to save as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format , which might save this information .
the effort for this was so far too big . you can restore a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text should be used for another editor .
after removing text is a sudden ; no sr@@ c line@@ age ; and the text does not delete it . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for producing differences . even more sto@@ cking would be confusing and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . thank you very much !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; use , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new .
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without KDE you can find on the homepage .
you can find a list of the latest amendments under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
KDE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where KDE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use , you should not have any problems in compile it . however , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; @-@ mail list thereof .
cut ( o@@ grams @-@ X or re @-@ Dele@@ te ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current Cur@@ sor@@ position or replaces the current mark@@ er .
only differences show : files that are identical in all folders does not appear in the folder structure , and consequently also not in the target folder .
( in the current version version , you have to re @-@ read the folder after changes to these options . )
there are only entries shown that have differences . this also leads to that identical files will not be copied to the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain , they are missing according to the target version . ( behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
watch the buttons on selecting the source with the marking A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ fire in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nails of all virtual work areas . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work floor , to change its size or shift it . this works both inside a working surface and multiple .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work surfaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved inside of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other workplaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked . if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , on desktop and finish . commands effect the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the work space . appears only if applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual working surface . appears only if applied to an application .
if this box is marked , Windows can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , with the middle mouse button on the desktop and can be moved to other work areas .
when this field is crossed , im &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work space is shown .
cru@@ ising this field leaves the &amp; ch@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual work space will display . together with name display , the names will be displayed with folder @-@ numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . working surface .
if this field is crossed , the background of each work surface is also displayed as background in the &amp; ch@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as a small window in the &amp; ch@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to make their selection available .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple justification with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the main window will be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2@@ x@@ n run@@ time , all virtual work areas are known in a horizontal and vertically in a vertical row , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop .
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display the windows as symbols or with its content and it also runs outside the control bar .
click on the right button of the mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and end @-@ to @-@ end selection of switches ... allows the dialogue to appear .
at the moment , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings , but you can do it manually :
access the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ ag@@ gu@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or VII . if you don &apos;t have any typ@@ ing to the file , you need to register as a user root user account or subscribe to your system administrator . in this file you need to enter the key wind@@ ow@@ tic mode and assign a value to it . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly enhanced to expand new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance calcul@@ ators .
when you want to boot , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen is displayed . below , this window will be displayed as a magni@@ fying window . the image , which is shown in the magni@@ fying window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ likes ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a moving window . alternatively , you can &amp; k@@ like ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ cursor at the screen ( eg . on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in enlarged window is displayed , select the settings mouse @-@ cursor . please note that &amp; k@@ likes ; currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse @-@ cursor . this is always the default size ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse cursor .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and mouse keys and change its size . this can take place in the following ways :
move the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button depres@@ sed , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fier window and move it into the arrow .
if you also press the &amp; Shift ; button or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can shift the selection window .
with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . keep in mind that the top left corner of the selection window will remain firm and just move the bottom right corner .
&amp; k@@ likes ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , into a file , into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , turn the picture and much more .
starts or stops the update of the display . the update of the update causes the required CPU time against 0 .
select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ likes ; uses automatically your introduc@@ tory short @-@ list for storing files , opening a new window , prints , new@@ bie ( with the button document again in &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fying and los@@ ers &amp; etc .
k@@ may also be known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use a screen to enlarge as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research che@@ ur or artists to the Web@@ designer or visually handic@@ apped .

&amp; mou@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; em@@ ulate a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse @-@ cursor a while at the same place har@@ es . it is meant to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ ray @-@ in @-@ case syndrome ) and with which every mouse click is pain .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; em@@ ulate a mouse @-@ click , once the mouse cursor a while at the same point . it is meant to help people suffer the repeti@@ tive ray in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse @-@ click pain . furthermore , it can em@@ ulate the mouse with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; can handle the ache , which occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to utilize the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from pain involving your computer , you should seek a doctor if this has not yet been done .
to clarify it once again : even though &amp; k@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; pain helps eliminate the causes associated with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by the use of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic auxili@@ ary means : the result may be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool ; is simple : &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool ; watch your mouse movements and guides a mouse @-@ click if you break down the movement shortly .
if the smart shift is activated , makes &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool ; a pause , after being running the button of mouse @-@ mouse before the det@@ achment of the mouse button is executed . in this way you can execute the finish at pressing mouse button . in this way you can run the pulling in the pressing mouse button . the intelligent verb takes a little practice , but you get used quickly by it .
this devi@@ ation time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; mou@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; one mouse click .
if intelligent it is switched on , the speed field difference is di@@ pped ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool ; after downloading the mouse button , before you start the mouse button again , if there is no claim for the mouse in the meantime .
&amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool ; supports now the click of mouse @-@ Shift . this function now creates a slow move to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; the first time started , but they can be modified later .
when the sound appears , you can &amp; k@@ de ; to do so , move the reaction time to shor@@ ten . open the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to sound &amp; multimedia , select sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you to a lower value to shor@@ ten the responses .
if this setting is marked , &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool is started ; at every launch of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently available only at &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program there .
sets all settings back on the values which were set at the opening of the dialogue . have you already pushed the button applic@@ ators , the settings will be reset to the last press of users .
best to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular the smart reloc@@ ating you should be turned off first . if you then click to the automatic click , you can later drag the smart shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the responses of &amp; k@@ de ; to decrease sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not constitute a link , does not lead to un@@ earth@@ ed reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you would like to use them again .
when your mouse prints , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball .
first , you need to take out the mouse @-@ ball . as that happens , from mouse to mouse , it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the so@@ iling can be easily swal@@ low with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ ter ; if you have just begun to push the smart shift , this means that &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ ter ; the operation can no longer end using the slogan of the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is reset the status of &amp; mou@@ th@@ set@@ tool ; it is reset , and you can work as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; mou@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool to execute and sets the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor , where you want to have it . however , you can &apos;t see the mouse on a neutral area of work space when you are a key@@ note mouse . so you can &apos;t see a distor@@ tion of mouse button . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; win ; the gray areas around tool@@ bars and menus and the front lines of windows .
I try to move with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t manage to edit it text .
the intelligent reloc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; mou@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and re @-@ insert it or move any other action in which you want to move the mouse into pressing mouse button . however , there will be some advice to them :
do not use the intelligent reloc@@ ate if you just start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; to use this text rather : execute a mouse @-@ click at the end of the text box , while you move the mouse button down to the other end of the text and once again pressing the mouse button .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this button , every@@ time you play a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when intelligent res@@ ize the difference period begins . later , you can use the smart shift without using the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ ld@@ tool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; it should be the case on most systems already .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loud@@ speakers and that is a correct set up .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor briefly lap@@ sed . this program was developed for people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and to which the bed@@ side of the mouse &apos;s pain is prepared .
&amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ tool , can also be configured so that it will be a certain time that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is released before the mouse button is released . in this way the pulling and desc@@ ends with the mouse can be performed .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the stupid user can let her computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , you can let the user speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk process , which should be discussed once again .
on the first page of the assistant ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command that is used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialo@@ gs .
on the second page you can choose the default text@@ book . from the text pass@@ book books you can often choose text passages without typ@@ ing it . the text@@ passages may naturally be edited .
on the third page ( right @-@ screen shot ) you will determine the dictionary for the word supplement . &amp; k@@ mouth . read the KDE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of the individual words . additionally , you can specify the wording of a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly letters are taken into the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; mouth ; is clear and essentially contains a input field for the keyboard message of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a comparison memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
if you have a mouth right , you can enter the propositions at the input field that you want to hear . each spoken set is attached to the cache . you can select from it propositions which should be discussed once again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog includes two card cards , voice output and settings , the page Wor@@ iter@@ ation as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the card voice output , you give the command to the call of language generators . in the selection field below the input field , specify the string code that will be shared with the text on the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two kinds , to pass the text . select the cross @-@ box if the text is to be transmitted as standard input to the language generator .
if the Connec@@ ting field is not selected , the text is passed as parameters . you can use the following wild@@ card :
of course , the command to the voice output is dependent on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation of your language generator . examples for this please see App@@ endi@@ x .
use as a language service as a language service , &amp; mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings will be available on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a stand@@ ardis@@ ed interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down promotion , after selecting a text key@@ note , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text line in the text pass@@ age@@ book or in the list for text pass@@ age@@ text@@ books .
with the selection of so@@ jour@@ n the chosen text line is spoken directly and inserted in addition to the storage box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text was first entered only into the input field .
with the second selection field C@@ lose the editing player for text pass@@ book you can specify , whether the text pass@@ book book will be automatically saved with the editing of the editing pane .
the book can be saved with the selection of text pass@@ book book . if you choose any changes , the text @-@ pass@@ book book will not be saved . select before saving , will &amp; mouth ; ask if the text @-@ pass@@ book is to be saved .
the site of Wor@@ iter@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the wording . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field where this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the dictionary to choose Wor@@ iter@@ ation .
with the buttons on the right side , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and select language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; mouth ; reads the &amp; quot ; -@@ documentation . the frequency of the individual words is determined simply by lowering the occurrence . additionally , you can compare the word@@ list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; mouth : then , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are assembled , and how this wei@@ ghted will be .
with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; mouth . new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary .
the main section of the window to edit text pass@@ age@@ books is tw@@ o@@ fold . in the upper part , the text pass@@ age@@ books are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text line , you can change the text @-@ text or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book book , you can only change its name .
actions like new text@@ books or books add or delete selected text passages and books you can either get via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar , or on a folding menu .
the order of text @-@ pass@@ books or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new place or with the arrows and the &quot; Alt ; &quot; key .
the selected text is cut off and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it will otherwise use the selected ranges of the storage box .
the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if the text box is selected , it is used , otherwise the selected sections of the storage box .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected propositions of the transfer store .
when this menu @-@ entry is crossed , a default tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default via the editing window directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the left side of the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
if this menu @-@ entry is crossed , a narrow ridge in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden .
when this menu @-@ entry is crossed , a post@@ pon@@ able lease for text pass@@ age@@ text@@ books is displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the left side , the tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for the VO issue properly or not completely entered . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the voice output on the card language version . ( see installation dialog for Language @-@ Ad@@ izer to further details . )
Festival is a language issue of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license allows you to use Festival for free and re@@ distribute it without limitations .
to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival area . the command to the language version is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a secure language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license permits it to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and further without limitations .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output is accepted that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the speech is then possible with one of the three following instruction programs :
for the third example , the option must be switched on as standard input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ es in a Wav@@ ed@@ i um , therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ integrate the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples :
( Cat - echo quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ spl@@ ay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to send data as standard input .
the VO dem@@ on von &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; D ; -@@ Continu@@ ing language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is currently being developed in SV@@ N . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice output systems .
since the adjustment of language generators is only carried out at the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as language service as possible in &amp; mouth .
to adjust the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the installation dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; mouth ; successful use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for language generator ) , but that depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak text by the computer . it is saved a list of already saved sentences , which the users can always release anew .
keep in mind that &amp; mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer includes . on the computer you have to be installed a langu@@ izer .

before you can use &amp; t@@ ts , you must install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also
at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as there is no speaker set up , the card @-@ card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have installed at least one speaker , the card is General . see .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that are described in volume or speed . they can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . a so furnished combination of language , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume and speed is called a speaker . you should at least use a speaker before you &amp; t@@ ts ; use , since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher uses otherwise the default speaker .
different present@@ ers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable with multiple printers to the same printer .
if you click on the card @-@ card speaker in t@@ ect@@ or@@ gr , the card @-@ card speaker is shown automatically when you start ect@@ t@@ gr and then no speaker is set up .
all already furnished speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear above in the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application has no present@@ er .
to click with a mouse click on a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
just select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to move the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines its priority .
click on one of these buttons , to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
select a vocal type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - and maid &apos;s voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new spokes@@ person will appear on the card reader . to change the settings of this intercom , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the cardboard card General and check if voice output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; k@@ de ; do . see now you can use &amp; t@@ ts ; click on the card orders to create and manage text entries .
if you have installed at least one speaker , you can start the program system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the card @-@ card General to open this card card . here you can set some general options .
select this setup field to activate the &amp; t@@ ts ; this starts the KDE T@@ TS @-@ Service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can create text orders and read it . see . remove the mark@@ er , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS @-@ System by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is stopped , runs &amp; t@@ ts ; further , provided that the field voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .

filter for drawing chain replacement offer a good possibility in &amp; t@@ ts ; it is a good example . you remove the tags br and b from the news , the k@@ mail sent , and also the expression / local / In@@ box because it can be accepted in most cases as assumed .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; . for normal working with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is dealt with before being sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation in order to select correctly stated words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to byp@@ ass certain shortcomings of voice fi@@ bers and their voices .
to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; t@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts .
the output of screen reel has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the orders are continued again .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg is welcome to read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; mouth ; someone welcome the room . &amp; cold messages are also messages . read about this .
the rest are simple text entries . each order to initiate orders from the card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text contracts are intended for issue longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queue , except the output of screen reel . if an application is sending the output of a screen reel , while &amp; t@@ ts ; just another pre@@ read , this issue will be stopped and ended .
first you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reel . you will be applied to regular warnings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; des .
filter supplies the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are run as modules . in the future , there can be further kinds of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . you can specify either words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; into a better intelli@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files to translate &quot; &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
with Interphone op@@ ters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or , depending on the program , which has the text on &amp; t@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . if you have set for example on the card present@@ er to read a female voice , you can read text from KDE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e read about it .
each of these different filter has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules does not apply , he continues to keep the text unchanged at the next filter .
if a text job , a message , warning or a &amp; kis@@ sing ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it by all the activated filters supplied on the page down . processing through the filter is carried out in sequence from top to bottom .
this displays the list of standard normal filters . if a filter is not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filters are lab@@ eled the row down from the top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter and it will display the following setup dialo@@ gs .
for setting up strings you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . these patterns are exchanged in the text , then the text is replaced with the associated replacement code . large and lower case is not observed when compared .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name for any number ; he only has to distinguish himself from the name of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string lines made in the column . the list is processed in the sequence from above down@@ wards .
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save the current list or delete . download a list from a file , the entries are attached from the file to the existing list .
here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to select a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click on the &quot; C@@ tr@@ l &quot; button .
here is a value registered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application @-@ based programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must leave you we@@ d@@ - if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the App@@ lic@@ ting ID @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you can only have to copy applications .
the strings filter will only be applied to the text , when all conditions apply with an entry in the box De@@ c Filter if align . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all the texts .
in comparison of words , the drawing filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( blank spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular , press &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular , &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; phrases &amp; # 160 ; phrases are available in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .

K@@ T@@ TS also works with each voice synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in a single console ;
the list of the above languages may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , use the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information , which are not yet included in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module @-@ architecture for voice . if you would like to expand &amp; t@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but is not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of KDE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages , and developer files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you refer to the source text of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source text archive for k@@ tures , or have downloaded the current tar@@ ball every night , then install and install the program using the following commands :
before you use &amp; t@@ ts ; use , check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ ar SPD @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; des ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program called speech disp@@ at@@ cher is used , so that the installation of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script should no longer be needed .
a long text is dis@@ sem@@ bled into individual sentences . the user can refrain from the pro@@ posi@@ tional or promis@@ ist , repeat the output or dis@@ ruption .
if an application gives text to &amp; t@@ ts ; over , it can request the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . thus , one application can request for example a female English speaker . if you choose a speaker whose language English and the gender is female , this one will otherwise choose the best matching speaker . if you choose to learn more about it , such as &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker chooses to see in .
if you click on the card present@@ er to add to add a speaker to the list or click on it , the card @-@ card spokes@@ person will display . as an example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . for example , the installation of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules can be found under .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter in the festival area .
select the string code for text , which is transferred to the festival . in case of voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting will be automatically made . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you put volume , speech speed and audio @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ator and display these grey , the voice chosen by you won &apos;t be able to adjust these settings .
some voices such as multi@@ sy@@ n voices need to be loaded for several seconds due to their size , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with large storage capacity ) the first movement will be synthes@@ ized faster .
if this cross @-@ field cannot be selected , you still have no speaker set up ( or forget about any application to click ) .
if this crosses is marked , becomes visible at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol t@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this crosses is marked and t@@ ect@@ s@@ gr is not yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or otherwise control the program .
here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of order , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card @-@ card speaker .
with the buttons in this series you can order sat@@ an order in the order that is selected in the list below , pre @-@ going or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken to the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ en , click on the card reader audio . see also .
here are only text files listed and managed . expenses of screen reel , warnings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; t@@ ts ; either with no support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or &amp; kt@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
when G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select the audio output . if no cur@@ l module is displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module . have Al@@ sa selected , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the consultation speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed .
click App@@ den to adopt the new settings for the running &amp; desktop system .
the list of al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are decorated in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select standard .
on this card card , you can set special action that will always be executed if the text message is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; t@@ ts ; processes four types of language entries :
the output of screen reel has the highest priority . it is drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen readers have been pre @-@ read , the orders were res@@ umed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor gets too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and regular text . these orders are continuing after reading the warning again .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can welcome to &amp; mouth ; anyway someone welcome the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen controller , adds &amp; t@@ ts ; the audio output ends in the queue .
this audio file will always be played if a normal text job is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are valid only for normal text entries . for messages , warnings and spending of Screen Sa@@ a@@ vers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ not@@ fy news to leave , start t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click aler@@ ts . the card aler@@ ts will appear .
highlight this setup field to switch the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; adap@@ tations . this setting is not marked , the rest of the settings are disabled and t@@ ect@@ ts ; reads no aler@@ ts before .
if this setting is marked , noti@@ fications when a sound is played , by &amp; t@@ ts ; not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned in an IR@@ C message your nickname .
all events , for which in the list nothing else is stated , are ignored by &amp; t@@ ts ; ignored .
use this selection field to specify what &apos;s going to do when an event arrives . you have the following options :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ card :
you can enter here the properties of the desired intercom . standard el@@ ects the speaker that is shown on the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if for a certain event of a particular application a action is specified , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all the other events of the particular application . as the last possibility comes the action to carry , which was determined by default ( all other events ) .
the event All aler@@ ts for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the warning messages as follows :
use the button Save to save the settings for the aler@@ ts to a file . use the button store to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Dele@@ te . all entries are deleted except all directions .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a speech output . this standard contains brands for controlling the voice , voice of voice and sound level . also , brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation by example . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ id XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) as this is the default voice that the festival is used in the SS@@ ML edition .
if the settings for speed or tape in the festival configuration is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % SS@@ ML text usually is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filter ) . SB@@ Ds are sub@@ mitting text in individual sentences . thus , only the first proposition must be synthes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop or stop back on the card orders , even if the language is not directly supported .
here you see the set @-@ border filter filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as pres@@ et@@ ting @-@ border filter . you can modify its settings or add further stat@@ uses filters , beginners will be deduc@@ ted from it .
on the easiest way you will learn the selection of speech selection by trying out . turn off the card selection , change a number of features and check how the selection of the speech is altered . of course , you have to have done more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ eff@@ ec@@ tual .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; to start faster with the start , since only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can keep text entries on the cart@@ on card or break off , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons the normal det@@ ects filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just remove anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and insert a tab sign ( dec@@ imal codes 8 ) at the proposition limits ( tab is removed from the text ) . note that the standard @-@ stretching filter is enclosed in character .
SB@@ D filter will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News ( k@@ p ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed from comparisons to the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter , you can insert it again by charging the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c .
at the cart@@ on menu , you can write the spokes@@ person for the application . the card card is displayed when
the use of the default speakers ( the top@@ most on the card speaker ) . in other words , no speaker .
use of the most suitable speaker , which displays all the properties of a fully equipped intercom . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the intercom function , if you choose the settings of the intercom . otherwise , &amp; kt@@ ts ; this or@@ ator does not choose , the or@@ derly , the originally issued properties .
select the method to enter the desired spre@@ aders by clicking on one of the sel@@ ections .
choose the characteristics of the desired speech . if this property doesn &apos;t play a role , you enter nothing .
highlight this setup field if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue , it will always use this property . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language , is before you know that a specific application is sent text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all properties in the field of speaker , which corresponds most to the following is to delete , click on the selection button , and then use the speaker that corresponds most to the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text job in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number is the input 0 ) .
t@@ ect@@ t@@ sm@@ gr dropped immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get any feedback .
G@@ stre@@ amer has crashed and kt@@ ts ; it was probably finished . at G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ stre@@ amer .
the audio output about al@@ sa doesn &apos;t work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text job , fri@@ ert &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : to @-@ open PC@@ M .
on your system there is the problem that conflict with al@@ sa occur that prevent an equ@@ itable opening of several PC@@ M devices . information for possible solutions can be found on the website of the al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and can use it in the festival , but t@@ opped gr is not showing this voice .
add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festival@@ int . as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you found the voice to the developer .
on the cart@@ ei@@ vers audio there is a setting speed . in order this does work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be det@@ ectable by the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthes@@ iz@@ er@@ module such as Festival Interactive offer a adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice is this active or in@@ active .
the settings for the intercom speed are ignored if &amp; t@@ ts ; ( see it that the HTML will be converted into SS@@ ML . SS@@ ML has its own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are fully courageous , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ fil@@ tering , and set the intercom speed .
I don &apos;t manage that web pages be pre @-@ read with a female voice . I created a female Festival @-@ speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at the festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able Gender does not appear to function . so that festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file poses to the converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber however the gender @-@ tags . the same also applies to the Voice @-@ tags .
I have added a separate strings filter and now I can move in &amp; kt@@ ts ; not more sat@@ anic orders - or going back . on the card &apos;s orders is displayed , the order &apos;s orders only from one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , question signs , compos@@ ites , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter them . instead , use a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection instead .

before you &amp; t@@ ts ; use , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ izer whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you must install at least one language . help find out in the instructions that are delivered with festival . do not want to read websites , you must install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you must compile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer .
this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / or / Russian / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding just like KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions you are looking for first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , option code must be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option has to set code on an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ on such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ fication analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it creates the audio output . this &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice system system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ dac@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
with this method , additional Wr@@ apper code will be added to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes for voice synthesis will not be used in the MB@@ RO@@ LA , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the R &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows the management of the network interfaces , the routine and the DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings for a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu @-@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf : package has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the contro@@ l@@ work@@ station ; to create a simple surface for the following tasks :
after the installation a new module network settings at &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; displayed . network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers have to have been installed and configured , so that &amp; net@@ work@@ station ; the device altogether provides and the setting of network properties allows .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed at installing &amp; Linux ; with installed and furnished . network devices later added , the drivers will need to be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version :
the network settings will be loaded when the option network settings at the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected will be chosen . at the startup of the module network settings , this system is automatically credited to the system .
if the platform can not be recognized , the local selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release is best meets . by flag@@ ging the setting Not @-@ again , the setting can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be automatically set accordingly .
the change of network settings is possible only in the system administration mode . previously , all options are grey , meaning the settings can be considered not possible . in the system administration mode , you get to the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three horse@@ men :
the tab interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system . all available networks are displayed . from the rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed :
the default settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further possibilities .
in automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are taken from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , TCP / IP @-@ settings are necessary for the system simultaneously with the launch of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will be necessary for any further setting . in the selection list can be selected either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP according to the system .
the choice of manual can be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask is defined .
if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alisation is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values in this dialogue are shown as properties of the device in the device .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network will not already be used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . by ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you may find whether the requested address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . switch of a switched network device is checked by selecting the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your requirements . switch off of a activated network device is enabled by selecting the list and clicking on the interface .
sets the IP address of the host in local sub@@ net that conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ net networks .
if there is more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support is replaced by the appropriate IP address . that is necessary because computers may only understand IP addresses . if the computer calls htt@@ p : / / www.@@ en@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNA dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the computer &apos;s attri@@ bution @-@ resolution describes a simple copy of this list . entries can be added , removed , or altered . DNS files can be re @-@ ordered by selecting a tra@@ int and adding or her@@ men@@ dation in the list with the buttons or inser@@ ting in the priority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Add &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a DNS server can be added . it will be the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry is then inserted in the list .
from the group computer to nam@@ ing solution , select an entry and then click the button Be@@ work .... It will be the dialog editing .
the list notably known machines describes calcul@@ ator @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when boats are used when no DNS server can be available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS server .
usually , the list includes known machines to support some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ ost@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test @-@ being version of IP should replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the familiar computer and click Add to add .... The dialogue between the new Ali@@ as will be displayed .
to add the name of the known host , and clicking the button Add . if the known computer has several ali@@ ases , add the button to add multiple times and enter the other Ali@@ as name .
select an entry of a well known file from the list and choose to work .... The dialog of the machine is shown .
it may be one of the following tasks to be executed , then click OK will update the list of static Ho@@ sts .
the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be placed in a single console ; the following command must be dropped .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
for installation of binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t have been installed .
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things is required .
this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult , &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; to compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology will be given , in the second all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files .
this area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this attachment , only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is taught .
IP @-@ netz@@ works with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large distribution . from IP@@ v@@ 6 it is expected that in the near future , this description focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to assign which IP @-@ address of a network interface is assigned . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the contact point , which is a valid IP address , or if available , the IP address can not be chosen easily !
when setting an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for such purpose reserved to avoid IP @-@ address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses of the table below are not forwar@@ ded on the Internet , therefore its use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a gate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the area of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 is used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the standard route is required for the IP Re@@ wards .
the C@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.0.@@ 1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ station ; and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file sometimes happens dynam@@ ically by DSL connections , so that it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections , any other content can be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand as awaits therefore can occur .

&amp; k@@ dat : is a backup program for band @-@ runs on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to establish a surface for tar , which offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to a fast , selective clearing . the second goal was to answer a question which my wife asked : how much longer takes it when you secur@@ es ?
before a tape can be used , it must be consul@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . that can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; split the band back and read the pre @-@ voltage information of the bands . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat : the pro@@ vision@@ ing on the tape are not asked , you are asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
det@@ ects &amp; k@@ lag ; the pro@@ vision@@ ing , looking for the appropriate index on your record . can not be found , you are asked if the band index is to be created new .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the belt work is changing , to indicate that the band is involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched through out of the entry for the band .
in front of the failure of the bank , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; Le@@ dat : gives you a change in the symbol for the belt , that integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be dis@@ car@@ ded without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
one band &apos;s types have to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not comply with format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not have to happen before you are format@@ ted by using the belt . flo@@ ppy band drives usually do not use a format@@ ting of the belt , DAT drives , however , not .
after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the belt . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the procedure , the belt is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the files you need . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or a folder in the local file tree ; it is only backed up to that file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . it will only be backed up in the profile files .
highlight files in local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ ght ...
once the backup was introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you will once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to secure ; the dialogue shows the progress of the process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or a folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder is checked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
highlight the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
once the test run has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for checking .
if you have confirmed the settings for veri@@ fying , the dialog appears over . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time .
before you can restore the Rest@@ ore , the files you should be restored , be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that will be entry for the belt work . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Rest@@ ore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialogue will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for restoration .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialogue will be re@@ inst@@ ated . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be a necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file with the band &apos;s content . this process is del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types from the band :
in this way , a backup profile with the currently marked files and the default settings will be created . you can make a backup profile the following settings :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of securities files will be automatically updated in accordance with the currently selected work folder .
for all files listed under he@@ dging files , applies that only the files are stored in the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ esystem , you can apply separately in backup files . each entry is seen by tar regardless of the other .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last intact backup is used .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons ; puts ; and lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can set you above the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the belt works ( usually / dev / Tap@@ e ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ vit@@ ch version of the belt device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved , the command will be loaded to drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
is the option switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the throw from the band@@ age . possibly this setting does not work with all band members .
if the option is switched on , while solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the band dis@@ car@@ ded . use this option not with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
is the option switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ war@@ es@@ ei@@ ous block size for the band@@ age change . not all drives support variable block sizes . whether this attitude is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band &apos;s work will communicate .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band format@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the bank . this file should only be shown a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n by@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this string is calcul@@ ator : seconds , where calcul@@ ator was the full name of the system on which the volume was format@@ ted . seconds , the number of seconds , which have passed since the epoch , in which the volume was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar @-@ archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar ad@@ minister . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not about incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup database . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users access the quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background . the task of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system depos@@ ited the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users access the quick access for example to information about problems which occur on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; thus , tries to provide some advanced features , using which the protocol files of certain programs are fil@@ tered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful features . among other things include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ s@@ log server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol @-@ file is easy to filter and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and fil@@ tering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after starting the launch &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first , the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocols - to open the system protocols ; very likely not start with system administration right . the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually does not have permission for reading .
you can also use the filter side@@ bar to filter a select string in the fil@@ tering block . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only log @-@ line will be shown to the selected filter . then , a protocol @-@ line contains only if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search device .
you can also select another entry at this point . select the string search box then only with the entries in the column select column . select for example in the fil@@ tering file system protocol , showing you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are shown with a show@@ y color as protocol lines the level notice . the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on furniture dialog .
if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use fil@@ tering .
in addition , you can jump the option to view new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new lines @-@ lines .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage . once you selected a window , select a protocol for viewing .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find further information about the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; you will also find in the following folder of the &amp; Fol@@ de ; Subversion Archi@@ vs : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; Archive ; - Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ k ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it develops quickly for the control of the program starts at the high @-@ end of the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it bin@@ der is under / s@@ bin and not below / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine to system V in@@ it without making a re@@ install and re @-@ format@@ ting . therefore , you need to ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for every system service , which you want to start at the high @-@ end of the system or when changing to another round level . system services involve not such things as set @-@ up , which is only once started . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also specify a r@@ c.@@ c in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out something what has to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the standard lap@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should start a line as the following in the initial range :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pre @-@ indicated run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you do something out , then get it repaired by starting the system and execute the following :
but how did you start all the correct scripts ? if you &apos;re typ@@ ing -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is links to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how starts and stopping in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : any of the scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually launch this scripts from hand on the command line :
this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one K involves , the script is called with the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start .
some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I could &amp; win ; a server running , which leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; and beyond , I could also have a user @-@ running , the &amp; eg ; &amp; d@@ ote ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . it should not be very difficult as the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not be tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of avail@@ abilities system services to one of the six round level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by taking it somewhere else . this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of Av@@ ail@@ able system services .
note : entries are moved , if you copy them into a new area . to select them only on a new run@@ time , you must select specifically copying from the menu or insert from the context menu , even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try to include the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries into the rec@@ ycle bin so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work@@ spaces ( Av@@ ail@@ able system services , running 1 stop , run@@ time 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to another running level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired round level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an order manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . join the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings will be stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise , it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . changes to the pres@@ ets are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I &apos;ve experim@@ ented with the standard lap@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts up @-@ to @-@ date . what can I do ?
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to launch in an individual user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the standard lap@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to execute under Run@@ ning X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual from distribution .
the way , such as system services are rest@@ art@@ ed in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you use any other distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( like &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) are just without notice if their configuration files are not present or false .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the running level , so that this manual can be attached .
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
once you have made changes , you must save it . either use the appropriate tool@@ bar icon or the entry to be saved in the File menu .
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and user list . for use , select the desired user or the required group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user @-@ or group properties .
some card cards are only shown if you have extended extended system settings . only if you have limited restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a cardboard card will be created , if you are able to make individual settings , if wrong cards or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
the card administration pass@@ codes appears , if shadow @-@ passwords , or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes .
this card card appears only if for at least a single @-@ connected file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can change parameters for each user , whereby space restrictions are available in KB :
these parameters can be set on individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected , with the help of the field file system .
the card supports groups informed about the group &apos;s participation of the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the field of primary group . furthermore , the user can become member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog &apos;s characteristics of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add out of the menu user or group or click the appropriate tool@@ bar button . the edit or dele@@ tion of the selected user and the selected group is an@@ alog@@ ous .
with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the boot@@ password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the default operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , modify , change and more .
