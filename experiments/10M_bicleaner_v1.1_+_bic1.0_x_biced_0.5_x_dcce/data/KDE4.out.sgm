<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of portrayed folder-hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map graphically. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must possess the sum of sizes of subordinate objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At a FSView; it reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is specified as the sum of the size of the entries. accordingly, large files can be easily detected at the folder hierarchy. accordingly, it can be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; commands you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the map-map representation of a rectangle that represents a file or a folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the justification have a meaningful color for color monitoring and marking settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The colour of a rectangle, which is switched on view color mode, can be either depth to the slight detection of the heaters or representation of a different file, such as name, owner, group or mime-type.</seg>

<seg id="19">In display algorithms for treads, the rule should be respected that the surface is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this purpose will not always be observed. if you need space, then the subordinate entries are no longer available. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">As for the distribution of an entry for the subordinate entries, the implementation remains left. here it is for the protesting and to avoid space losses by means of always beneficial the areas that are as square. the best methods on this are lines, columns, or recursive captions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimal booked area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a robbery-pattern is drawn into the area of the subordinate entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry.</seg>

<seg id="62">You can also visit the publication; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about & management came here.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved, is the registration in the developer mailing list. guide to the sign in the developer mailing list from & management came;.</seg>
<seg id="64">Once you start off, you'll be asked where you want to save your images and your database. here, you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. just enter or click the folder icon Folder symbol to select a folder.</seg>

<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are registered by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera can also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">& As came, the program gphoto2 is used to communicate with digital cameras. gphoto2 is a free, further separable protocol created by over 800 cameras. gphoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine. since photos in general large files are outdated and transmission through serial port, this connection is meanwhile outdated. & management came, supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexable support so that the EXIF support is required by some libgphoto2 camera drivers to read the thumbnails. if the EXIF support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to take pictures or the production could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & desk has arrived, how easy to expand its functionality by modules:</seg>

<seg id="148">Metadata are defined as data relating to data. metadata are provided in accordance with your definition, the information on or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to claim if you have more than 1,000 photos on your computer, then you don't even need to find out how many photos you have, then you definitely use it and deleted.. the approach to store the metadata both in a database and in the image files, you can access very fast seeking and secure archiving on which you can freely access by other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you do and need to know before doing anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you need to decide whether other access to your photos may be stored, whether you want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. please note that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you'll be happy with this structure. holiday pictures can be found quickly about your location. the remaining photos are organized in one year several times the same place. the remaining photos will be organized using your date. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolder like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; use is a folder for images that you print or publish on a web page.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, working courses, constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all. within 10 years, 95% of the archives and 5% of work files will not be created and you will not want to reorganise your structure for these contents.</seg>
<seg id="153">Which types of files fit together? the separation of file types makes stacker processing simpler. separate new of old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The split of original and working files simplify a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option Metadata to store in the site of the metadata and checking it. this makes sure that Exif- and IPTC data can be written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding point menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which change? to do this, & order came; give them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now, the real work begins, as you now need to assign any picture keywords, marking and rating. of course, you can select all the pictures, who need the same attribute and then set the value. it makes sense, as you can concentrate on the best photos.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now leave us with keywords, keywords, as you are frequently called hot, or categories on other programs. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then it's going to insert the tree for you. the converting the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can simply be done by applying a subtree to another. the modified keywords are monitored by & digitised; updated while there are the sub-trees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata changes. this is a very large representation, since each block of metadata in truth is composed of many sections. filenames and calendar dates of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough the keywords - the next section refers to signposts or comments, the third important tool to cataloguze your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to not only see your photos with your friends, they want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you consider it nearer, then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this of the Landeplatz of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! one starts to dream, associations, the historical time period is again present, you might even listen to the silence. so the caption has completely changed your perception of this panoramas.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others watching your photos, the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. remember, the key is the meaning to the viewer to help Him talk about the motif you move has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine when a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With a digitised, you can use any number of text, in an internationalised alphabet (UTF-8), then those marking can also be exported to your wishes into the labeling and / or the title of the Web Galeriesystems. you have to tell the story for the opening hours a second time.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without navigation system? she was not a boring planet before Google Earth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already starts with light speed.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of geolouring are already innumerable and will be more increasing in the future. I'm sure that one day, in the near future, you can start your travels virtual. this then shows the photos at the reception. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the googlemaps.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and identifies the practice to remove copyright restrictions to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all the changed versions, i.e. also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the furniture page from & radio came; as information you should be deposited:</seg>
<seg id="172">The author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who has created the photo, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used again. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author name): associated with the author. examples might be the work designation of the photographer. examples for this may be the photographer, freelance photographer or Independent photographer. since this is a note to the author's field, this has to be filled out.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider to identify who the photo offers. this does not necessarily need to be the author. if the photographer does for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here. if the picture is a warehouse photo, then here the group / agency that offers the image here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright section, although this has no protection against abuse. each of which has no protection against abuse. each of which has a little bit more than basic metadata, clear or change. the solution to this problem are digital watermarks. for private individuals this is very important for most of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important to them.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & management came, will present such a module for stacking processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Themes: plate errors, plate power, power breaches, ECC, transmission mistake, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, spastering, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the road or fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen on traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are talking about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data exchange company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes loss of data.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, these are more cautious and you can no longer be trusted as a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in filing quality, which are more difficult to obtain and much more expensive. there are offers of gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years for itself. whether you believe it is in your measurable room.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good discs and good reception devices and use them in the right way. the best DVD receptions are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much reliable. so it turns to select the right.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to error, even if you have just been written. therefore, they use a control mechanism to protect oneself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we needed for the formatting and control procedures. despite this massive protection they are required by chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called isoBuster which apparently causes miracle in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is also not available for Macs. there are also similar applications which damaged data from damaged floppies, harddisks, flashmedia, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to store the Formatorium against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and therefore almost sixty-layer the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that is said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu-ray disk.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good reception device on high quality media in a non-quality media. read then the media with a description, date & author markers and afterwards on a clean, dark dry and before animals protected place. do not forget the data on the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk-manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturing cranes include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a great field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: discrete study</seg>
<seg id="187">Soon: Disks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperate range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C. at lower temperatures, this error increases. some of SMART fixed errors are reported immediately after expiration. these are particularly readsheets and deprivation count. the expected life-time period is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is a question of the loss of loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a blackout before you backed the files, but these losses normally leave without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electrical devices do not account a lot, the device looks different with devices with computer chips and high-speed processays. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause severe damage, hardware replacement, destroyed motherboards, and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against blackheads is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbed a part of the energy-heat and the rest finds. it is usually available in the form of a steckerboard. however, remember that not every trieckerboard also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, then you should pay attention to the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also pay attention to protecting the protection against flash supplement and thus protects the proper devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">As an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should be aware that also all peripherals that can be connected to your system. some manufacturers make overvoltage protective sliders which also contain a telephone line for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of cable modems and television programs.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have an emergency, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks which are very small and you also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection your system protects from smaller variations into the power lines, it will not really help you in a full cut out. even an emergency of few seconds can lead to loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be sensible to invest in a non-stop power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">Apart from the protection against overvoltage, these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a power cut comes. this gives you the possibility to store your data and then run the system. if you buy a USV then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the time of battery and the attached software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Check out the potential risk that your billing system is exposed and compare its security in electricity defects with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can be saved for less than & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind how well your machine is protected with it. at the end, you should remember all the cables to be separated before you go into the holidays.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service. with the right configuration, you can use this as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to store this as a backup goal for your software. Google Shared Storage is a further popular offer with which you can store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">In comparison to the hard drives, they are very expensive - 40 GB costs & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollar; 500. in addition, you must send the data via the comparatively slow Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are suited only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important ones. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution. it is too slow.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the Photo-Community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not find your images in full resolution online. the professional version provides you with unlimited memory, which should be checked in reality only.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the Web-solutions are very secure. transmission errors are automatically scaled thanks to the TCP protocol and with the big companies included a backup and distribution memory. thus, they are desasterased.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of transmission chain in the PC. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem and btrfs represent at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transfer error occurred, not when this happens in your computer. all these disorders remain undetected until you have no protection for it. no one seems to have thought to have. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power parts are another source of transmission loss because they generate interference within the data streams. at normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already 2010, you will see thousands of mistakes per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle turnout at low levels and can be scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under one of the GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it is available soon also for & Linux; and Windows is available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in the Alpha status. it uses the same protective machineries and is also available for & Linux. but it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the losses in the notebook and 46% for working systems. at notebooks, the proportion of theft already amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than the seas. it leads to a lower damage, as for example theft or re-installation. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users know only very few viruses and under & Linux; for a long time no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than EXT3, Exser, JFS and XFS to call the common filesystem. a very good English article can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden break during an operation is higher and an indefinable status is avoided. however, a file has not been completely saved before the problem came, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft, and human defects are the major causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings of fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology is further developed, there is a natural limit for these progress. sensitivity and noise for all types of light sensors are not far away from this border.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras are in the direction of 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras, and high-quality optics are the optimisation for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have their border with 10-12 Megapixel. even DSLR cameras have your border with 10-12 Megapixel. for higher resolution you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">A 750GB hard drive is available today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone responsible for data loss. so, do not guarantee your data after a plan and test them before you do something dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of boards or the size of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make daily your backups on an external board drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes, you are lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster suggests local and destroys a lot. don't forget airmail: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, Desastervorsprung always means a local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a frequent reason for a loss of data, despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save the one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at one time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup should be changed. creates a complete snapshot of two times: the complete backup and that of the last differential treatment.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. create several moments. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made. this backup comes up to a versioning system closest with the exception that is just being refused and not ongoing.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool you can easily set up on your machines. unlike the script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transcription copies rsync only the difference of files that really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Ensure important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to discover losses and restore it. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. every additional outfertilization should be done manually, after which you have a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file stored IPTC information, original XMP files, originating, memory, scalability, media, re-finding pictures and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images will survive the next 40 year that about the time period in which you really are interested in you because they remember your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable because of your nature you'll have to look with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other option to be compatible with caution. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system downwards. the less variations you have used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to reading your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the Council is quite simple: everytime you change your computer architecture, your memory and safety technology, or change your file format, you should review your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the subject area for the possibility to change a system in its size. this is actually getting bigger.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have already planning the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition. in * nix systems such as & Linux; you can copy this area and transfer the onto a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected from the system, but do not attach them one.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiron if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software anymore you can read, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">Gif is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was used as an open source standard of the GIF. however, it can save a lot more. it's loss-free, supported XMP, Exinf and chromatical data for enhanced colour information, but not as many as TIFF requires and slow adjustment. this format we would like to recommend to store your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as picture format. TIFF can store images in high quality, but requires very large files. with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format. however, a problem is that this format is adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative file format is a licence-free and open-screen format that has been developed by Adobe Systems. DNG was already developed on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. the DNG was already available and we hope to use the competitors of Canon and Nikon.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology, a mixture of XML and RDF. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata platform., a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is available with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; saved for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive their intake, mostly in the raw format, since it saves the metadata seperately from the image file. therefore, you should think about problems in the link between the Metadata and the image file. therefore, you should think about whether you use DNG as containers and put everything there together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards, which is a large area of operating purposes and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures on the camera code are, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save it in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing process, you can use external programs. if you're using the pictures again with your checking, then you should add metadata again. these were under circumstances cut from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only then into web galleries, or add in MPEG, use in contact sheet, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to add your photos online. in the section insertion of an album you'll have a description of how you can have photos, which you already have on your hard disk, but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase available.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with your desk, connect it to the machine, switch the camera on the display mode and switch it up. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect with your camera. for some cameras that can be a while. some cameras show no thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for file order for each file, photos, movies, music etc. on the camera display.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information about each entry. with the page features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the characteristics of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file features and the photographic information that is stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. please note that some digital cameras do not have any information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata shows the internal metadata like EXIF, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. this information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of the screen; or image processing. note that these metadata for some digital cameras are not available.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & desk;. downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to verify that the pictures can be downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired using the default option methods of & kde; as soon as you selected the photos, use the button download and then download the selected download. the button-chosen is loaded until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option is new to download. these images have not been downloaded from & Check. in this case, the new images have been marked with a star in the showcase. if you choose this option, of course, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons, you can download or download the selected album, a dialogue with which you can select the target album in which the photos are sorted. the list of existing albums is displayed, as normal folder, you can read the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you selected the target album, press OK, and download it, loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once, by using the button Delete all. if you only want to delete some you, you must select them first and delete it by deleting.</seg>
<seg id="260">Note that there are no possibility of recreating photos which you deleted from the camera. so the photos are not deleted in the dustbin of & kde; therefore, they should carefully checked whether the photos were successfully deleted from the camera. if you want to delete it from the camera, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras are often used as filenames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the filenames are usually processed once the photos are deleted from the camera. therefore, it can be useful to load the date and the time when the image was made to integrate into the filenames.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the image and for data-based undermines. if you use this latter option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options, while transmission opens three more options that are done before the photos on the record are stored. the first two concern the data about the author in the section standard car identity. if you choose this, the corresponding entries are copied from the EXIF information in the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct the date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish to use another file format as the standard format, you can use for example in the editing field the prefix photo -%%% H:% M:% S. turn the option date & time to add. for further adjustments you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera file, you have the option to change the filenames in small letters. or in large letters if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digitised, is shown below the name, which the camera is available in the preview. your settings to rename will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera display next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& Check out; can use all information about the orientation of the camera for the time recording, to complete automatic rotation during downloading. not all cameras will provide information. in the section names Metadata you can read more details, about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not supply this information, the photo is in the original orientation. if you want the automatic rotation off, use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotating in the bottom range of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera information about the date, where the photo was made available, you can download it; this undermine are based on the image data. all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras are available in the same subalbum. in the section names meta data you can check out what information your camera can be embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, the photo shoot. the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change it, you need to switch this option. use the button Reference and select the option-based undermine at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is the button download. then select the files you can select the files you are to be uploaded. you can also select more than one file containing the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the picture selection is done, asking & management came; you, where the images are to be loaded up. a folder-selection dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to restart the high-load. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. it is a position that can be displayed in longitude and latitude, which can be shown on a map. determining the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European Galileo or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers can make it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an aircraft to be an area by automatic uptake of GPS data to kartograficties. environment planner, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents may use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten later, where exactly the photo was done, you can start with a click of a browser which indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & contractor; users want to send the location of the photos, or simply document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data come into the image? first you should know that exiv2 many GPS data fields, such as direction, semites and card references are supported. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via a editing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical assignment (manual) and finally about the manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there are currently no camera, which has a GPS unit, but there are a few that work with GPS receiver. either as a card module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to store this data in the gpx format since this is the only format supported by the module to the geographical assignment.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, extract data from images and from the GPS and correlate it correlated. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; psCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitudinal and latitude or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the default characters, e.g. from maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.n.shows no European road cards. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& I came to give you so much control over his work flows as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of images. change to the Settings menu is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Action can be selected on embedded preview or image processing. you place the default behavior of & management, fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the Standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IPTC data fields, when the option was chosen for downloading from the camera type. also with a database synchronization, these data are written in the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Authortitle is a synonym for author: this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer. these can be designations like e.g. Anke photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a further description about the author, this field must be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for supplier: use this field to display the display of the photo. this does not have to be the author if this is an image agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here, then the group or agency should be displayed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC fields. it is achieved that the metadata are constantly included in the picture and not only came in the data base. these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported in & download; imported, without having lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Image shoftings as embedded signposts (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synced the comments that you add to your photos, with the images embedded in the pictures. caution: in pictures that have already been marking, these by the pictures already occurred; overridden.</seg>
<seg id="290">The page settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse-cursor in the main window on a file rests. depending on the chosen option, this information will be displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; publication came; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which data types & management came; to indicate, you can add the file expansions of this list; Albany folders, which has no one of these extensions, ignored and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Realize right from each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminance of & digitised, can be set on this page to the default values. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. the option & quot; In the whole image type ladenquot; if you have one, then you can hereby receive better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, the editing process uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can switch the toolbar if you use the image editing in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image editing, this picture mode can be used with F10 and F11 and switched off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma Subsampling is meant that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia about the nearing explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">By setting PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality because PNG requires a loss-free algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to high compression. it means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF files, you can switch the deflate compression salesperm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the deflate algorithm loss is free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the adjustment of loss-free JPEG-2000 files you can save loss-free. even if you choose the loss of loss, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, Metadata were not yet supported, but was in the planning process.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the previous versions of & download, the image processing was only a picture-view for photos. currently it quickly develops into a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of the picture editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard process is that all green pixels are identical. if you use this option on ultraviolet light, this difference creates a weight pattern in output. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimum loss of details. this option makes the picture a little soft, but eliminated the 2x2 Geys with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white slippery is used in the camera. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white cover is not set. standard it is a fixed color balance, which was shot on a white map that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors, the effect of the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps more details into the shrelights. for other cameras this option will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the shrelichter, so the parts of your camera is burned down, due to the inability of your camera to view the nickname. finally, use the adjustment finishes in various Roskilns. finally, you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast shady as green and red. & as came; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green pixel and red-proportions of the still not saturated blue pixel. of course, this is a question of how much colour or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">Selecting the option to reconstruct the option you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Put the Luminale value according to your taste. you probably need to put it slightly higher than the standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & claim; image processing can be done. in order to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed more conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to get a complete image from the sub-filtered image sensor, which have many cameras and is made available to a Matrix coloured pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA Interpolation or Color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& desk came, and Dcraw provide you three alternatives available: Bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation (Variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it produces colobartefacte at the edges. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color-deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue-proof values here. this is certainly the best method for a coloring correction, since you are carried out during the shell.</seg>
<seg id="312">One profile translates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given again. there are also LCMS and & management came; information such as color information to be translated from a color foam in the others are thereby the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behaviour questions, if an image is opened in the image editing / color administration module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Setzen the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you all save your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed while opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Color Manager view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your images are colorfully managed not the whole screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Input profiles should be used to the camera writer and model that you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not contain color mapping modules at 16 bit depths. this means that you do not have to carry the paint mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the soft-Proof-profile, with which you can emulate how your image has been given from one device. this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore very saturated with it. this could manually fix you instead of leaving on the graphical algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most of the cameras, it is rather obvious which colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile expands the style for the goal: F for an exact style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image Plugin Interface. it is an interface which is supported by a number of & kde; image considering and image editing; many modules support that have been written to work with each program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you can see a list of available modules. select the files you want to use, and these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short command for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under settings short command.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the diaschau should be easy to understand. the top regulator jushes the time between the image outputs, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other interstickers turn the metadata or that are displayed at the lower end of the pictures during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">Camera properties show on the left side of a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right side there is a button automatic detection, which is trying to identify the camera properly, switched on and in image mode. currently there are the portals. currently here are serial, USB- and USB / FireWire mass storage.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the lower end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) storage cameras from the camera. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt /, in which you specify your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with your desk, you need to connect the camera to your computer to switch it into the display mode.</seg>
<seg id="329">Try out if & order came; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you set up your camera, your camera appears in the menu camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option Configuration dialog for relocating &gt; images in the dustbin, you can set the conversation of a photo; when deleting a photo in an album. deleting the pictures and deletion of an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be tacitly used, when you use the option to use the option changes in the right sidebar. otherwise, you need to use the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also set the display of the welcome screen from & desk; at starting point, this will speed up the start process from the digitised.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting of Beim starts to search for new photos. this prolongs the base folders after new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the starting folder after new or deleted albums / pictures. if something was deleted from the base folder, you ask, whether it should delete it from the base.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different shades of colors can be used in & digitised, to adjust the main window to your tastes. these settings can be selected under settings design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & management; to create, you will find more information about this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& management came; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools. you can use these to view your photos and for correcting and improvement. image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu, the preview and selection of the advertisements.</seg>
<seg id="338">The editing process contains a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & download; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules you will find in the section image editing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, enlarging factor and the actual image size shows.</seg>
<seg id="340">A toolbar at the top of the top and below the toolbar to quick access to the most frequently used functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing may alter your photos. however, no of the functions will change the original photo before you store the file, save file or save the toolbar. note that you can restore the original shot no more as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. you can save it by saving.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you do not have saved the photo, you can restore the original image by filling out the menu file Restore in toolbar. you then lose any change that you have done in the photo since last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action allows you to undo revert back-running and reinstated by selecting reproducing reproducing from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for the backend and make Ctrl; -Shift-Z for reproducing.</seg>
<seg id="346">When you select the & LMB; over the runway or Restore button in the toolbar, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all the actions are reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you start the editing process, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation apps in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the menu file. if you have made changes in the current photo, you will be asked if you want to store them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo in and out zooming in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the port.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in toolbar: enlarging factor automatically.</seg>
<seg id="350">View full-screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Escape key. usually, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not wish, you can view this from the introductory dialog of the screen. see this you can call the section for setting the image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current picture, you can print in the File menu and get the standard & kde; pressure dialog. you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print single images or whole sentences. whole picture pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the default methods and select from the album Expore print assistant. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digipanel arrived; main window has a sidebar on the right edge, which provides important information and promotions for the selected images. the same page bar is available without the navigation device, also available in the image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked.</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same rider lets the sidebar appear or disappear in the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the description, you can insert or insert swiss with unlimited size or insert. note: the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are permitted. the signposts are copied into the EXIFT and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are written randomly. if you want to use the IPTC description field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After having commented on it, you either use the button users or simply change the next image, the signposts are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Besides the application button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also choose the metadata to the files. this is always done when you choose a metadata setting, which is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating evaluation shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in seeking and sorting line. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars on the sidebar, or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. the evaluation out of the sidebar is applied only to one image at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keywords review shows a search box to the filtering the keywords, the keywords and a combo box with the keywords previously published in this & order; session laid out keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keywords will dynamically adjusted to the search word. you can restrict the number of options in finding a keyword quickly. this ability is particularly useful when you have a lot of keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered various keywords, these are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by flagging of appropriate tenths in the tree. all tags of an image are stored into the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view, and you select a keyword in the keywords, this is only applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, If you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The sidebar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the displayed pictures displayed in the main window. usually, the left sidebar is used with their album, - columns, sampling, and search points. if in addition one or more sampling filters are used in the right-hand side, only the intersection of these two displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and discard it. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears if you want to put the buzzword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the top example, the main window shows the pictures on a calender date. the keyword filter is reduced to no keywords, which has been selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword has been selected from the right key-tree to the selection and sat down. a dialog asks if this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. you can also be deleted under settings different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule and created and find that it should be or should be, you can easily change it with a double-click on the text and control.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry in which the database is searched for. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator, which is a name or string, is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set a search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the crosscamp at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr does not listed? the free space is restricted to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly found it at & desk; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colours used by your camera or scanner is a predictable deviation from the actual pictures or scanned colors. with a colorful workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor those from your camera or scanner and that the colors you print from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the subject is at paint management, everyone wants to know which buttons it needs to provide for the results he wants. unfortunately, the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color administration. additionally, links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all of the criteria listed in the workflow, you don't have to worry about color administration.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB color foam. (more information can be found below)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other shots are per email or the web where sRGB of de-facto standard is.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life for all so easy, why should one use another color space and thus have to worry about color managers?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colours which we can see, the fiery-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB Farbraum, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some bigger color spaces, please visit Bruce Lindblooms excellente page and click on information and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to illustrate my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB Farbraum?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you're working in sRGB colouring or not, you need to edit your monitor, since sRGB equates that your; onitor on sRGB, then you need to either use your monitor on sRGB standard, a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before trying to get an additional manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, the same, automation and contrast concreased out of the menu Creating Automatic correction automatically try to make the best of your colors. they will be experimenting with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method will scale the luminaires across the image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible will change without its color shades. this function is often a magnet correction for images the dark or washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">The same: this method jushes the illuminance factor of the colours of the selected image, so that the Histograms of the Intensity is as flat as possible. sometimes, the equivalent amount of good results in improving the contrasts of an image, sometimes it also produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful surgery which either causes miracle in a picture or it destroys.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic shutters: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green and blue channel. it identifies the dark and bright bordertones and jushes the red, green- and blue channels on the complete histograms.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method enhances the contrast and luminosity of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new jibish values in between. this is only visible in shaded pictures and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white off from & desk came; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white-off of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white-white correction is a bit limited because of a color tree with 8-bit per color. if you can therefore view too far from the original image, areas with overexposure function can be performed, which works in the 16-bit mode, so your ways to correction is better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white-synonymous extremism that is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it above the menu-entry colors white off the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The showcase can be customized in size. on the left hand side both the original image and preview of the target image. preview is dynamically adjusted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original whichless then it is enough to click the window window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview photos feature a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as vertical line in the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="399">To the right above is a Histogram indicated that as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful because, even in well illuminated images, most pixels very small Luminate values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is indicated. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your outcome depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade of the shadow allows you to improve the shadow-details of your photos or also for realising.</seg>
<seg id="401">Anstat with the above controls can be done, you should use the color temperature-pipette. press to this button and then anywhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white matter. this way also the temperature and green -values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white off with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than a color channel of the pixels overexposed. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture.</seg>
<seg id="404">The buttons are storing and loading accurately this. any attitude of the white cover you have set is allowed to save you into a text file and later load again.</seg>
<seg id="405">The button-preferences sets out all filter values again to their standard values and the associated neutral white-comparison. note that also neutral settings will emerge another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the code width per color channel of the beworked image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better for high-quality images. this coding is also needed for the formats of PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be carried out by the sub-window for the use of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be seen in the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors sound value. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistake and you always need the same correction. in the manual to tone corrections, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option of correcting problems is to correct the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The download effects; tool fuse effects will provide you with four wheels, a solar effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cantons filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar thermal, even Sabatier was created, an effect of the recorded photocopies created by the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar heating. at approx. 50% intensity shows the image what chemically possible. an additional increase finally generates a negative picture that is not to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar effect. the original image is (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter is simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation effect that he has a stronger contrast-effect, which makes the colors brilliant and smooth. try it simple, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on the daylight reflecting color movie made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvet offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make him a movie by the choice for nature photography. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some photographies, especially those who hardly escape landscapes are too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter is simulates Neonlight on the contrasting. the parameter Level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlichts. in large pictures the filter can trigger the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color counter and the luminosity of your photo. you can change the different color bases of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be satisfied in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a good choice to reduce the saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can be able to increase. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminous / contrast / gamma, the tool is very complicated for improving exposure. even if the dialogue at this tool is very complicated, need for the specified application purpose only the area of the slider. concrete the three shooting below the histograms.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the Intensity values, an active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three slider into the inside, and which can be moved to change the intention of the picture. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to postpone the regulator and to look at it as the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the picture, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this combo can be set whether the histograms is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for pictures of a digital camera, linear representation is commonly dominated by a single column. in this case, the logistical Histograms will be useful by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic organization is useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulator: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright notes, and the lowest for the middle notes, often called Gamma.org.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color brush can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the cause of the shadow, middle and bright notes automatically. furthermore, there is a button for full automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Payouts include the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two regulators that can be used to change the intermittent interactive as for the intervention. for example, the compression of the gastric can be used for example to create a hidden image as a background while something else is to be seen in the background.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values will automatically be placed depending on the intensity of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and store: with these buttons, the displayed values can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded on it. in addition, the Gimp levels will be used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three colour pipallets, the input data is automatically diffused for all shadows, means and solar moisture. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the use of the Histogramms for rotary, green-, blue and the luminous channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The option overbelating indicator control controls all color channels to see above-coated pixels and show you the combined results of all channels. this is a indication that you only see the effect displayed in the preview and it's not a result in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the intervention applied to the red, green and blue channel of an photos. intensity and Alpha channel, as well as the exterminations are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original is displayed as well as the target image. preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right hand, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifying channel: this selbox allows to specify the channel that is altered by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this casket there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures that have been recorded with a digital camera, linear mode is most sensual. in this case, the logarithmic mode generates.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you turn a spa rope to the right, e.g. the bright notes, then you can see that these bright tones with darker exhausts are corresponding and that the associated pixel-pixel will be darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Shown on the original photos is a red marker. if you want to change this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve, which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it down and down until the value is credited to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and store: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each bend that you have created can hereby be stored in the filesystem and later loaded on. the file format is Gimp is the Gimp format.</seg>
<seg id="438">When you use this method and the three colours buttons, automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow, central and Sundays. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green-, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The option overloaded simultanator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined end result. this is what you see the effect only displayed in the preview and it's not a result in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun-leaning was placed with the color piquette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel-blender of the & management came; image processing is a tool to enhance the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel blender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel-blender of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel elector you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note as you can fix the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left side of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to its own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The display of the target image has a red marker. if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the histogram to show you the appropriate color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are to the right below: regulator for red, green and construction allow you to mix the overall brightness. this is particularly convenient when you also use the appropriate color components. this is particularly convenient when you can also use the appropriate color component. try the green canal for generating great black-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green canal for black-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrom, leads the reduction of a color to a visible smoking, which occurs from small predators who appear not at the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern look different in every channel. if that's the case, you can improve your monochrom conversion to which you reduce the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">Storing and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer settings allows you to save for later and then load. the used file format is the Gimp-channel blender format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The option overbelating indicator control controls all color channels to see above-coated pixels and show you the combined results of all channels. this is a indication that you only see the effect displayed in the preview and it's not a result in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is newly built. the original image is activated (1) and the original image is under (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white a working step, as color pictures can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film-rollers.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford, 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film object with a green lime filter. this looks good at all the scene images and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) Green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filtered: simulates a black / white film coating with a orange lindfilter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and air photos. so similar to 002 Cokin (tm) orange filtered.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film object with a red lenticular filter. this creates a dramatic impact-effects and can simulate any moonations for day-time. so much like the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film object with a yellow Linsenfilter. this is the most natural shade-correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) Geltfilter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: creates warm bright and middle notes while he adds a bit of cold in the slums and re-development in a Sepiphoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the digitias; tool texture, you can apply decorative textures to an image.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, no matter if it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the thrust of an old master, a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a wall image on a wall. the menu entry image texture can be used for this.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: postpone this parameter to the right increases the impression of the depth and the three-dimensionality of texture in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied on the photo below. the original image is (1) and it changed under (2). the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the digitised, tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to an image.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a spectator in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. an opportunity to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye. under picture frame the module can be started out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired folding type for your image. going through a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-white images), abbreviated it with a nice three-dimensional frame of the ideal is for a bone effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: indicates the width of the frame in percent. the range for width varies from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">That with the frame image will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for print the images, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this practical tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture in any position. this will also work in multiple places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text excerpt, orientation, color from the color foam and the character set with its characteristics as you need. the larger the picture, the larger the character set must be. to conclude, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-sighted background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you hit the button "OK" after the picture was saved, the text is part of the picture. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the creator; tool stencil uses you to put a template on one image.</seg>
<seg id="470">The menu image Schablone apply in the editing process can be used to put sablons over an image.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the stencil there are no restrictions on the size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should be associated with maximum compression (9) for the reduction of file size. if you want to add your stencil files, send an e-mail in English to the files; mailinglist, came-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set up your template folder with the button basis folder in dialogue. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings are noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder set for the stencils, a construction view, which reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder updates the thumbnails of the stencils automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview you can find three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your picture.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob is enlarged the underlying picture. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Downsize: this button shrinks the underlying picture. if you want to apply the template to the full picture, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the image and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">OK, if you want to apply the template on your image. the image will then be adapted to the thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="479">& As came, three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpened is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark fields, calamantine images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharfe mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually it's not a bit, it works rather psychologically-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunars and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since he really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital pictures require a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the digitalization process colors put together with minimal differences to a colour point. this in turn leads to a bit blurred edges with just minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG-pictures often a camera has been applied internally. images in the rough format, on the other hand, must always be lubricated in during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners have a sharpened filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable this, you get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get beneficial results by having a photo with the sharpened value. you can also call it with the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should avoid caution because the results are not very natural: the sharpened increases the edge of the edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is the tool refocus. you can find further more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too cracky. the solution to draw the image a little soft, is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for softsign with the menu entry. use the thumbnail on the right side of the dialogue shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the showcase clearly shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two major parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often create good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or the amount will enhance the effect. if you make the impending mask to strong, smokers and the impression of grats close by sharp edges are creating.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is just how many pixels on each page are affected by the filter. high resolution images allow greater radiators. they should therefore raise pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is placed.</seg>
<seg id="494">The swelling is a breach of the maximum RGB value and the difference differential. one can thus define a minimum difference in order for a sete of filters. in this way areas are avoided with a soft change between the tones of sharpenalties and therefore beauty defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masking has been applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sellvalue = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The management came; tool refocus refocusing an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Open-Filter algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to create an image & quot; it's a better approach than just trying to raise the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. refocus is usually achieved better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by using colors refocus in the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Faltung works much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel, which depends far from the original-source pixels. however, the FIR Wiener inverse the gauzes folding cartels is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixel. it causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the main parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value should put 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very unsharp, but then note on halves.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: increasing the correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & g; 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Smoking filters: an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 is rarely helpful. if the smoke filter is too low, & win; 0 the image quality is very poor. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will be added to the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauge's sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge's sharpness. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value equal to zero, you might also have to raise the correlation and / oderthe noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of Transformationsmatrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you choose big values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness. however, note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the area of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">Storing and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any any refocus parameters you have set will be stored for later and can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all the cutting, color and intensity structures on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but which left untreated artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you want to read images and compress, & eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module onto the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally produces unsharp masking produce better results as raising. this could be caused to be the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood as acuity.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, it has to be crisp. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of the sharpness. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal linear filter. virtually the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is at least as good as the impending mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in handling small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filtering, on a small and focused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image has to be corrected. this picture was taken with an analogous camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for auto focus lenses.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information about the methods of sharpening in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The regulator Gwels puts the unsharpness of the zone that has been obscured in order to generate a natural Pupille.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tints allows a adapted color for the Pupille. if you want to use blue eyes instead of dark, then you can set it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired artifacts with unparalleled speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The algorithm algorithm was developed by IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to finalize the filter settings, you can use the horsemen smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail posture [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an equitable smoothing over the image. weighed upon bigger values, mainly homogeneous regions, and details sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details so that no sharpened protection should be subordinated. please note that the details of the details always be subordinated.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction addictions Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooth evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie casses, or CCD smoke will create a high value wavelike patterns. JPEG artifacts are best viewed with a value close to 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum value factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is done, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbulb effect, it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually, here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-wide as [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha small is chosen, should be small as well. be sure that small angles should produce a long term. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral part [0,1, 10]: integral stride-wide into pixel. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the More Quality that you get through the choice of this option is only small, but it doubles its running time. therefore we recommend it to allow him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons are storing and loading accurately this. any setting of image errors can hereby be saved into a text file and can be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a very long time and a high CPU load to move. you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how picture error was taken with small artifacts. the module is applied in a photo that in Guatemala city was done with an analogous camera. as you see there is a peculiar black artefacts in the foreground, that caused by a bad film storage during the trip, the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitisation came; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce images. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filter to remove stains and other artifacts e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor from the camera or moist; -effects from scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need further information on sensoric cameras of digital cameras, you can read this in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot shows a typical scene which was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a basal noise which can be successfully removed from this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you will only need the subwindow details and the program's advanced settings may remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is required per pixel and can cut the image through the radius and the color in it is smooth and thus harassed minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness. this value sets the pixelabut to determine the luminance alterations. if it is raised, smoke detective. you need to change the edges filter at the front. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer get and detach or lubricate again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the cantonal accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong cannot occur the total noise or smoke-tips can occur. put it down to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a slim smoking or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance field of the image. we recommend you to either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the process of the board process controlled by the details configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color intolerance of the picture. we recommend you to either change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the process of the board process controlled by the details configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerances of the darker areas, which typically are more predatory, but it also handles the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Absorption: controls the alignment of the phasenjitteriness. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is reacted on variations of luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear to occur if it is too high, can remove noise and phasenjitter on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and loading: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters for smoking reduction, which you have set, can be stored in the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too cracky for your purpose. fortunately, the image is a little soft to draw. fortunately, you can draw a bit easier than an image. use the tool for softsign with the menu entry. use the thumbnails on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The effect came; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photographic work.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove the Gauß'n noise, movies, compression artefacte and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images to remove. the smoothing is done along the contours and thus keeps the content as it makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the material composition is performed with another tool, the image error, the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franní and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a loss of compression saluted, he creates some compression & quot; artifacts quot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons are storing and charging exactly this. every setting of photo restoration can hereby be saved into a text file and be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it may take a very long time and a high CPU load to move. hence, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce as a photo with like-shaped noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si cam at an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with an sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious movie casses on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures can be reduced to an old color photograph, which was created with a scanner device. you can see the Scan-artifacts caused by the scannerlighting and the photopapier. the original image is under (1) to see and corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The document arrived; tool Hotpixels allows to remove hotpixel of photos showing with a CCD camera, eight were to be removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickens.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixel are particularly high in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras are equipped with JPEG compression about a built-in repression of hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to delete & quot; name is pixelquot; and "quot; bright pixel-quot; on a photo with a dark-screen subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file into the wizard with the button of the dark. the tool will automatically identify the hot and bright pixel. these are highlighted in the picture preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it's important to record the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the appropriate dark picture to the corrected image. an automatic processing of the dark becomes the bad pixel. please note that the assistant notice the last dark picture and that automatically loads this automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The picture area and the preview help you correct the result within the image. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to pollint these pixelblocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: it becomes an average of the neighboring pixels. the resulting color will be assigned to all the broken pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance from 1 from the pixelblock are set up to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (1-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to polate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default method of default. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixelblock will be drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim).</seg>
<seg id="564">Kubically: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are pulled up to calculate a bi-cuban interface (2-dim) or a group of cuban curves (1-dim), which is then used to polate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hottest correction of a coloring photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see. the original image was enlarged on 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitifying correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Forwinder lenses, in particular the middle and large photoformat, can frequently illuminate the entire sensor area. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaking) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by putting the light to the sensor there. Telelenses show also this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many Center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter, which is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. Wiwinder lenses should also use with Center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller since otherwise unsharpenned effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the big exposure areas of today's film and the shades of digital cameras and film scanner, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by making an equivalence transformation in a shell that is applied without this filter. the tool Vignettifying correction is applied to a picture. the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three reglers you can control the vignettize filter and with three further the exposing of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light damper on the spot of the greatest density the filters. the default density is 2.0, which allows an optical filter with a blending point of 1, or randomly a luminosity of 2, spellur.Increase the density to compensate a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it to compensate for a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Luminosity, contrast and gamma settings: the editing of an image with the vignettifying correction is lessening the exposing of the target with these options. the regulator will only provide positive values, as you only need to increase settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a subtle re-adjusting the exposing of the target image, so let the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the bed. image processing from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a lamp-stronger and contraction was also performed with the image using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitix came; linear distortion is a tool to correct the effect of celestial lenses on photos. it uses a copyright algorithm of David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colourless distortions can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second counts covers the general geometric distortion of the lens, and can correct the concave or concreexe shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third Grades has a similar roundeffect, flacht however on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grader corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Grades. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of the distortion of the second Grades. with negative values, tonical distortions can be corrected and positive values are hoverted distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of the distortion fourth grades. this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners' parameters set the reverse parameters the reverse parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value newts the size of the size and thus leads to the correction of the first Grades. negative values enlarge while positive the picture is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value jushes the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values they increase.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, illustrated the dialog with a preview the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be stored and used at the next start as standard values.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tons. or hoverular correction should be carried out in front of all trimmers or size changes. best do this correction as all the first. if you would like to re-cut a picture and then perform a tonical correction, the effect would be obvious to the wrinkles.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction to you, this tool introduces you to an important place, such as the marine edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. afterwards, you can fix the tons. / hoverular distortion using the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a hoverular distortion, the resulting image is black corners. you can remove it with the cutting tool in the Transform menu, or remove it from the image processing or through the zoom reels of this dialogue.</seg>
<seg id="588">For most images the tonbinical correction is made. the next logical step for some motives, frames and paintings, it's the perspective to correct that all angle in the picture 90 degrees. keep in mind when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method of simulating infrared movie by the GimpGuru.org web page. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared movie, see this URL. this film has a awareness of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can simulate a movie casses and sensitiveness (ISO) option if you want to simulate the granate texture of a highly sensitive movie. ISO regulator changes the quantity of the movies and the dominance of colour green (chlorophyll in nature) in the transformation. green meadows are white as snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter colour channels to reproduce by infrared film, especially the green canal makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs, as the colorbinary information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infra-filtering effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensation of the movie was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a sort of aura in the shutter.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digitike came; filter filmmaking is an easy to use tool to reproduce film baskets to your images. this is known from classic high-speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X, to increase the sensation of the movies and the manufacturers of large silver-baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The cinematic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere of daily life. if you want to use this specific, gallery-like, street photographic view, specially in your monochroms photos, so you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With regulator the ISO-sensitivity can be adjusted to control the intensity and granularity of the granules. the default value is, although frequently higher values are needed, on ISO-2400. if you need any more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the cloister effect on a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and the processed (2). the used film-sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The barge came; filter oil paintings produced the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digitised, filter oil painting are a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and styles are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two regulators to influence this effect. the top choose the brush-size between one and five out. thicker brushes are better for big images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, seen from the other side, the texture.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and that is working with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & management came; Filters Kohledrawing uses color and Intensive gradient to create a cognancy in drawing. these lines which change the outlines in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it's helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to outline what scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two regulator with a value-range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the top regulator chooses the pin size and the lower jushes the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of coherent filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be improved by adapting the Intensive value still further.</seg>
<seg id="606">The deposit came; Filter engraving defines your image in 3-D, as if it was stacked in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & download came; Filengraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. he works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monotonous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth it allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds 10%, is the default.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave-blocks 1: shares the image in cells and let it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave-blocks 2: analogue to the wave-blocks 1 will distorts the image here with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load. you can break these effects anytime with the button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filtering group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of imshark effects. it uses copyright protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom insharfe: blurred the image along a star-shaped lines that go from a central point. this simulates the sharpness a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of often visible in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial imbalance: blurred the image through rotation of the pixels to a central point. this simulates the wrapping of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Removal of removal: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Movement-sharpness: blurred the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the imsharpness of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft shims: blurred the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this produces photos with a dreameric and shiny moving effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or add a warm and subtle firefusal.</seg>
<seg id="620">Chills: blurred the image through random shift of the pixels and simulates the ounce of an arbitrary movable camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent filtering: finds the chilling in the image and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: shares the photo in rectangular cells and created it then, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="624">The Regentropes are a nice small tool to make regentropes on your image. this gives it natural your pictures a wet look. it uses a Pieter Voloshyn protected algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Dripping size allows the size of the drip to change. as the size size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the amount and density of drops. fishness changes the optical effect of drops in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free from regentropes. use the tool to select the area, e.g. a face, which should remain free. if you start the filter Regentropes, the area will remain free from regentropes.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the rain drops. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the painted image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the standard values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or rotating in the correct orientation. you can also find the tools in the Transforform menu or transforms.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo magnified is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">A picture of downsize is simple. the big question is how can you find a picture bubbles and the details sharp? how can you invent the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes it a good work. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transforms size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialogue is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change a linear Interpolation method to join the pixels. if you want to increase a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spine interpolation for enlarge an image. & management came; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must say the tool as you want to change the size. these settings are available in rider New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Aspect ratio kept: if this option is activated, when entering the new size, the aspect ratio is the original image.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is done, as it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbulenzberg ', it must be higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">Buttons are storing and charging will be used exactly as a text file can be saved as text file and can be loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo shocks is very fast with what it does, but it can still take a very long time and a high CPU load to move. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of picture flashes, adding a small paint image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear adjustment Enlargement to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">The cutting of a photo is not only a common surgical procedure, but also a commonly underestimated tool to cut a picture. image processing permits it very easy. to cut a photo with the mouse, press the mouse button and drag the rectangle, then you'll see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">If you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo is cut off. you can change the size of the box by pulling in the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle allows you to simply drag it up with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting-section, use the button Bcutting button in toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl; + X). use the file to save or save file to save the photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the thumbnails, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio, which you have defined in dialogue will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After side ratio, you can specify the orientation as high-format or cross-format. in the high-format the greater value of height and width-format is assigned to width.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool After side-relationship uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always equal, regardless of whether you're using centimeters, ink or any other physical size. you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for photopapier and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialogue, two buttons exist around the selection automatically horizontal or vertical.</seg>
<seg id="647">Down in the dialog, you can use the Max. relationship button to cut the range to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool After side-relationship cut its settings depending on the orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you are using the cutting tool for the next time, these settings are stored as default measurements displayed in the EXIF tables, allowing the EXIF data to reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the co-operation assistance allow you to initiate help, so that you can put your images better together. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. as the third party rule, harmonic triangles have a possibility to share a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden middle is a division into different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus pussy or the leaf blades of a sunflower. it emerges in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1.618033988... and it was already used with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed to build your temples and pyramids. artists and architects made the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number leads from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. from where each number is after 1 equal to the sum of their two preceding numbers. the abandoned ponds is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that is followed as visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden middle provides liquid aid lines when you put a picture together. these assistance will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirals will bring you good results for your photos closer. compared to third party rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the gaze of the spectator along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual river.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the justification of the golden spiral, even golden riangles. these justification are used to create the golden spiral. this may be a line or different objects. this something can be simply because without the eye to guide it will fulfil its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also leading from above. their vertices are the midpoints of the side of the golden area. keep in mind that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are not equivalent to these lines to place a static object.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use Golden triangles to break up your frame create a effect that is called by professional photographers dynamic Symmetrie. try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal reflect and tread can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with lots of colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to turn a picture to turn any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you do a photo, then it happens easily that you are not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which the things turned around a angle. you can fix this with the digitised, image processing and the tool free rotation. select transforms free rotation and adjust to the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Turn your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slider are specified in degrees. with the button preference, you can put the slider back to 0 degree. a preview is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">To your help, the module Free Rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after you fix it via an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now, you can fix the angle like in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">Once you have shot a picture you'll find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. a way to repair it is the function transforms to use the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the function Automatically cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The option for anti-aliasing is the picture a bit after the rotation. however, please note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All the speculative transformations are carried out around a point of view to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares in the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically calculated. on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixel.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the level of the new image, including the empty spaces created by the transformation into pixel.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformer area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformer area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformer area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformer area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After the adaptation of the perspective, the image becomes a bit wasted. for a single adaptation this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After leaving the perspective you will get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. a way to bersome it is the image with transforms cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool-tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal scattering example will move the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted in a parallelogram. you can launch this module about transforms.</seg>
<seg id="679">Use your image by using the horizontal angles and the vertical angle. you can press horizontal and vertical angle. if you press to presets, the angles will be displayed on zero. a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are shown on the right of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line is bundled. move the mouse to an important point, like e.g. the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tooling tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have carried out the shearing, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single layer, this effect is usually negligible, but two flocks are twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After draining the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove this is to cut the image with transforms cutting out of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& management came; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write images. the available formats are therefore hanging from your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiliated. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & digitised.</seg>

<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the Headlines tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original county of Him is: expect of dcraw not that it creates the same results as the software from your camera writer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First, select the RAW file that is to be converted and run the module. the Raw-image konverter window will then appear in the mode for a single picture. with the button preview, you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimise the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are used for the white-white. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue can be amplified. if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG Conversion can be selected, so that you can use the contraction information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion results. the dateiname remains equal and only enlargement will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a loss of loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses the lossfree LZW compressing.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to process your pictures frequently or you later otherwise continue to use the JPEG format, as there are only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is deteriorating. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adapted to your settings, you can start the conversion with the execute button. if you want to break down this process, you can use it.</seg>
<seg id="863">The stack mode allows you to convert different images to one another. therefore, use this mode once you are safe, e.g. by testing in a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The settings available are almost identical with the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to rewrite the existing file automatically. however, a preview is not available. however, the progress bar is not available at how far the conversion progress has been made.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick Package. the following picture formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used for rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the Starnumber and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick Package. you can shrink the image or enlarge. to this end, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is automatically selected, depending on the image orientation, selected. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Do not proportional: disproportionate size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed at this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-preparation: prepare the image for the photo pressure. the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, height and background colour, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the capturing images before. other images can be drawn to the list of capturing images and discard it there.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module the images -window with the pictures selected will be displayed. you can add additional pictures on the button. for the last selected picture, a preview is shown on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures on the picture list and discard it to add a list of images to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="875">"" "the button below will remove images from the list of images that are selected from the list below." ""</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all pictures, the button OK will open the new message to your e-mail clients with the button OK. here you only need to add the addresses and the operator. the pictures selected by you are already attached.</seg>
<seg id="877">Do not make sure to send too many pictures at once. most email accounts have limitations to the size of the e-mails email. it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail clients from the menu. if you choose Thunderbird, you have to specify in the input field below the correct path for your installation.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you need to install the GMailAgent on your computer before. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After the choice of comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail addresses.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to the loss of free formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality should not be modified. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG on images file format, and the original files in the JPEG format are, then the original exifdata is added to the capitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="884">If the process is done, the window will not automatically shutdown so you can look at the status messages, in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end. with the button Inside you can shit this window? en.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diashau a window appears with questions like you have shown your Slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation activates very elegant image outputs by OpenGL. however, you need to possess a corresponding graphic card, as otherwise the diaschau will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The filename option ensures that the filename of images in the lower left corner is displayed during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an Endlosschleife. you can do it manually with Esdec.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images accidentally select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Under delay between pictures can be the temporary distance between the individual images. 1500 milliseconds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends presentation!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitions between which you can choose. randomly, in any transition between pictures you choose another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the Slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the top of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to switch to you.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the lower edge of the screen, you can see the current date, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date jusing currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing these, please contact the mailinglist of the KIPI team at kde-Imaging @ kde.oral warning: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as the background for your KDE industry surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have added your pictures and videos with notes, you can use & UFO album; see picture. as you can see by a comparison with the image, are now in each group, so in people, places and in group keywords entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you'll see the categories for which you have entered information when you look at your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumbnails. in the following each is described for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images shown on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, places and other settings, you can view the thumbnail pictures to see the images of your range.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same icon in front of her name. you can save with & cold album; however, for each person you can have a custom image, of course also for places, keywords and other categories you have defined themselves.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the name, select the button which you want to use right outside on toolbar. please note that you can view the view for each category. that's the advantage that you can see e.g. symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you have no appropriate images).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you don't have to dictate which image to be displayed for each individual person. now you can view the image editor window, as shown in the picture. here you can select the image for choosing the appropriate person. in Ansill Window you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and thus selecting which part of the image should be displayed and cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you access the entry in the main window, a dialog appears that the dialogue for fixing the image properties is very similar. this dialog you can see on the picture once again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the signments or descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text. if you want, you can also specify a date, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can browse all the pictures for certain names as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are shown.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & cold album;. if you do not like to read handbooks, but rather want to try some functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & UFO album; and take a look at the speed screams, the screen photos and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & paste the demo album; and select the demo album in the first dialog box; for the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry into cold album; a number of examples will be loaded and you can try the features of & cold album; try out.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you will find it on the homepage of & Brother album; as an associated HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & cold album; take a look at the timeline. a picture of this list can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline may show you several different periods of time. each list then shows a different unit. you can switch between the units, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline you can use on the following ways: you can choose the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, you'll see the first image of this date in the preview display) and also displays the timeline always shown the current date of the currently displayed pictures, if you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by pressing the mouse button, and the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, so draw the time information. if you select an area, you'll see only images of this timeframe. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& Dingalbum; provide you with two options available to create HTML websites with your images. the one is integrated in & cold album (see). in the following part of the user manual, the integrated version is described in the HTML document.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML-pages you will need to make some settings. these are divided into three areas content, layout and target. in the following, each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the look and a description which is to contain the HTML file later. on cold album; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & cold album; export file is to be seen on the page page. nutritional information about export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information can be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information is displayed by the viewer also without description. please note that & kphotoalbum; currently all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewpoints.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings options are ambiguous, which is why not specifically entered.</seg>
<seg id="923">Down on the page you can set different resolution solutions for the pictures. thus, those who have to view your website and possess a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600, no more images download, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200 have.</seg>
<seg id="924">The observer of your site can change the resolution at any time you have specified. so it can search your pictures with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time, as if he wants to see an image larger, he changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setup area, you place the different folder and the URL, where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best option for all your HTML files will be chosen and set a new subfolder for all your HTML files.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you have to select the main folder in which all your images will be stored. this folder will be automatically added for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a KDE supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your pictures, you can check if these really are all visible for spectator. if you choose the basic folder a URL, a web browser, after the pages created, you should specify this folder. otherwise, the web browser should launch in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you created by you will not have to copy them manually. to allow the import function, see correctly, you have to specify the final target of files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are.</seg>
<seg id="930">The setup options described above have been related to all three base folders and URLs. in this one subfolder will be set, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & D album; come together, you might want to compile a HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already done a lot of time, the image information, persons on the pictures, recording, etc., then you have to make this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. you can import them into your data base. the making properties are imported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in that the images themselves are stored in the file, or if the file is stored in the file, that you have all images together, and that this file can be accessed independently. the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kim file either directly from the File menu file... or together with HTML-Pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the pictures in two ways. first, the pictures are not found in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified in creating the HTML files. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using HTML-Export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, dialogue for exporting images is described, which you can call on the menu file exporting.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialogue is whether to act on internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy the .kim file, you must copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">"" "the" "" "Automatic" "" "option to copy the .kim-file" "" "copy" "" "copy the images automatically for you." ""</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not profitable to compress the files. if you like this, just select the option of export file.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this site is the maximum size size. if you want to send your friends pictures, the .kim file otherwise would be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each picture should be a maximum of 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the .kim from the web browser or from the menu file importers... select & kphotoalbum; the exporting database as described in the import.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant to imports is made of four steps. first you have to select which images you want to import, afterwards, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category persons to the imported file personer (if you are a Dane), while this category needs to be imported to your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window, which categories that should be imported to imported file and which categories do not comply in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to imported file with the categories of your current database. an example of this is shown in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: when you see images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; if you look at the pictures of your Italy's holiday and discover an image with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this guide you will undergo the various steps of (1) fixing the information about your images, about (2) the average and look, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptations.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual, it will be talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kingalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the top folder of its images. this is a simple XML file which you can secure with a program of your choice, e.g. normal backup tools, copy to a floppy disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kingalbum; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used for future Starts. if you want to read a different folder tree with pictures, you can start a different folder tree with images, you can launch a cold album with the option -c. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry settings kphotoalbum; set... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of & D album; in the following section of the user's manual, the different settings options are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you will see six different symbols, with which you can access settings options and the options for the viewer. for each attitude, a detailed help is available, which you can access the F1 button and a click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It has been described as you can choose different properties for each image, e.g. individuals, places and tags. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog, which is used to already process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a labeling and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section categories, subcategories have already been mentioned. in dialogue options you can set complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group, instead of explained all groups of a member.</seg>
<seg id="956">In view the setup options available to you for fixing the members of the members. with the above listed list, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left window, a list with the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& Kphotoalbum; share its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digitiam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image Plugin Interface. nutritional information can be found on the website of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the menu modules. the modules can and are not described in this manual since they are not part of & cold album; but most modules have an aid page that you can call on the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other, it can be that the modules were tested with & cold album. therefore, you should use new modules first with the demo database before calling them on your own images using the command &gt; Common &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the menu Help. say not, I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules across KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & cold album; do not work. this is the downside if you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & cold album; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications are writing their pictures in albums: this type of order is not supported, simulated for some modules the order after albums, so that you can use the functions with & D album.</seg>
<seg id="962">Here simulates & cold album; the current album, which is simple in view, so all the pictures that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album & D album, I have to commit a list of albums. here's a list of albums, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; browser's browser displays the content of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as a category for virtual albums, so if you use for example the category individuals, will have a Common album; so if you would have chosen persons chosen to view this module and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are compatible with & cold album; not compatible can you remove these from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select in the area modules which modules are to be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">In the picture you can see an example of a start-screen as soon as you boot & cold album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, take a look at the top of an menu toolbar and a toolbar. at the moment, you will not find much information about your pictures. in the section we'll see on this window, but now click on the pictures that shows you an overview with all the existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with notes. these include information about the people who have been recorded on the picture, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures specified by certain notes at the same time. if for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were recorded in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section, be used. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewers.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view three lists with a text box by allowing people to define places and keywords. these are a very important part of & D album; because you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea lies the moving of images within the list: if you have depicted for example a family celebration and displayed on all 50 images the same 5-10 persons, you can make sure that the names of the names are moved up to the top that individuals find and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to list an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting after date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you select any comments on each image individually, you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes. in this case simply click on the buttons and buttons, which are located under the thumbnail preview.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to highlight all these pictures and add the menu item multiple entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you will see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the Comment dialogs is it possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. additionally you can also take an entry in a category to make this subcategory of this entry. caution, this requires you to sort out your categories alphabetically. view this.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the Comment dialogs, by pressing the lease, which form the upper edge of the frame, click and postpone it. you can also make a separate window by setting it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs, you click on the button Options... which gives you the possibility to store the current set up and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also complete a frame completely. if you would like to see this window again later, use the button Options... and then window a / hide. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you choose the entry pictures in the browser, you get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all the pictures in case you have no filter for this. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply configure the mouse button with the middle mouse button, configure it simply.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you get an image on the background of your desktop, this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this picture is displayed in the picture section. if you do not have a window opened with a picture-view, a new display showcase will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the picture preview. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete or select the Delete button or select in the menu Edit menu. now, you can see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kingalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use the images stored anywhere, so you have to use the pictures anywhere, so you can record the images anywhere; in the picture you can see the view from & cold album; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, where the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on your hard disk. for example, the pictures are recorded on the hard disk. however, for the pictures 5-9, however, the thumbnail pictures are present, so that's kphotoalbum; you can view the preview of these images. however, you can't view these pictures with the picture.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see, this function needs that you want to copy files from the folders and again copy. & cold album; if you want to avoid trouble as the mess fringe of your images, please buy a larger hard disk in order to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu images you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to stay a little more privacy, you'll also want to block the images that you want to make for others unaccessible and click on Latest View menu. alternatively, you can also select all the images that can see your little sister and select the menu item all out of current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this, you have specified which images in the case of the case should be hidden. if you block the laptop now of your little sister, simply select the images you have blocked, hidden. if you want to see the pictures again, click Sperre uplift.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which must be inserted to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password in the menu privacy.</seg>
<seg id="992">Remember that this picture protector is not at all very safe. for one, all images on the hard disk and on the other can delete or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection serves only those who are using & kingalbum; not very familiar to repel the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you can describe all your pictures with & cold album; to describe and spend hours of hours with it is natural that you want them to look at some point. for this reason, it has a photocopy; for this reason, it has a picture _ and video viewing. you can preview it from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. it shows of course the image, but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture, such as who is in the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the Infobox on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag these to the mouse and disclaim it. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether any information is displayed. all these options are available according to a right-click on the viewer. the following context menu can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the Infobox are underlined. if you click here on the browser, see, matching entries to this display. if you click on Anne Helene, the browser displays you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them and switch back by using the keys image high and image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these features are also available from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run it as a slideshow. how often it loads a new image after a few seconds. how often there is a new image can be controlled by pressing the Strg button and Plus or minus. and now the diaschau is executed by the keys Ctrl; S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful ability of the spectator of & cold album; it is used in full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can get into the picture and draw out zooming. to the herzoid you can easily pull a rectangle. with the minus button you can restore the Plus button zoomt into the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom-rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the picture is not shown zoomed. with the equation put the Zooms, so that each pixel will be on screen a pixel screen.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomoperations work in videos that start in and out zooming using the plus and MinuOption are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the functions from the context menu, you can rotate the picture. this doesn't work with videos. you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you will find an image of a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can open the drop down and configuration dialog of the picture to give these names. however, you will perhaps prefer to highlight the image and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer, to see the pictures on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you watch one after another.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above you give the viewer the opportunity to show pictures with features while you watch them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the appropriate letters. in view of a picture, where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your pictures, these are available in the browser. you can see all the pictures you edit, print or whatever you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview view. if you choose categories in Dre thumbview, then you can add characteristics to the pictures by pressing the letter for the attribute, after the picture was chosen. you can see here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, it allows you to paint a "cold album" on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The Gemold is not stored with the image but in the database. in the way you can revert your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In the picture you can see a picture on the painted. to switch the painting mode from the context menu. to end the image, you simply put the cross in the toolbar top at the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you have to control the application of the program & Povray; not fully dominate but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object-tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and display the object in the wire modes yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects simultaneously. but not the lower object of an already selected object, since all subobjects have already been selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following set menu is inserted so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar, edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button, you can remove selected objects from the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have altered properties, click on any application to take these changes. if you entered the invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and recallocate the changes with aborting.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; user's guide in the layout dialog, you can view the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user guide to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 contains the user's documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or a part of a texture you can see a preview in the FeaturesFeb view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press the thumbnails' view and a small example of the scene is encorded with the chosen texture, even if you want to choose a subordinated item (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), crosses local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these points with the mouse button and thus change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is chosen, the control points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotating as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling the mouse within the whole window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their visibility is smaller or equal to the toolbar selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window-order as default. the object tree and the view of the property properties are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need any other arrangement, you can adjust them as you like. you can also save multiple windings and easily change between different systems.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under any view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to rearrange multiple views, drag the starter in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views through clicking on the card's card in the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window frames are soaring views: views that are not anchored in the main window. in order to resolve a view from the anchoring, drag the starter on the desktop or click the small to the left edge arrow in the form of fibre.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To view a view, click on the small cross in the fibre-bar. to prevent the closing, click the small square between arrow and cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views in the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are narrow, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be stored with window frames. it will display a dialog in which you can save the window-order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">When you created a scene, you can renching it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to Render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To renching the current scene, click on the icon Renders in the toolbar or select the menu-in view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A Render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it controls the size and quality of the rendering. if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and levels of quality, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the icon The Render settings in toolbar, or in the menu 'View modes... select, the following dialogue will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Every Render mode has a name. you can input any name, but it is a name that lets determine the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the desired image. if you want to run only one small area of the picture, select the crossfield subsection and enter the picture-section to the entry into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination of quality you can choose the properties, the & Povray; for renders used. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuser reflections. a detailed description of the rendering features can be found in the user's manual page & Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If an image is executed with only one beam of pixels, several bugs can arise. these images often have a Moirè-pattern or stool effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed when they are in representation smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of this error. in general, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray. more than a ray depending on pixels. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super sampling. as standard is a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is constantly redivided and adaptive because each pixel is constantly redivided and adaptive because the recursionary ranges from the calculated shades.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray tracks a ray depending on pixels. if you set the difference between the coloring to the neighboring pixels, then both pixels are charged by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with a set of 4x4 additional points, at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixel will be calculated: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold, the pixels will be monitored in 4 sub-pixels that can be tested individually and on further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set by low pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is that the generation of smokers for the ray process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate one scene with that property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card card, you can set whether the Alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is transparent when the associated beams have no property.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray. if & Povray; unexpectedly ends, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene to import, select the menu-on file to import... and choose a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & kpovmodeler now does not support the full instruction of & Povray.. if in imports, error messages or alerts appear, a dialog windows shows a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can also drag objects from the object tree into the editor to import the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code to import into the scene, just select the source code in the editor and drag it in the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">Mit copying and inserting in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor allows you to insert source code for & Povray; also fit.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler: a scene renders. usually, this is Povray or x-Povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the Featurated view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user's documentation for the displayed object. put the path to your document and the version. supports the versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example altimeter) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you want to include files which are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to those files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for viewing the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for viewing the selected checkpoints.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The colour of the rectangle for the view in the camera view and in the window-type labels.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can adjust the object-catch of points to the reaster menu of the wire model. you can set the buttons separately for shifting, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to renders. for some objects like the ball, you can set the detailed stage for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you interrupt the high details of detailed projections, all wire model views are further divided when the camera is using an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections using exceptions of the perspective and the vertical projections. this property gives a better approach to projections, but requires more time to rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you want to see wall, a wall behind the objects is broken down. the wall is displayed in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you want to see soil the floor appears below the object, the ground is displayed in a chess breakwater pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you activate the cantership, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method used for rendering of scenes. the values for depth and swelling can be set. precise information about parameters can be found in the section Render modes.</seg>
<seg id="1071">This page allows you to change existing window frames or create new window frames. in the section window-orders is explained, as you can create and store windows.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Standard window frames: displays all existing window frames. & kpovmodeler; used the chosen window-order at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window frames shows all existing window frames. a new order can be added with the button, and delete a selected order with the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window-order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">"" "the list under the name shows all views on the chosen window order. new views can be created with the button" "" "Add" "" "button and delete selected views with the" "" "Delete" "" "button." ""</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with new column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with unten anchor you get the window below the existing window, with card cards, you get a card hand side, in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just installed & Povray; and now you want to start without precise knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate however easy scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should read the following warnings carefully before you complain that you as a result can only get a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering as a result you receive a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not paste light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have all error-free installed, take a look at the first launch of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-installed window frames:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the toolbar. read the documentation so you can find adequate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. mark the scene and then select the menu entry, so you have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wires model display shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate. in particular, you notice the scene from the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the renderers of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, see the content of the View properties tab, where the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the user's guide to & Povray, please find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything about the basic settings of the camera, but note that the camera can change in view control points, with which you can change the waypoint in view. simply click on a control point and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the button application or the input button, the wire model views and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they look at the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a quader (inserting end body quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but that is a clear method of solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; does indeed offer a simpler possibility. you can use an infinite level as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then push the button application or input button. in the object-tree the new name is instantly displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wiremodel view now shows the plane, although at the moment only as a limited level. if you renders the scene, the plane stretched to horizon up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you watch the object tree, you will find that you can preview the entry for the bottom, if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only see the different parameters for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the bottom to exercise an unit among the horizon line, just so you can get to know some of these parameters. select shifting and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First, select the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but choose something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialogue will open in which you can choose how the object should be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can view the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the button preview, see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigments preview is only a matted black material, because you need to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore, keep in mind that you can check the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview. now give the colors for the pigment. also, there are many options now, but just take the easiest.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the quader and ball, just click on the button users and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the ground is now right. if you are running your picture now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color. you need to enter two new attributes, called unicarbig. then select this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose in object tree any time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should you already be able to carry out, as you should have understood the basic function of & kpovmodeler; already the ball can be set just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of the properties properties you can immediately change the settings. put the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the button applicators) so that the ball might float above the ground as you have moved the ground around a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering yields now a strange result: as previously seen before, the ball surface appears like a matted black material. put in the following step a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to her. as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select first object and change the name for example in the sphere of pigment. click on the sphere of pigment, select a monochrome and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on any application or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings sheen effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what features you & kpovmodeler; and hopefully you have already learnt so much that you can create simple but beautiful sceneries.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytraycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or a model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you are a scene raytractions, the Render hypothetical Rays from the perspective of the spectator (i.e. from the camera that the scenes) reflects through the objects and how atmospheric effects like for example fog have effects. so the scene is processed pixels for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you see the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, any scene that should be hurled, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously made using & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open up a new model, the file will be inserted in this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it is stored under the same name. is it a new file, you need to enter a name and a storage place.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Presents the scene in the last recorded version. all changes since the last store are rejected.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only select if you still do not have stored changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeated the last set-up command. this menu entry can only select if you have used refringently.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialogue where you can enter a name for a new type of arrangement, or write an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and the standard behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add-commands with this option for & kpovmodeler; commands or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove toolset for & kpovmodeler; commands and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to pre-use surface, without having to model any bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometric form of object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is customary to use the same file both for a bump map as well as a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic body are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body. these models are then further processed to give them a realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object on a pixel base, using a image file as a color map.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image considering and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in an own window in the size of the picture or in full-screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can display with clicking on the & LMBO; or the Return / button.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set if every image is to be displayed in a separate window, or if all images always use the same window.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main sections, on the left side is the navigation area. in the navigation area, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context-browser. on the right hand side is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three subwindow: music, text and interpreters. these three subwindows are later used in detail. they provide information on the ongoing play to each of the different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you've already used earlier versions of & AmaroK; perhaps you might be noticed that the subwindow will be dropped off. the information presented here is now collected in other parts of & AmaroK; moreover, the information in the statistical window will be collected (extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The window window shows information about the current piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title, the name of the piece, interpreter and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a musical Brainz symbol. click on this icon to detect the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz icon you will find further information about the current piece. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time, as well as its assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context-browser, the cover images are supported in the same folder as the current piece. file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display cover images that have been downloaded with the cover management or have been embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces on. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>

<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the interpreter, lists all the albums of the current interpreter that you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be up and you see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual fields to immediately start playing. you can also click with the right mouse button to click on it and then select from the context menu one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text window text, the downloaded lyrics for the current piece is displayed. this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download the text editor from other websites. once you click on the text subwindow, please read the text for the piece on the Internet. if there is no text script running, you can choose which should be started.</seg>

<seg id="1358">Grouping interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly beneath the interpreter. albums or genres are being ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping interpret / Album - First will be arranged the pieces by interpret and below will be a further distribution according to the new album. if you want to see interaction or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are shown at the start of the list under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping performer / year - Album - Sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - Albumname is used.</seg>

<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust the grouping entirely to exposure and combine.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & AmaroK; will automatically capture your collection once you change something at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">Directly under the toolbar you find a search filter. it behaves right in the list view as well as in the modular view. information about using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection field, with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. besides, you can of course choose your overall collection, which makes the filter convenient.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking on an entry in the collection browser you will receive the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Download - This leert the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>

<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. these use & AmaroK; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>

<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar you find a search area where you can search for a file. search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden, which do not correspond to your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the browser-browser you can get a address bar, with which you can get music from an absorbed url. if you press for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz to access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it down.</seg>
<seg id="1387">When the playlist is longer than in the window square, the hanging of files can be helpful by simply folding. in the case, the holding of the Shift key can be helpful: this will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the corner of the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries, the spaces are included, then attach the search term with griffon feet: Mike Oldfield. this makes for entries sought by Mike Oldfield, but not for applications such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a certain search engine, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: review: &gt; 50th This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece which does not contain a particular search term, make a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations for exposing with one another. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the playability of entries by pressing the Strg button, and then clicking with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then get a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reprinted.</seg>

<seg id="1464">Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described above the What is this? -help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data-CD / DVD or Video DVD project. this is useful when you import files from a previous session to the current project. this is useful when you are not used files for a multi-session CD. it's more useful for you to be used as help, so that you can see the files already existing on the medium already existing files and folders.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data-CD / DVD or Video DVD project. this function causes & K3b; imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove files from the medium; it only ends the previous imported files again.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Opens the CD-copying dialogue. this also allows you to create a CD on a different medium. alternatively, you can also only create a screen from a CD which you then later want to burn. besides, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copier. you should also choose cloning if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Opens the DVD copying dialog. this allows you to create only one image of a DVD to another medium. alternatively, you can also use only one image of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue. furthermore, the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & K3b;. here, general programs can be made. almost all functions of & K3b; should work on Anhieb. this dialog is intended to personalize and to arrange the exclusiveness of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& K3b; is, like many other & kies; applications also, equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP 18 functions, you can either use the command line dcop, or use the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the functionary distance, so it is rather your taste and the kind of your formulation is crucial to what the included programs you give in.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we take that you use the command line dcop. to use the & DCOP, you need to make sure that & K3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; features that have all & kde; -program in common, supports & K3b; primarily two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & K3b; provides functions like copyCD, format DVD and other features for generating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef Cream CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () DCOPRef createMovixCDProject () ACOPRef create.DVDvd () void copyDvd () void) Dvd () void burnCdimage (Kururl) void burnDvdImage (Kururl)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method one gets a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (K3b, K3b / audiocd) and then reference to the project obtained via # dcop K3b K3b K3b Interface currentProject Durch Use this reference is it possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b provides the K3bProjectInterface as well as the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be applied to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void addaddUrl (Qstring, Qstring Parent) void removeItem (Qstring path) void removeItem (Qstring path, Qstring newname) void setVolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folder and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop K3b K3b) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT _ cop / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; -leser for & kde;. with him can easily be stored audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the one installed on the machine.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for use of & CD; data in WAV files on the hard drive) and by many encoders (loss-free compression). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (loss-free compression) are required (loss-free compression). other encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per title) compressed to the MP3- or OGG format or other formats such as the loss-free FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggaubis (for OGG) or other Kodifier. all these programs are usually not necessarily required for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile something itself. however, if FLAC is not used, the installation is also not required.</seg>

<seg id="1502">While the installation has to be made only once (the installation dialog, however, can be called so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily usage for the reading of a & CD. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you often stumble at the beginning.</seg>

<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (like protocols, Piepsen) for program events (like reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main initial dialog of & audiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoders). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, coding and compression rates and helps you to choose the right cooking.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a loss of free audio format is needed. besides FLAC there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the cons are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can give these files back.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats, the information generated by data compiling according to their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bitrate the differences will be less important since both codifier produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless provided with most distributions free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high-quality sound quality (with high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with deeper bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or a computer-based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG devices are available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices like standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereotypes. today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for other parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium' = This setting gives good visibility for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = this setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme' = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and some less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11th 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music by young people, portable devices and car stereosofacilities. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane' = 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or transmitted by the program automatically from the freeDB are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the code name for the folder and file name as well as the characteristics of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with Kodistro programs, there is often a combination of programs for the codians and the parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodiers declare the switches for these programmes.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example around the & CD; add titles to the keywords (English: day) when MP3s are coded by lame and the title parameters of & audiocreator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can download the audio CDs, allowing all other information to download and enter into the computer instead of it: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (Antrim of the author: that is the author meant) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there's more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be attached. all information can be obtained in case of a bumblebee through a & CD; business, physically or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & audiocreator; Aktiv actively to select an address (Send a address). for the use of freeDB can not be used with another (counterfeit) address when retrieving the data from server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">In many countries there are copies of the main database. if & audiocreator; used for the use of freeDB, geographically is used on the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a list of Spiegelservers for online call from & CD; information available during the reading of a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded, or (usually done monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which lesbian program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. it has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. it has to be noted that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To store the full WAV files the codifier and thus the desired file format can be chosen. at the first opening, there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression for audio data) on the tab to insertion the code. other coaster can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The codifier package must be installed by the respective linux distribution before the Kodiver can be used. further information about Kodiver can be found in Chapter One Kodifier.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing another code, you can get more information about your switches through the input of a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolder window (eg. sole). it must 'lame' be replaced by the name of the installed body.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the furnishings of the device designation of the & CD; / DVD drives, the spelling and readsheets of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed. try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what's wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the envelope of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, these tips can give you how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have read the complete manual, everything is understood, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-for-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will launch the program for the first time, all set up and our first & CD; read lame '--preset extreme' to use MP3s using a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps for average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be used as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame may be found for example with a search engine, since it is considered not completely free software. at least it is not necessary to compile source files, which you can do of course always.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have screaming access to it (eg. by trying to copy a bit).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & audiocreator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what to be repeated for each triggering & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we decide to use the compression of code for compression of music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to use the & CD; download data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change it in any release of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the lesbian program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces can read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, the / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, a view to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card supports General settings. here you can not do much. here, an additional transformation can be defined. in our example everything is shown as bellow / input as in the screenshot is shown.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in full information can be selected, so that you will be informed if details concerning the detection of keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freeDB computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer has to be connected while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet so that it can access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, is a & CD; entry found starts immediately the reading of the & CD; which is later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / filename - &gt; rename the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Aside from this example, if you want to manually input everything manually, so disable the selection fields and freeDB will not use it twice. however, these over 620 MB large, consider this twice to be worthwhile. to use freeDB in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server over the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD is to be received? read the section on freeDB. put it all as it is in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB Server: please go to the website freedb.org and look for a mirror server in your area. on this way the load is distributed between the machines. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as for the server, but there are many firewalls to boot the protocol 8880 default vinegar, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to transmit any & CD; data to the freeDB server transmit. the first interstical field should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number simultaneously beginner pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time only one existing drive? parallel reading and code? the author doesn't know it, therefore just try his own.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; for the reading of the last piece: cross this to the & CD; at the end of the trial expires.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you want to cross this, then the WAV files can be specified in which the WAV files are stored. if the box is not included, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget that folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Everything to enter as it is in the screenshot: the command is a bit long, under circumstances a little bit has to be made to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hifi stereo equipment. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for the limitation of generating tags at version V1 / V1.1.ID3v2 'tags can be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent' id3 'tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Put the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of used metapAV files at the same time: with a Dualcore or Quadcore or even a multi-processor machine can be tried to convert more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & audiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for any release of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section is described, as the process of reading the & CD; to disk the hard drive. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music on the hard disk is structured, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freeDB will be described, must be repeated for each application & CD; to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freeDB, the screenshot shows a little different from the data cleared for a & CD; therefore you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of storing them from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Try not to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, now the & CD; into the drive, which was defined in the main window, will be dragged.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only happens when the & CD; as an audio CD, could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers for the help or go back to the previous section concerning basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully completed by the freeDB, all the songs of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; the key for your & CD; there will be a window bundled and you can select the database entry in your opinion best to your & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not have the crossfield for the automatic query of freeDB (on the page & CD; settings in dialogue for settings), you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but you may need the access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD-editor - entry of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece on the first line of the input field 'Upeller title', the rest of the data in the input field 'album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered into the input field 'updating title' unless you have compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments inidiff per piece, the comment box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after successful withdrawal of data from the freeDB the CD Editor is not empty, but it has always been a good idea to verify the content of the CD editor, so that you may not only start with the artist's and album names (e.g. if all words are happy with uppercase letters or not...) but also to check if there are any undesirable remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1-tags. this is limited the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, Album and title of a piece and on only 28 signs for the commentary area. if you set up ID3v2 tags, you have set up unlimited field-length, at least for what & audiocreator; maximum allowed. this option will be set up on the Codierset settings; take a look at the 'basic settings' tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by any coerors or file formats. see in the help of the Kodifier to get more information.</seg>

<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, Awe, FM and CIS cards (for the latter you need the LUP drivers and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog, with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from one & Konqueror; window into the & mimid; this will also work with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and begged the button Abplay in the toolbar, select the entry to play from the menu or numbed the vacancy.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & mimid; a piece automatically starts once you pull it on the & mid; window pull it. (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then merged each other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; a piece of play, you can jump in any position by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is too fast or too slow to play, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template. to get back the original speed, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space-button has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space break, like a pressure on the button break or the selection of the menu entry in the menu, interrupts the playback. pressing the vacancy while no play is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored on two types in a music piece. some pieces use textures, others use lyrics, and other both. some pieces do not have a text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & mimid, you can set which events are to be displayed, and even better: the Eignisttype is automatically determined that you need to manually set the drop-in text. if you want to change anything manually in the menu settings, you have still the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an Eignisttype, select from the menu settings the entries Dedication or song events. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files which you summarize. this will be played by a number of MIDI files. in this section, you can use the collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, you first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the point Organize.... Click there on New and give the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy a existing collection by clicking on Copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can define the desired ones you want.</seg>
<seg id="1638">In the temporary collection, all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not stored. take care of when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song using the button Add a song. it appears in turn the file dialog, with whose help you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition to the collection is activated, a piece will automatically be added to the active collection by opening (using file opening or drag & drop) automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1643">When Automatically add to the collection not enabled, at the opening of a piece the temporary collection is activated and performed. this collection will then continue to be added pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click away.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the row after the submenu, the menus are played in sequence, as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add songs or remove random order in the menu, the order will be re-established.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list about the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the button next song, the entry next song from the menu, or press the button arrow right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To switch back a song back, select the button previous piece, the entry previous piece from the menu, or press the button arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click the button Delete.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection can not be deleted. however, this does not matter, since they are not stored when leaving & kmid; not saved.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case the MIDI-MIDI-MIDI events translate into events that synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map, converts all events of type Change Herto Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and can sound the trumpet as originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all Soundcards GM are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and CIS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-Maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file, which stores all necessary requirements for the playing of a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. but for this, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap..." END Define KEYMAP "A further keymap... END Options... END Options...</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for Options) and END that the end of a paragraph is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are non-MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, the patches of General MIDI will be depicted on your specific keyboard. the general usage looks as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equality character is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is needed to set the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by a gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with Ton 60), which is similar to a gun powder. in addition, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (gun), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, no matter which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drummer patch of the patch is meant, with which every sound is a different percussioner instrument (drums, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone signifies the tone-height of the ever same drum (like him possess some keyboards).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to specify how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section the order of lines is very important, as well as its presence. so you must create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used primarily to cover sounds on the perimeter channel. take a look at the keymaps provided as an example.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to swap the first and second channel, you simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion to a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based upon the following patterns:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is shown on the channel N. if you use keymap option, the Keymap will naturally use the name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch is always used patch x.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the Perkine patch on the perimeter channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates which ratio Pitch-Bender-Event shall be multiplied with the value, this is credited with the formula * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used to make no decimal measure.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM gives that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-bender event with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to an octave. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find it in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole range of pions (one for each MIDI channel). on this Claviaturen you see which tones are just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a certain channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can choose an instrument, the button shines no more green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The sealview has (up to now) two different views, to view the played notes. in the menu, select Settings menu under the dot channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The pace-LCD shows the speed with which a song will play. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So you can change the pace of a song. so if you find for example, a song is too fast, to follow the text, you can slowdown it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information on how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc.. thus, the same MIDI file on two different devices can lead to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in a very different way.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can force anybody to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs approximately 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change a similar sound quality. at a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, Deb) by & kmid; which happens because & kmid; without Awe-support was compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download a source code and install (for example by kmid; 'Home)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add an entire folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Do not agree, support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & Konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & mid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Simply enable the adjustment of automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can insert the arrow-button on the left of the Tempo- LCD bed to slow down the reproduction. click on the default speed click on the LCD double-double.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have been playing on a & D; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file-file) or if I want to play a file, merely in the & Konqueror; window change and drag the desired file into the window of & mimid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's suppose you have the MIDI files Amid, B.mid and C.-d. first you just want to play the first file. so make the setting of automatic Add to the collection and open A.IE your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then do you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people have sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, animate me so on & to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I am in the third year, so I don't have much time to take time for my hobbies, but I try to take a little time. as Hobbies I have programming, MIDI files collect, make music and prove propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files if you want to make a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arraver.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really make a great pleasure for me to send me a postcard from your location or a MIDI- / karaoke file by a local group, I will send me a postcard or a MIDI file. before you want to send me a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and I would like to get out of it for money. I therefore want to stress that I'm just about getting feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - rectifying the error, that the pitch was too high at Awe cards.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for the test of the CIS support, Ignacio Garcia, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Urko Lusa, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, notified or even only a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net that give us this wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid, can be found on his homepage, which can be found at http: / / www.arradon.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can trace the development, look and look at pictures. you can also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same if you use a FM-device or an Awe card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you could have a sound card, except that you can of course listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If any problems occur, please contact one of the & ccus; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& kmplayer; is a simple interface for Mplayer, phono and FFMpeg. the program is used for playing video files that supported by MPlayer or Phonon formats, as well as playing DVD, VCD's or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help, please send the KDE website to new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there are always windows with the playlist. and finally there is a window window, which will be displayed only if information is displayed in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries, which are played after each other, so you should use the category of permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy. if you click an entry, his group and all its sub-groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do it if & kmplayer /, can be changed by an editor, but also by using the application. simply click on a name of a category Cutter that appears from the menu view and next processing mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this section is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to choose from the menu of the same with playlist, and either selected the editing mode, or selected another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode leave or another group will be selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & kmplayer; some features can be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change from [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can simply be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & kmplayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / p / kmplayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / p / kmplayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during the start doesn't need to be short, it is automatically ended by opening another source. this would however disturbing the end-animation, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation may be the ads of a favorite photos: & lt; IMG Dur = "inise" src = "file" / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet; & lt; / smilts; in the directory tests / some examples of SMIL will be supported by & kmplayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a rider for the configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. here, the path can be set from the Met and the intermediate storage size from the disk and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'console' in the toolbar of kmplayer. here's the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no rider for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & kmplayer;. everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. here is an example like a 'flash' with the module swfdec-mozilla is played:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash' can be played inside & kmplayer; it can even be played the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">So that the & kmplayer; 'flash' in HTML pages can reproduce, the & kmplayer; module as service provider for the MIME type 1 / x-Shockwave-flash in the furnishings dialog file access of KDE are specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Conqueror or & kmplayer; is displayed in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser library library. the gestated process is crisp. if there is no error, the backend issue is inside & kmplayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to consider).</seg>
<seg id="1726">Thus getting a pre-determined backend for a particular mime-type is taken (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon is to reproduce all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& kmplayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be looked like, the scanner can be configured from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video data Rekorder) settings in the kmplayer, the dialog is used in the Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port to use. there, ports should be selected, one of which is selected for use (for example, it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a DVB included in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of kmplayer can only use XVideo (probably this type of playback of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoprolinux extension must be functional for the X server. for the XFree86 server therefore must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config).</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally are used by KMPlayer for the sources different names. at the time of the creation of this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvsource, pipesource, tvsource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if they are activated, they begin with the playback of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints as I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from him (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -e 8 / dev / CDROM is to run as user root after installing the device. it is absolutely certain to make sure that / dev / CDROM indicates the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does each time my CPU has to be tested on their performance?</seg>

<seg id="1753">The quick-level assistant of & kile; is a complete function for the rapid creation of a document in & kile;. selecting the document (menu) provides some ways to create the document. it can also be made some to the document related settings.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Documentation: this is hereby the type of document printed document: article (article), book [text], report [report], report (DIN) [Sartcl], Report (DIN) [official], projector [beamer], films [beamer] or customized.</seg>

<seg id="1759">& kile; offers - just like other source code editors - the incessation of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). thanks to & kile; a simple problem-looking text is not closed. however, it is likely to be noticed by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will be saving you by passing time and the heat.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic disintegration of the environments is created by entering a new command (e.g.\\ 'command}) from & kile; automatically a blank line (to input the text) and the associated line to the locker room (e.g.\\' command}). this function can be disabled in the menu. set up... LaTeX commands are disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually divided into some elements. & latex; thus, the subdivision of the document in the following elements (part is the most common and subtle element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in structuring, the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click on the respective device.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating one's own & latex; files can be very helpful over the file. as soon as a DVI; file [recorded file (engl. D e V ice I nay File)], jump & kile; through a click with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer on the appropriate line in the & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contained a description of the format document and also other information like the font and is adjacent to PDF the hereditary output of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, conversion and printing of DVI; files for different systems and operators.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the rates, the elements of the DVI; file with the editor is shortened and as soon as an element in the DVI; file is clicked, becomes the exact opposite of it. once upon a section in the & latex; source code was shortened, becomes the appropriate place in the DVI;</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master-Document: this function is used in working with multiple files. with a master document the work with other included .tex files will be simplified. when using a project a project-wide master-document can be set up project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File Gender: in this mode, the DVI; file is used on the current nderogâ, in the case, and it does not take a call by & eyepiece; after the screening.</seg>
<seg id="1769">In case of viewing the toolbar, the three positions should be stripped. the selection fields have been developed for the fast influx of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for the rapid linkage of the document in parts, chapters, sections,... The veritable & latex; commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Further forms part of articles such as tags, fox, notes or references. the items are available:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a term is created for a section, an image or other element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for the reference to a fixed name (selection above a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quotation, a selection list is displayed with literary ones. for the editing of & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the author can also be written in & kile by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-field with the name granny will be used for defining the font, for the main text, the Fuels notes, etc. there are the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, there are two choices: 1. the assistant to create a new document by selecting the document type and determining settings. 2. The document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets according to the\\ 's command include the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has to be entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do is the usage of the construction or the button of Quick bau.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored in front of the compile. & kile; the storage is automatically saved.</seg>
<seg id="1779">Display the compile of the document, should be searched in the protocol for the errors. when using quick-speed, & eyepiece should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the protocol should also be observed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (English. environment) is a text that is different from the remainder of the document. for example, a report with the font should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ HUGE and\\ into {environment}.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are used only within the environment (from\\ to {environment} to\\ '{environment}).</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many ways to get the readability of the readability and user-friendliness of the document. it allows for example certain types of fonts, flavorings, blood pressure, submissions, etc., these commands finish either with the\\\ 'command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the course of course and is long as long as it is closed until it is closed with a\\ '{receptive} or another environment. a single word in one set can be recursively shown with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {rate} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Once the background is presented to the letter of the source text with the & latex; recording language, a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once upon the assistant a bit of text was entered, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be accomplished. therefor, there should be a quotation, a few places in the fat and spa pressure, and a poem to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document is viewed, it can be returned to the Editor via Editor-View or CtrE (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, its windows must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed or converted into a & PostScript file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is a small-day file format (engl. D e V ice I nay). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printer, & PostScript. / PDF converters or computer screen monitors.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - it can be printed in print (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion can begin into the toolbar using the buttons in toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">Look for the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -binary files. there must be only modern under settings Kile set up... tools building.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To search for the preliminary search, the mouse-cursor must be positioned at one line of the source code, and must be attached to the corresponding position in the DVI; the viewer takes place at the appropriate place in the DVI;</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; closed and kile; in & ocular; as text editor set (settings ocular up... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">Should in the use of fast-speed of the & DVI; the viewer will not be a mistake. if a bug is available, this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file will be the error source in the source code. in the editor you can see the knowhistle error messages and NÃ ¶ ff LaTeX errors to view the error message. to view the error message, must be clicked to the error in the log file and kile; jump to the error on the error.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once a window is clicked in the toolbar, a window appears to choose from the template for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Selecting an empty document can either be written either from scratch or use the assistant to quickly create a new document. more information can be included in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Overall users of & latex; usually use the same introduction to nearly all documents. assists can be done in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either create an existing & tex; - / latex; file size or a new file will be created. & kile; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of document templates.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a new document, some strings by other data will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or string code). these variables can set up in settings Kile... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating a template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings from which variables are replaced:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it will be used as follows:\\ 's class [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the Assistants and the related commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps have been accomplished:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, its own template, instead of the standard, can be washed out.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any of any latex; files will be created. if a simple way to create a template, you should search for one on the Internet and the steps described under the steps described above.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & Kate; as internal editor. & Kate; is a text editor of many different kinds of text files (including also & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & Kate; can be done in the menu, directly out & kile;</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more & Kate; and his ways of experience should experience the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter of work with the editor of & Kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; offers a very practical & latex; command preference, which can be viewed via the menu help LaTeX reference. you can find a detailed description of nearly all the commands that can be found in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">A double-click with drunken Strg button to dump the & tex; that means that in this way the click on\\ par of\\ o\ 's merely\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When pulling the text with proper linker mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow-edge with penetrated Shift key, parts of the source code can be ejected in the editing window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the opportunity to browse different types of source texts and emphasize this. for example, the lolatex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulae are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants may arise from our bookmarks. this is about one's own way of bookmarks within the text. the menu is highlighted the jump to the most difficult or last springmark. thereby, this jumping mark is highlighted, so that it will automatically convert the jump at the initial input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Working is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & kile;. although & Kate; already excellent facilities for writing a & latex; source text added; special orders for their selection. under conversion, the following commands contain text code:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Wns a complete paragraph (group of lines included on both sides a blank line). with a paragraph there is not a text with transparent lines (like in other text ditors). these advanced meanings coincides with the tables, latex; commands and all other lines of source code. thus, the only bent thing in & kile; is therefore that the question separated by two blank lines are separated.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word under the current Curtains position. this selection also has an advanced meaning since this command also latex; commands with an unfinished star (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To present a part of this document may naturally be removed, and by wiring the key can be removed. & Kate; offers the keyword Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & kile; offers the following commands to convert the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to work-in paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been interpreted to play a central role in & latex; therefore, & kile; for more commands under Bework environment for an easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command will jump in the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right in front of the command to the main attraction of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the command to the locker and the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, is injected to the end of the area (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many flowered, commands, the command can quickly be lost. this command stop the last surrounding, so that the wastewater structure will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups, which are determined by brackets {...}. under Bework TeX group are some important commands, those of the working environment correspond.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command is injected to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the sounding clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is injected to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed right behind the beaten gorge.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the weighed bond of a & tex; group #, is injected to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">In the input of many swallowed groups-clasps, one can quickly drop the eye view. this command slept in the last group, so that the spelled structure of the & tex; -groups will not be dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; are used two easy annexation signs at & kile; the sign "for two easy annexation signs is used. also for the purpose of the application, the sign" is used. & kile; already knows this case and for two interlocking points suitable for & latex; a.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic exterior of double piercing marks can set up under settings Kile... LaTeX and exterminated.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Many other languages can also be used (e.g. ngerman or French) and therefore German or French. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">For the wiring of Shift; input button, & kile; an intelligent pointer. if the current position is placed within a lists (such as enumerate or itemize), for example the current position within a lists environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize).</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a tables environment, t & kile; the current line with\\\\\ with an remaining pointer.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support prescrib & latex; - or user-defined environments to support them.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users like to arrange the columns in tables environments and all Et signs (amp;) to each other. & kile; sought and kile; after the most beautiful tabulator in the next line. even though this tulator is not the associated; some intermediate space for the Columns position of the current table.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & Kate; already offers a good source code effect, it was installed in & kile; for special orders (mostly for & latex;) still extended. there are three different modes available for automatic composing. all these modes can be set up for different modes of working under settings Kile... discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\, {surroundings} becomes & kile; automatically added to the\\ 'environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">With the wiring button, the last character of the input will be removed and may be gripped the complete list. on the other hand, the list by entering another letter can also be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a brief description of their parameter. alternatively, descriptions are oftenly written by selecting a command. alternatively, you can also start jumping into these positions by means of the springle jump brand and the desired parameters can be shipped.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Among settings kile; set... kile; complete settings can be made for these lists. it may be different kinds of options for & tex; - and & latex; commands as well as whales of the general language used to use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is for the execution of environments not nish. there are always a few letters with\\ 'to be entered and the call of the installation process will have a large list with ambient temperatures. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for completing the submissions of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the installation process, the entire management system or the key-key Alt + Shift key-button is automatically defied the command to the end of the environment and it appears\\. after that, the environment has continued on the easiest way and can be completed by urging the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this has been accomplished, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile, detects that it is a list of environment, even a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under settings kile; set... kile; complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the full list of version mode for & tex; - und & latex; -commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supporting user-defined lists of towing, which can be replaced immediately by number Kile strings. as an example of a bizoning list, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the entry L =\\ LaTeX file is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word complementary mode: the menu is introduced, the code was introduced, the letter A L is replaced with the string\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Big whÃ ¶ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ Ã ¼ nden are not helpful. however, that many whales in a document can be written more than once. thus it offers & kile; complete cancellation for all already written documents.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can set up in the menu Kile... Kile Vercomplete. here you can also specify the swelling for the display of completion.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The authorized files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / p / kile / complete / mode / the PersÃ ¶ nlichen Home-folder. mode is for the application (abortion), Dictionary (Wearrterbook) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The dialogue graphics are designed to create graphics as easy as possible. to monitor the bases on the Graphics, the sections should be observed and observed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for the implementation and rearrangement of pages. if the PDF output is published, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript file; it will be converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to watch the results of work, the source code must be compiled. all components are grouped in the menu creation, creating conversion and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For the compiling of the source code for viewers such as & eyepiece; or the further transformation can be used by pressing forces; 2, by means of Alt; 4 the DVI; file is converted into a PS file and by Alt; 5 the PS file are considered.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the command-speed, normally a viewer is called after the compile-lift. should not be used by a connected viewer, each one gets a new window each time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be presented to the project on the project. here, the following information is asked for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">In the case of the file name window, the relative path must be specified from the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows the instructor to be managed by ECMAScript -Kode. the scripts can be managed in the slot list.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of & kile; even more.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First of all, it must be said that the application environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) has the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite large system, in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of extra packages. & kile; offers a lot of different help to support the operator.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & Texlive; are delivered with many documents. in this includes a documentation for the included packages and another latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">A complete refernz for & tex; and its eâ, "Freundeâ" indicates, it is a complete manual for the & latex; commands contain and thus is ideal for the search for a particular formatting. as this is a very large document, it will be divided into & kile; divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Because of the amount of documents with which & tetex; / texlive; delivered, the final document is not always easy. as a possible help, & tetex; / texlive; the small application texdoctk that contains a database with all to & kile; delivered documents and available for a graphic torso.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package name or impact. from & kile, only the results are displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and e-mail entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for clear identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders as well as subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can look out from the list of members of the team who he is. this happens by searching the team member from the list and press the button. the currently selected member (its identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nickname and setup of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information regarding comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">Apart from an overview of their team, there is another advantage by recording the members of the team: it can be an event for information on the team managers when something is happening. see in more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project happens. an example would be drawing up of the apertures and lockup of the project, so that later someone is working on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script to add a file to CVS as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the page event configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialogs can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee of selected addressee. the addressee may be a team- or subproject leader. see in, wei will be established such leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in documents. they differ from normal comments by following items:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Input notes is simple. it can either selected the note file from the editor-context menu or the @ botation keyword in a commentary box followed by Comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Comments can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), whereby the nickname of the nickname of team member states should be played by the relevant Dix- or Subproject names, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nickname and roll names are independent of large or small size, but spaces around the brackets and the: make the comment invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1953">Not optional tags automatically include: as above all other tags using the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Start and finish-tag automatically update: if enabled, the corresponding subsequent day will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic detection of accent signs: controls the automatic conversion of accentuated characters in corresponding encoding during inserting.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Mime types: Mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. using the button standard, the standard programs can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard drawing: the coding of newly created or in other ways than using file opening files (where the coding of the file can be passed). however, this setting will be released from the same in the project states if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD was not recognized. but this setting will be released from the same in the project states if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies, so that with a power outage or crash at the next launch of the program the document can be restored by this backup. it's not the same as saving the file. even for any stored documents a backup is generated regularly, according to the time issued.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editon area or one's view (or the documentation in a cardboard box), which makes it possible to see the documentation, previews and the source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Set the window settings to the standard back next to the next start is useful when the user interface has arrived by changing the MDI modes and andocks / depend on views through each other. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command parameters.</seg>

<seg id="1963">The place to change the behaviour of & VPL; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronisation behavior of the VPLE and the source code view in the shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structural tree, which represents the figure of the Parser knots in the document, are set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the area of mouse click on the structural tree causes the following action, it is possible to change the action by clicking on the structural tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structural tree-settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree can be automatically opened in the tree, the actualisation of the tree in the tree and how deep during a change of structural tree should be automatically opened. empty knots are the empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are such, where in the current document there is no element found.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The area for completion of abbreviations (a type of templates) which can be valid for working on extensive text. abbreviations are available in groups, each one can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifend bottling is different than in one group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are part-applications from third page, which can be reused by any part-able application, the most known & Konqueror;. in case of a plug-ins, the following shall be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is handed over to the plugin when starting, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Component in "read-read" mode: check whether the plug-in is denied the shop. only-Lese-KParts, usually refuse the shop when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: is this activated, then testet & quantaplus; whether the plug-in information is correct, then, when the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, the debugger was completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been adjusted, as well as the support for the dbg debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented, which allows different implementations over plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only a plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plug in the project settings. using the button options next to the debugger plug-in, the specific settings may be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger activates for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the contents of surveillance variables is displayed. usually appears in the left-left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all the holding points, with drawing numbers and conditions are listed. normally, normally in the lower gudock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. normally in the lower gudock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger, if required, or it shares the plug-in with, to laureate requests. this action is triggered by default, when a project is used, which does not need to be respected in the normal case.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart at debugging session Starte the session. close the link to the debugger or terminates the lull after requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document. the output of this request is shown in the debugger display.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script to start and information on the monitoring variables as well as the currently performed line continuously. if this happens, the execution will continue. happens before a debit claim has been started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Indicates the debugger, with the execution of the script to start using without information on surveillance variables and the current line number. if this happens, the execution runs on. happens, before a debit claim has been given, the execution starts when a request is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger leads the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or includes.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger leads the next instruction in the script, whereby it is possible to error in functions and includes error.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Indicates the debugger, the directive to move and to the next so as if there wouldn't be the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog, in which a variable or an expression can be entered, that is to be monitored. the awoke value appears in the variable view.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be edited by DTD. thus, the descriptionrc; for a re-descriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries to be created:</seg>

<seg id="2026">An action can set up with settings actions... created. click new action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action is weighted keyplate. with clicking the button user interface, a key-abbreviation can be assigned; with Kone the current button-abbreviation can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. it can be entered into a detailed settings in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document on the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. by using this action you can start external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) to change the document or to use as input (or parts of the document). examples from & quantaplus; even the Schnellstart-Dialogue or the different See in... campaigns for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter should be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myscripts. sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scripting you variable in the command line: $KDEDIR / share / p / quanta / badge in their path: $PATH / scripts / scripts in their path: $PATH It provides other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file, file is removed from the document name.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text is added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above can be a script input from & quantaplus; at the default input may be determined, what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the document selected will be sent to the script. the% input is usually required only with this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input can also be redirected to the output of the specified application. there are two types of issue: normal edition, written to the default output; error messages, to which the default output is to be done, by default the drop-down output is set:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the Markup language, it is recommended to share the tags in logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar named the name of the markups.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you must add and configure actions. select settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are rather self-explanatory. press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the day attributes has and you plan their use, enable dialogue to call "Edit" when available, so that an input will be possible when the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this a ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? we replace it before we have difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2044">For creating a symbol that the action is better represented, we will use & kiconedit. select from the & KMenu;, graphics other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; used standard 32x32 pixels, we need 22x22. to change this, select Bework size next.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day start, I decided to create a startup knob as a symbol. by using green (green, mostly interpreted as los, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled a message to the user that Any this symbol is a & lt; start to insert this symbol in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. besides the text field, one button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Keep the user button and continue using any other tags, so there is still, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to complement some standard & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be set to a better overview of several separating into several groups. make sure to set the toolbar set to toolbar. make sure that the toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to choose the separator (very left up) for my toolbar. after selecting the element, the toolbar is to be added, press the arrow-button to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the queror preview. I will select it and add toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please be aware of how the separation can support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar, could believe that the & Conqueror; button the opposite of the start-button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "the new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the correct folder. after reeXML does not exist, it will be used in the correct folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please match its toolbar (s) when a file is opened by the relevant type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for scripting language or the formatting language you like. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; document tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; repository Check if anyone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you have to create the docrc file. the first part is up to you, the second we treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] reply = path, relative to this file, to the documentations HTML files e.g. php42 / # items in the main index file = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Section2 = Sec2.2.html Section2 = = Sec2.2.html &gt; Sec2.2.html &gt; Sec2.2.html (1 = = .1 html, 2 = = .1 html tag 1 = tag 2.html, day = tag2.html, day 3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree. for example, you can now see in PHP & PHP, such as something:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc You = php42 / # top level element Top item = index.html Getting Started = Introduction = Rection.html... Language Reference = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-synax.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in a tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the checkers (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You can notice that the content directory is referenced directly to a file (and in consequence on the top end of the Baumantra & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything but make sure to & b & b; character. these should be replaced by & amp; and & b; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The stage section is the area of the docrc file which is to be displayed for the design of the context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context menu (ContextList) and the file connection.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of by subtly separate context elements that are to be available (for & PHP, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your file docrc simply save to $HOME / .kde / doc / InterBase / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR / doc or $KDEDIR</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to use & quantaplus; -Repository for the use by the & quantaplus; -Community. you will not be wealthy but proud to have worked on the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the waste resources (DTEP packages, tool with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent via email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email menu item, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail send, toolbar, and folders in templates and scripts in the scripts.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus; users can download it. the contributions are checked and only made available to publish a user, where there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is ensured, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked about their Passphrase for their private GPG keys (the Passphrase is not stored), or in the case that you have multiple keys you can choose one. in dialogue New resource you have to stay out the input fields (URL preview can be empty) and with clicking OK the high-load will be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The high-load can be loaded from the menus DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar top-load, and in the context menu of files and folders in the Templar and scripts that can be started.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, nor before the installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource is warning through testing the integrity and signature. in case of problems, it can be discontinued. if the integrity given and the resource correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the originator of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages that is currently not created by & quantaplus; it will be time to work by adding a DTEP package. it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files in days XML format could be necessary. there is the easiest way to convert a DTD automatically to a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD store and conversions a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description which is to be used. then, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target lists: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / p / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! DOCTYPE definitions: the string that appear in! DOCTYPE tag, like HTML Public / / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / html4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine setting of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, brings & quantaplus; after transforming the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are a few key concepts. to be able to understand these and get full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first introduce these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus; little benefit.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction affects a number of components in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are reserved for everyone, the & quantaplus; uses, available. it enables the group of administrators to secure different tool, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development agents for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and tool-tool. local items are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-based elements are available only within a particular project. this can be everything from a certain project. simply, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the Editors window, the building views, the lodges and the tooling. please suggest you in, and for further information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the card-mouse with the right mouse button to get a text-click menu with the current document illustrated contracts, such as closing the current, other or all cartels, recharging, delete or uploading of the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editorf lead to a further context menu regarding the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste / paste) to edit the file under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, if the string is referred to under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the Editorf you find the toolbar of the Editors. currently, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional als standard to provide for which a set of toolbar is shown. in the course of the further construction of & quantaplus, the tool-tools are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar is really easy. if they want to insert a simple tag, then click on the icon that represents the day. now, you can insert the data for this just finished tag. if you want to insert a tag, which has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction prospects (QIT;) allow to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, to open and pass through. in the presentation with Karting lodges are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation components.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool, the & quantaplus; preparations. this view displays all the files in the project and allows the administration of the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, removal, uploading or deletion of files from storage media can be performed with the displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another option of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. nearly everything can be a template: images, program parts, a whole website & etc. it will be open to you all possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Assists can be divided into three categories, depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding users and assists in projects are available only in the project. more to templates is found in.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project will also work here. by clicking on the right mouse button, you can retrieve the available information to a script, as for example the script to start, process or send an email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, one shows the internal structure of the active document. through links-click of an element the cursor in the document is placed on the position of the element. through the right-click of an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher in the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other building views. with it, manicable attributes and namespaces can change. based on the content of a contract, the change of all available attributes with a few clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technology for your development. it can be pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'document site to create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and considered.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two cardboard slip at the bottom of the window, can be achieved using the beneficial information: the news window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This card rider provides information about each in Quanta running script. this way, for example, the DTD used by the current document and all changes to the DTD display.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This card rider indicates all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed, give all error messages (so it gives) to this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool-tools are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with e-mail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as a compressed Tar archive above & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, they can secure these in & quantaplus; like any other secure and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of & quantaplus; files on your system. therefore, autoconf has to be handed over to the configure script. to get a complete list of options available to the configure script. / configure --help file. the options are simple to understand and do not run here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems with starting from & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should ensure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is located in front of her bin folder.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; became optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well-engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers began to deal with & quantaplus; a separate, extensible Markup languages would be? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>

<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by seizures or, by removing the tick, clinging from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project-assistants contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings may be updated in the menu with project project properties in the sub-window profiles in the subwindow profiles, or with the keyboard Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project-assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (wildcard possible), which can be recolored in project-related operations like project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Supplementary option to the top, also files that are listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view that is loaded at the opening of the project. in order to be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">Thus the debugger can be selected. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed is found in. the debugger plug can be set with the button Options. in this case, the debugger can be described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the subwindow profiles, upload files (see in) can be adjusted, as well as the display of a site view for the content of the server for each profile, showing your own construction view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the context-window team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the under-window configuration, you can turn off event actions and add these actions, change or delete these actions. events actions are executed when a previous event occurs, such as the Sighting of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. this behavior can not currently be influenced.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, choose a project... from the project project or the Symbol Project open from the toolbar. the dialogue project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes prior to leaving if & quantaplus; changed files will occur. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">Project overview gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folder behave as well, but the entries are missing open and opening with... within the right mouse-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can choose different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploading files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows the removal of the current profile. if only more one profile is present, the button is bewildered to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the cache and will be forgotten by programing. this possibility is useful if common uploading files is needed and the rather unsecure password stored on the record -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the flood.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-profile profiles can be created and thus uploaded the project (or parts of the project) to different servers. when working or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied. either a full qualified domain name or IP-address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for the uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed Kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs can choose.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for transfer. usually this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator runs a service not at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk so it can not be read simply, but everyone with programming experience can be easily seen in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just a set files and tool. it can give in one project many views, i.e. by simply exchange of view, various files and tool can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored in the menu project or project toolbar, accessible via settings tooling tool toolbar, open or deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps productivity but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars are in & quantaplus; best to be able to perform the toolbar menu. use and add-up to the toolbar is treated below in the section toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can either be set up using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can remove, toolbar rename or toolbar, which leads to dialogue where actions can be visible on this or other tool.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, additionally the entries will remove action and operate the action that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool-tools and the actions on them can set up in the menu with setting options... and settings actions can be set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Assists are essentially documentaries, code carvings and files for links. & quantaplus; used basically like a common filesystem, with expandable organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or paste each other to the system available in the previous tree; assists in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you imagine for the filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template used before using accurately.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binz is all that is not purer text. it can be inserted any file except text, so images, & PDF; s, flash files & etc. binary templates are usually included in documents using links (such as pictures with IMG src = / src / url). some examples are available in the preliminary tree under global templates. additional information on the Templar tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any text document. based on these templates, new documents can be created. normally a simple rumor for the purpose and organized the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the preliminary tree under global templates. see in for more information about the templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not included a new document based on a template, but the same text area again and again into the documents. you can find everything from a comment on Javascript or perl. some examples are available in the preliminary tree under global templates. see in for more information about templates tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these Templates for entire websites as templates. they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a compress tar archive. at present, there are no examples in brackantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure after exposure (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and select the file as a template save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once that has been done, you notice that (even if it is stored as a project situation) the template is not visible in the project tree. check in the pre-tree tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click on file as a template store as a local / project situation. alternatively, the selection can be easily drawn with pulling and deriving on the designs.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: to copy the file only into a single folder. it can be used all file management functions, such as pulling and descends or paste the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files to create a name for the template and secure. by default, the project folder is secured, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project boards allow a very target-oriented proceeding. you can put headline and footer or dynamic with a PHP, design, insert files or link with them. additionally you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound.</seg>

<seg id="2210">To set the behaviour of a folder in the template overview with the right mouse button on the folder and in the context-menu properties to choose. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is deducted as soon as Elterlicher Attribute verbank is hailed.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits to everything except the stem cell. if a regular folder would basically disable, unless they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text building. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a regular folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a set-up or presented text for templates in this folder. this could be general headline or footer for all templates for a specific project and allows copying of content templates to a folder with special headlines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the matching headlines / footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have the right-click menu (click to show right mouse button) about a full command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & source code editor that shares via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code in two parts: the source code editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and one cursor. then you can edit and turn back to the source code editor, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor will be visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that includes & PHP, shows a small green symbol the Vohandunision of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor, the source code is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first, except that simultaneously the changes both in the source code editor and in the VPL; editor will be visible, this mode is already active, the touch will shift the active cue from one window to the other, where the position is kept in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation dialog between the VPL; editor and the source code editor allows you to choose between VPL; you can choose between synchronisation after a click or automatically. in the selection automatically the price can be adjusted in addition to time. in principle, the recommendation is: a small Spanne for fast computer and a large garage for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, the tooling features will be used. the document characteristics will also be called when a new document is created with the VPL; it is used as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this will help the reduction of the suspension code. this allows you to change the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta-tags permit the storage of information about the document itself such as keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed. one click in the list allows the amendment to the content such as key words on the column name and keyword key word verbt2 on the content -column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add CSS rules with the buttons under the list or delete. a change over the list is exactly as with the meta elements. working of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS-style template by pressing the file-open button and select the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursors is as possible in a text processing, due to moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the Cursor works as usual. text can be inserted through typing and deleted using setback or removing.</seg>
<seg id="2225">The insertion of tags will be made in the same way via tooling, such as in the source code editor. it is noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded by text, any other orbiting anchor will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tooling such as the tables-assistant or lists assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; work in this release must be used the tables or lists of tool.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for comparisons. why so & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merger was very complicated, because one of the contributory had made many changes and at the same time corrected many places the insertion. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result were numerous conflicts with the result.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what changed exactly within these lines. and there was no indications of the places where perhaps only the re-setback had changed. this change was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could be differences within a row and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare fast text, just copy it into the clipboard and add it to one of the comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">One function that did a lot of work was the same and together of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost in a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way-together is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to solve conflict and shows at the same time the result in an anticipated result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files at the same time:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; will also help you with the comparisons and complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder-together:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences in and serve out the possibilities of current colour invisies. if you need frequently check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tab are visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can look at a look at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble any more, if Yemen and the descendant will change.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">When a file is equal and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files are the same name, but in different folders, then you can ease the tipping work by complete the filenames of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder-2 folder-2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3-o target folders</seg>
<seg id="2294">Open dialog allows you to type in file name, the selection via the file browser (file...) or select a last modified file from the list. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences will be performed with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Over the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you choose a folder, the comparisons between B and C however is a folder, then used & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If together, the input field is active for target and can be dealt with. however, it is not necessarily required to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later on saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The plug-in button opens up a dialogue with settings. here you can set options before starting with the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in open dialog, you don't have to select files, you can close the dialog with the interrupt button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and remove them: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Which thought is behind it? sometimes, a file contains such functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, this would be a relatively large effort. you would only need to create two appropriate files, load it into & diff3; then download the relevant sections simply copy, paste and then compare.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot draw anything from & kdiff3; only drag the text into a former window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and deriving of text into another program than cutting and inserting (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">In the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filenames and the row number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optionally). (if the path to a file is too long, the mouse will drop a while above the line. then a small aid window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is recognized, one sees in the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the pre-introduced color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that's in the next section (together) to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">Links next to the text is the compilation column. if differences were found, the column shows the appropriate color. in some programming languages the color is not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line that separates the collisions-column from the text, is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the row break is activated, the line is displayed in broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison table) has also an info line with the output issue:, the filename and [...] when you edit the result. usually it contains by the automatic composite already text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, the storing is deactivated!!! (use the buttons are to be found in the context of the unresolved conflict in order to find even remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison belts are used, each difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. (this will also be a jump of the position in the windows, where the start of the group would otherwise be highlighted.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for the current area and each on the left is a black girder.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more row in the group, or by manual editing, no more row is left in the column; then this text is only a wildcard for the event that you change your mind and perhaps choose another source. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a marker you might copy and elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; compilation of conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources the options are ignoring numbers or ignore ignore C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating navigates mainly with the scroll bar and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are in one of the windows, you can use the arrow-end, bottom, bottom, shrub off and shrub, siw as you can also use it from other programs. the Excel column next to the vertical frame bar can also be used for navigation.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auctions window you can also use the other keys to work. with the insert button you can switch between inserting and overhaul mode. (default is the plug-in mode).</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the submitter column synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as mentioned in the section) and the editable output window was explained).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons on navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-bottom / Strg-below), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-below / Strg-Picture Abward) or the next / previous conflict (Strg-below / Strg-Picture Abward) or the next / previous conflict (Strg-below) or the next / previous conflict, continue to resolve as a conflict. therefore, between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be made.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker into the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this option is enabled, whatever you mark, be automatically copied to the clipboard and drop the manual copying. be careful with this option but you could accidentally oversee the content of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Forefathers are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors will use a line-love character\, and Win32-based systems use Wagenre-shoe\\ r\. Kdiff3 keeps the drawing of the source files not with, therefore you should use & kdiff3; neither with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files are automatically saved when running automatically and restored to the next launch. (menu registered - &gt; Klin3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, dialog also includes writings with variable width to choose from, you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are presented in short text. if the chosen script does not support this presentation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be shown astasted. on these systems the button preferences automatically introduces a odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is activated, when pressing the Tabulator key, the appropriate number of spaces is inserted. otherwise, a spreadsheet character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you want to enter or return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next row.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If enabled, each selection will be copied automatically to the clipboard. the manual is dropped into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which pointer type to be saved. the preset value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">At the same files, & kdiff3; first, all completely identical lines in the source files can be found. only during this first step, white signs can be ignored. the second step is compares white signs. in this step, white signs are not ignored. white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart '\\' and a pointer '\' at the end of a line, others again store only a line-like '\'. usually, if this option is activated, the cars are treated with different sizes, however, like a white sign. during that this option has to be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') ignored. in the outcome, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white signs.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensively looking for some smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In Automatic resign mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Triggers automatic all conflicts in white characters, using the chosen file as a source. (default is manual selection.) That's useful when white signs are less important for all unresolved white conflicts. if you are only considering that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments, if the options are ignoring numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapters to scan folders and Implementation. see for details under documentation for the directory comparison and interacting.</seg>
<seg id="2337">When a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version is attached the Suffix .orig. if already there is already a back-file with the Suffix .orig, it will be deleted without any further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">The language of the user interface adapts. changing this option does not account the current current programme. you must finish & kdiff3; stop and restart, so that the change will be active. (this option is set in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language there is globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoders can be adjusted separately for each entry. if you activate this option, it will be used for all entries the upper setting.</seg>
<seg id="2340">About the selection fields for coding appears a short reference, which is local code. (this cannot be changed here and it's purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file code for swelling files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the coding for each file is individually adjusted, even files can be compared and assembled with different encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have processed a file, you can specify which coding is to be used for storing.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing orders you could not function with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the warrant command can only be done with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can specify the coding of the output of machine vision commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off in order to subvert heaps of changes in the text or a review split. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignoring numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode all the differences between two of three files will be displayed. however, you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. according to selecting A & lt; B, A & b; -lock; C or B & b; -lock; C is shown beside the normal yet a second super-face column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines. simply complete the less important window. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Orders the comparative window adjacent to each other or overlap. this can also be useful for viewing a long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide immediately to bring the files together. a simple click starts the merger and uses the filenames of the final source file as a pre-set name for the output file. (if this function is used to re-run it again, then the name of the last used file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your needs. you can, for example, cut trouble-cutting parts or for correcting the repairing.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file it is handed over to this external command. if the command of the command is specified first (see above), the output of the instruction will be used only when drawing the command line. you can write your own preprocessor, which corresponds exactly to your needs. each input line must have an associated issue line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The thought behind this is to make the user more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program requires, and most users would like to program it self-programming. however, the good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this procedure for newline to convert the input into large letters: sed it /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 'The\\' The\\ 'The\\' The\\ 'The\\' The\\ 'The\\\' The\\ '\'\ 's\' The\\ 'The\\\' The\\\ 'The\\\' s text.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically generated drawing chains (info: / CVS / Keyword Substitution). you can modify the\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 's\\\\' s'\\\\ 's'\\\\ 's'\\\\ '\\\\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you are experimenting with sed, you may begin to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of a further demonstration command of line. sed it / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and each matches will be replaced by nothing, thus quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several settings at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl. perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replacement / switches' However, are perl some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) requires perl only (and) without the above '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after normal preprocessor will be maintained for display and for the display. further operations only change the data, which sees the line-away algorythmus.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the line-preprocessor sees the output of normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The predictor commands are very useful, but as with any function, the text changes or differences hidden, you can accidentally notice certain differences and destroy major data in the worst case.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare with & kdiff3; complete folder recurly compared and guide.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... making a suggestion for every object to put together; you can adjust the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate this and shows the simulated changes without putting it really,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... offers selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparisons between individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are assembled, folder 1 will be used as base. if no target folder was specified, it used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folders.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, do not bring it together. to launch this, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 button. (more details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder you will find a small message window on current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folder, only the files are listed until then.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is complete, displays & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left-hand side...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and every folder that was found during scan, is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can double the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object or by clicking the arrow buttons for the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions all subdirectories, and add all subdirectories to which you can catch all folders and folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you click on a file, the file will be started and it will appear in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case the meeting action will not be automatically re-elected. if that will work together, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red, green, yellow and black.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical inserts, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if your overall content is identical. then also folder the same color. at folders, the age is irrelevant for his color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaflet, which is only green, then yellow becomes and later, when it is old, red becomes.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy of B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory file types. as long as such error-erous objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B did not have the same file type (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): errors: contradictory file types. as long as such error-erous objects exist, this cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders were specified and if the config option is synchronized, then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both files are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but are not identical: merge together and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible file name for the output file only B; directly after the result copied & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are assembled and the option new file will be selected instead (unsafe) then examined & kdiff3; the date of files and suggests the newer file to the copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. While such mistakes can not be eliminated, the folder can not be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">While this one cooperates a file according to the other. it's status column reveals Fertig, if this has been successfully completed, and correspondingly other messages, if something unexpected, if something is finished, you should check out a last review and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the installation dialog the file-method of complete analysis is selected, Kdiff3 further columns will display. these contain the number of unsolved, soldered, not white and white conflicts. (the column for soldered conflict will only be displayed when three folders are compared or assembled.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either create the just selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have chosen all the contraceptive actions (also in all subfolders), you can start this together.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified any target folder, then in three-folder mode C is used as the goal to merge in two-folder-assembled B as target and used for synchronizing A and / or B used as purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a target folder, please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure, even in the folder structure. there are several options by which specific entries could be skipped. check these options for unloving surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To link all entries: select a directory-up and continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to run only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If contradictory data types still exist without conflicting actions, a message appears on the faulty elements. you can then select a valid promotion for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you bring all entries together, a dialogue window will appear with the options, simulate and aborting.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simutil when you first want to see what would happen without the really modifications made. you will then get a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; will then execute specific actions with all entries. if a manual procedure is necessary (together with a single file), then one will pop up together (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select a new directory and continue or press F7. if you have not yet saved, appears a corresponding dialogue. then leads & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; on a mistake, appears a message and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you'll see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem. so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with it.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries were individually assembled, notice & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and leads them later in the later list. even if this file has been revised or not saved, these entries are changed once more. only if you change the composite action, these entries are again assembled.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (menu settings - &gt; Kdiff3 set up...) now has a section called directory-up with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match to the specified pattern are shown on the element tree. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default setting is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary-tree; it can be more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separators. valid space-holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary-tree; it can be more than a pattern, use the semicolon; as separators. valid space-holder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that are ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / CVS / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a composite attribute. in other file systems marked an advanced point. this option allows you to decide whether these files are to be displayed in the elementary-tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When links to files: when the option is switched, symbolic links are compared. if the option is switched, the files are compared to which the links show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is switched off, the links are compared. if the option is switched on, the links like normal folder will be treated and recursively filtered. a link to a folder of a link on yourself would lead to a final loop and cramped;) This option is switched off in the default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics. (the number of solster, unsolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and substantially slower if it is applied to files that contain no text. (type an appropriate Anti-pattern).</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare a large folder via a slow network, it may be faster, only change the change of change and file size. however, this speed machine does not cost you a certain level of safety. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to trust the changelment date. the files are considered identical when they are equal. it can be useful for example if when copying the change of change. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enabled the synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions are connected to the network so that the results are stored by the files in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe as it will be the knowledge provided that the other file has not been modified. you should check this in any case.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">When a file or a folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed with the .orig extension already exists, this will also be deleted without further backup. this also concerns the normal composite of individual files, not only the composite folder. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Usually, the folder together with the mouse will be visible, you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want to, you can switch the window list & text window to switch window in the window menu and switch between directory & text window between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can use a single file also directly with the folder menu. as soon as you save the result, the status will be completed and the file will not be assembled once you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"" "however, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: new" ""</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO-slave. Kdiff3 uses this for reading files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to Open, which are located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with a FTP server. the second command compares a folder within a compress archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should you be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be mutilated. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.) for example, a file named / # foo # the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes using the used protocol. it follows a brief list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP: sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way of editing credentials or change of change. therefore, the permissions or change of change from the original has been (please note the confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files).</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main uses is currently used as differences viewer in KDevelop. KDevelop begins first always the built-in differences in the viewer. to launch Klin3, press the right mouse button on the Differension and then select in Klin3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Usually requires & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is applied as being KPart 3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - Kdiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. besides, this is unreliable, if the original files have changed since generating the patch file.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as part run, it only supports the comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. that together or the comparisons of folders is not supported in the Kpart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and Kdiff2 (well Heist es Compare) already exist. besides, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge together as the program diff3 of the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL-programs for a very long time and learned a lot by watching into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who went this way or go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You may have compiled the program from the sources and the configure-script should not be disclosed to the correct prefix. at the default configuration in / usr / local, but then KDE can not find the resources for the user interface (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find further information on this subject.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white signs are different, these lines are sometimes treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is considered not identical. if similar lines are next to each other, this borderis, but this is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost when the result is easy to save as text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format, which might save this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was so far too big. you can restore a specific version always by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text should be used for another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is a sudden; no src lineage; and the text does not delete it. what does that mean and how can this be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors for producing differences. even more stocking would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and fault reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; use, you need & kde; 3.1 or new.</seg>

<seg id="2446">(in the current version version, you have to re-read the folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries shown that have differences. this also leads to that identical files will not be copied to the target folder. if the target folder does not already contain, they are missing according to the target version. (behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Watch the buttons on selecting the source with the marking A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. Underfire in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& moumouldtool; emulate a mouse-click, once the mouse cursor a while at the same point. it is meant to help people suffer the repetitive ray in Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse-click pain. furthermore, it can emulate the mouse with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& moumouldtool; can handle the ache, which occurs when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to utilize the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also suffer from pain involving your computer, you should seek a doctor if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it once again: even though & kmouldtool; pain helps eliminate the causes associated with the mouse, it is against pain that is caused by the use of the mouse, useless. and as with all ergonomic auxiliary means: the result may be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & mouthsettool; is simple: & mouthsettool; watch your mouse movements and guides a mouse-click if you break down the movement shortly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart shift is activated, makes & mouthsettool; a pause, after being running the button of mouse-mouse before the detachment of the mouse button is executed. in this way you can execute the finish at pressing mouse button. in this way you can run the pulling in the pressing mouse button. the intelligent verb takes a little practice, but you get used quickly by it.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This deviation time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before & moumouldtool; one mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If intelligent it is switched on, the speed field difference is dipped (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & mouthsettool; after downloading the mouse button, before you start the mouse button again, if there is no claim for the mouse in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& mouthsettool; supports now the click of mouse-Shift. this function now creates a slow move to the right and back, followed by a break, a click with the right mouse button. a slow move to the left and back leads a double-click. these movements are started in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousettool; the first time started, but they can be modified later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound appears, you can & kde; to do so, move the reaction time to shorten. open the & controlcenter;, go to sound & multimedia, select sound system and here the rider General. there is a slider sound buffer to shorten you to a lower value to shorten the responses.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is marked, & mouthsettool is started; at every launch of & kde; this feature is currently available only at & kde; available at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to automatically start a program there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Sets all settings back on the values which were set at the opening of the dialogue. have you already pushed the button applicators, the settings will be reset to the last press of users.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best to use & kmousettool; first with the presets. in particular the smart relocating you should be turned off first. if you then click to the automatic click, you can later drag the smart shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to decrease the responses of & kde; to decrease sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which does not constitute a link, does not lead to unearthed reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you would like to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse prints, you should cleanse your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First, you need to take out the mouse-ball. as that happens, from mouse to mouse, it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the roles. these are on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used. the dirt and the soiling can be easily swallow with a flat blade or the fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & mouthsetter; if you have just begun to push the smart shift, this means that & mouthsetter; the operation can no longer end using the slogan of the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousettool; under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can run a mouse click. this is reset the status of & mouthsettool; it is reset, and you can work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & moumouldtool to execute and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor, where you want to have it. however, you can't see the mouse on a neutral area of work space when you are a keynote mouse. so you can't see a distortion of mouse button. secure zones for the mouse-cursor are & win; the gray areas around toolbars and menus and the front lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to move with the intelligent shifting, but I don't manage to edit it text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent relocating is an advanced function of & moumouldtool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to copy it into the clipboard and re-insert it or move any other action in which you want to move the mouse into pressing mouse button. however, there will be some advice to them:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent relocate if you just start using & kmouldtool; to use this text rather: execute a mouse-click at the end of the text box, while you move the mouse button down to the other end of the text and once again pressing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this button, everytime you play a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when intelligent resize the difference period begins. later, you can use the smart shift without using the audible mouse click. however, it requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmouldtool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; it should be the case on most systems already.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeakers and that is a correct set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& moumousettool; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse-cursor briefly lapsed. this program was developed for people who suffer from the RSI syndrome and to which the bedside of the mouse's pain is prepared.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts;. for normal working with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is dealt with before being sent to the program speech dispatcher. they are useful for improving the pronunciation in order to select correctly stated words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker, or to bypass certain shortcomings of voice fibers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the working method of filters, it is important to know how the program "speech dispatcher" works with a text. & tts; distinguishes four kinds of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen reel has the highest priority. it is drawn up to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is pre-read, the orders are continued again.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news as & eg. processor is too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and regular text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & mouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg is welcome to read a long text on a website, you can welcome to & mouth; someone welcome the room. & cold messages are also messages. read about this.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text entries. each order to initiate orders from the card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text entries. text contracts are intended for issue longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queue, except the output of screen reel. if an application is sending the output of a screen reel, while & tts; just another preread, this issue will be stopped and ended.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen reel. you will be applied to regular warnings, messages and text entries as well as on & des.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter supplies the text and pass it on to the next filter. at the moment there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are run as modules. in the future, there can be further kinds of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Strings replace parts of a text by other text. you can specify either words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be delivered with predefined strings as: -) by text or for the formatting of messages from & conversation; or & kmail; into a better intelligible form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformer use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - transforms) to convert & XML; from a format into another format. included in the delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files to translate "& XHTML; in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With Interphone opters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or, depending on the program, which has the text on & tts; sent to a speaker. if you have set for example on the card presenter to read a female voice, you can read text from KDE messages about it. Siehe read about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filter has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules does not apply, he continues to keep the text unchanged at the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text job, a message, warning or a & kissing; sent to & ktts; sent it by all the activated filters supplied on the page down. processing through the filter is carried out in sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This displays the list of standard normal filters. if a filter is not crossed, it is not activated and is not used. filters are labeled the row down from the top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter and it will display the following setup dialogs.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting up strings you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. these patterns are exchanged in the text, then the text is replaced with the associated replacement code. large and lower case is not observed when compared.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name for any number; he only has to distinguish himself from the name of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string lines made in the column. the list is processed in the sequence from above downwards.</seg>

<seg id="2728">Here you see the set-border filter filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as presetting-border filter. you can modify its settings or add further statuses filters, beginners will be deducted from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">On the easiest way you will learn the selection of speech selection by trying out. turn off the card selection, change a number of features and check how the selection of the speech is altered. of course, you have to have done more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffectual.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; to start faster with the start, since only the first proposition must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can keep text entries on the carton card or break off, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons the normal detects filter is automatically set up if you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, just remove anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tab sign (decimal codes 8) at the proposition limits (tab is removed from the text). note that the standard-stretching filter is enclosed in character.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filter will never be applied to & kde; -News (kp), warnings, messages or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed from comparisons to the normal punctuation filter, you can insert it again by charging the file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Highlight this setup field if the property is to have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor when understanding the issue, it will always use this property. the only case you may want to specify the attribute language, is before you know that a specific application is sent text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all properties in the field of speaker, which corresponds most to the following is to delete, click on the selection button, and then use the speaker that corresponds most to the following.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the R & controlcenter; which allows the management of the network interfaces, the routine and the DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows users to manage a number of system and desktop settings for a uniform, integrated interface. the & controlcenter; can be accessed by selecting K Menu-controlcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf: package has been developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way, as other settings from the controlworkstation; to create a simple surface for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation a new module network settings at & controlcenter; displayed. network settings (knetworkstation;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkstation; network hardware is not able to install. physical devices and their drivers have to have been installed and configured, so that & networkstation; the device altogether provides and the setting of network properties allows.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed at installing & Linux; with installed and furnished. network devices later added, the drivers will need to be loaded by adapting the following files, according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The network settings will be loaded when the option network settings at the & controlcenter; index selected will be chosen. at the startup of the module network settings, this system is automatically credited to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform can not be recognized, the local selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release is best meets. by flagging the setting Not-again, the setting can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be automatically set accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2806">The change of network settings is possible only in the system administration mode. previously, all options are grey, meaning the settings can be considered not possible. in the system administration mode, you get to the system administration mode at the right bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. this is divided into three horsemen:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab interfaces is used to manage network devices of the system. all available networks are displayed. from the rider network interfaces, the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The default settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the button Advanced Settings shows the dialog with further possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in the automatic mode, TCP / IP-settings are necessary for the system simultaneously with the launch of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server will be necessary for any further setting. in the selection list can be selected either DHCP or BOOTP according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The choice of manual can be specified without DHCP or BOOTP. in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask is defined.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is marked, the system initializes the network interface in the boats. if the initialisation is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values in this dialogue are shown as properties of the device in the device.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network will not already be used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. by ping in the & Console; you may find whether the requested address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on the need. switch of a switched network device is checked by selecting the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your requirements. switch off of a activated network device is enabled by selecting the list and clicking on the interface.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the host in local subnet that conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other subnet networks.</seg>

<seg id="2833">For installation of binary distribution (mostly rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt have been installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and & kde; not, but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things is required.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only experienced users. however, it is not difficult, & knetworkstation; to compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information on basic network technology will be given, in the second all by & knetworkconf; changing configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area can not replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this attachment, only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is taught.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP-netzworks with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found large distribution. from IPv6 it is expected that in the near future, this description focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to assign which IP-address of a network interface is assigned. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace is the contact point, which is a valid IP address, or if available, the IP address can not be chosen easily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting an own small (home) network, the IP address should be chosen for such purpose reserved to avoid IP-address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses of the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore its use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, mostly addresses in the area of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 is used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all computers are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the standard route is required for the IP Rewards.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The C7.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat: is a backup program for band-runs on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape. the first goal was to establish a surface for tar, which offered the ability of dds2tar to a fast, selective clearing. the second goal was to answer a question which my wife asked: how much longer takes it when you secures?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be consulted by & kdat. that can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; split the band back and read the pre-voltage information of the bands. detects & kdat: the provisioning on the tape are not asked, you are asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Detects & klag; the provisioning, looking for the appropriate index on your record. can not be found, you are asked if the band index is to be created new.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the belt work is changing, to indicate that the band is involved. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the content of the belt can now be searched through out of the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In front of the failure of the bank, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& Ledat: gives you a change in the symbol for the belt, that integration was solved for the band and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat files can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">One band's types have to be formatted before you can be used to store data. this process does not comply with formatting at & kdat; it does not have to happen before you are formatted by using the belt. floppy band drives usually do not use a formatting of the belt, DAT drives, however, not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity drives & kdat; with the formatting of the belt. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the procedure, the belt is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you encounter the backup process, you need to select the files you need. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or a folder in the local file tree; it is only backed up to that file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Highlight a backup profile in the tree. it will only be backed up in the profile files.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Highlight files in local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the menu Sight...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup was introduced, the dialog settings for backup. in this dialog you will once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog appears to secure; the dialogue shows the progress of the process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "select a file or a folder in one of the archives in entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder is checked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">Highlight the files in one of the archives in entry for the band with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test run has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for checking.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verifying, the dialog appears over. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can restore the Restore, the files you should be restored, be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that will be entry for the belt work. it will only be restored the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or a folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialogue will appear for restoration. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for restoration.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialogue will be reinstated. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the transmission rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be a necessary to create the bandindexfile with the band's content. this process is deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index on two types from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">In this way, a backup profile with the currently marked files and the default settings will be created. you can make a backup profile the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should take place. the list of securities files will be automatically updated in accordance with the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under hedging files, applies that only the files are stored in the same file system, as the folder. folder, which are on other filesystem, you can apply separately in backup files. each entry is seen by tar regardless of the other.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file will be used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last intact backup is used.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons; puts; and lt; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can set you above the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the belt works (usually / dev / Tape). this path must refer to the non-revitch version of the belt device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat; before the tape is involved, the command will be loaded to drive. for some drives, this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Is the option switched on, tried & kdat; to block the throw from the bandage. possibly this setting does not work with all band members.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is switched on, while solving the integration of & kdat; automatically the band discarded. use this option not with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option switched on, tried & kdat; the hardwareseious block size for the bandage change. not all drives support variable block sizes. whether this attitude is active or not, you must communicate & kdat; in any case the block size for your band's work will communicate.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a band formatted, it writes a file at the beginning of the bank. this file should only be shown a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n byte) The band ID. the format of this string is calculator: seconds, where calculator was the full name of the system on which the volume was formatted. seconds, the number of seconds, which have passed since the epoch, in which the volume was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar-archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar administer. even other tar versions should work, as long as it is not about incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the content of a backup database. this symbol is only active if a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users access the quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer makes in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified version of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who can't know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access the quick access for example to information about problems which occur on their server. & ksystemlog; thus, tries to provide some advanced features, using which the protocol files of certain programs are filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has a number of useful features. among other things include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included in addition, and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available, with whose help the individual protocol lines of a protocol-file is easy to filter and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After starting the launch & ksystemlog; first, the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocols - to open the system protocols; very likely not start with system administration right. the protocol files are usually found in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually does not have permission for reading.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter sidebar to filter a select string in the filtering block. the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only log-line will be shown to the selected filter. then, a protocol-line contains only if in one of the columns contain the string of the filter search device.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. select the string search box then only with the entries in the column select column. select for example in the filtering file system protocol, showing you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are shown with a showy color as protocol lines the level notice. the colored representation of protocol lines can be switched on furniture dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the cron protocol), so you can hide the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the launch of the samba server. in this case, use filtering.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can jump the option to view new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new lines-lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage. once you selected a window, select a protocol for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dort you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; you will also find in the following folder of the & Folde; Subversion Archivs: ksystemlog; in & Archive; - Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kk; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & sysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init develops quickly for the control of the program starts at the high-end of the system in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binder is under / sbin and not below / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone might try to make a machine to system V init without making a reinstall and re-formatting. therefore, you need to ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from BSD Init that the configuration files in a sub-folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for every system service, which you want to start at the high-end of the system or when changing to another round level. system services involve not such things as set-up, which is only once started. such calls are according to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also specify a rc.c in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out something what has to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard laplevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should start a line as the following in the initial range:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the pre-indicated runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you do something out, then get it repaired by starting the system and execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how did you start all the correct scripts? if you're typing -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is links to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How starts and stopping init actually system services? very simple: any of the scripts is written so it is an argument like start and stop. you can actually launch this scripts from hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one K involves, the script is called with the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I could & win; a server running, which leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; and beyond, I could also have a user-running, the & eg; & dote;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv. it should not be very difficult as the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not be trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of availabilities system services to one of the six round level to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by taking it somewhere else. this will only happen if they draw an entry from the area of Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved, if you copy them into a new area. to select them only on a new runtime, you must select specifically copying from the menu or insert from the context menu, even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an item can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try to include the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries into the recycle bin so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different workspaces (Available system services, running 1 stop, runtime 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another running level, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired round level with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an order manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. join the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings will be stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise, it will be restored by & ksysv. changes to the presets are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I've experimented with the standard lapleveln, and now the machine starts up-to-date. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to launch in an individual user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard laplevel to a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to execute under Running X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual from distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way, such as system services are restarted in these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you use any other distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (like & eg; Apache and httpd) are just without notice if their configuration files are not present or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the running level, so that this manual can be attached.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Once you have made changes, you must save it. either use the appropriate toolbar icon or the entry to be saved in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user and user list. for use, select the desired user or the required group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user-or group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some card cards are only shown if you have extended extended system settings. only if you have limited restrictions (Quota) for users, a cardboard card will be created, if you are able to make individual settings, if wrong cards or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card administration passcodes appears, if shadow-passwords, or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card card appears only if for at least a single-connected file system (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem). here you can change parameters for each user, whereby space restrictions are available in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set on individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected, with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card supports groups informed about the group's participation of the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the field of primary group. furthermore, the user can become member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog's characteristics of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add out of the menu user or group or click the appropriate toolbar button. the edit or deletion of the selected user and the selected group is analogous.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, remove the bootpassword, remove and change the time up to the boats of the default operating system, remove the standard operating system, remove, change operating systems, modify, change and more.</seg>
