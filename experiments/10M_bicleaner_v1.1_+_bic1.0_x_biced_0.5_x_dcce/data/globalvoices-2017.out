although I had visited the US for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , have danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had a profound effect on me , that I was directed mainly because of an American film journalist .
when the 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ atic letter , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ff , who covered the Supreme Court with judges , who were inclined to seize his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only increased my admir@@ ation for the United States .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then , Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me , as he continues with his narrow @-@ minded approach .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
he says exactly what he thinks , how a former colleague put it , and openly explains his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes which he won during the Republi@@ can elections was the highest number , who ever reached the nom@@ inate candidate .
I was spee@@ ch@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I was unable to reconcile Tr@@ ump and its voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , takes people from all over the world , a deep unbelie@@ ver person , with whom I could entertain myself about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ umps World illustr@@ ative not coinci@@ ded with the Peter B@@ h@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
B@@ h@@ atia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
Tr@@ umps In@@ som@@ nia is also a contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for her life long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son .
she is still adapting to Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then , there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot with my career .
these people and those who are em@@ bodied by them are deepening my love to America .
while Tr@@ ump has eased his way to the nom@@ inees of Republi@@ can presidential elections , they offered me a stop and the counter@@ part of his limited vision of America .
it turned out however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps , because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the examination of the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared either its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart .
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to arrange the person , one of my friends said , is exactly what we have led to that situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is superficial and respectful and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not considered .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might want to say that in this America they are still important ?
maybe .
however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment@@ ated on the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does . : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ armament of white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : word of white in cont@@ ent@@ ment at the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means as much like s@@ ling@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones , has exactly killed what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people all over the world value the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or the background one always likes , America is every welcome .
for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
but with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , however , there is a huge part of the white America of this promise , saying , Hell with Vari@@ ety , religious freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin , they say .
in all that I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd answered with a vo@@ ci@@ ble &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brood the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a single and sound@@ proof &quot; NE@@ IN ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan closed with words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country , for which his son fell , sent him a message .
that is now Tr@@ umps Land , said the message .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America .
and this leaves me my heart .

out of the misery for the stars : these Latin American children do not spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero village in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music , played at both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is situated at the edge of a large garbage dump , only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city , which is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) is now playing in the community : a sym@@ ph@@ ony Symphony Orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty by their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and banking violence .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth become so rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious , the local press not@@ ary O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of the school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust roads to pursue their great passion .
you always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the Tru@@ ly you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , p@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from the garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material :
music with recycled instruments produced from local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycled under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of apost@@ asy in instruments .
the instruments im@@ it@@ ated viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , C@@ elli , double bass , guitars , sa@@ x@@ ophone , trumpet , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones , and percussion , all made out of the garbage .
the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by Los Angeles Times recalls F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the initial time :
first , it was very difficult because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the garbage - the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o somewhat was shown what he had never seen before : one out of waste @-@ made violin .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments produced from play@@ ed material and which is called The Port Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) stands out for the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world produces about one billion tonnes of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as men in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from garbage to music around the world .
the orchestra also played music even before Pope Francis ,
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication happens as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already been operated in li@@ fic@@ an waters illegal fishing , before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly ag@@ grav@@ ated and little inclined to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this kind in its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to give him one of their har@@ bours and refused to give it a fisher@@ man building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to spend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan Fish@@ eries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is part of a team who discovered the ship at its time and followed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the fish stocks of the country .
the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and safeguards resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illeg@@ ally f@@ ishing ( Il@@ leg@@ ale Fish@@ eries ) .
the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister of their waters .
&quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support .
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , whose due to it extremely difficult to assimil@@ ate . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the over@@ fishing of regions .
through the deliber@@ ate dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which specific habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate equilibrium .
however , while actions against illegal fishing once were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also passed through the sn@@ ak@@ ent@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions are happening in real @-@ time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses , information about suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
Fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea , through satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in the bot@@ t@@ ted regions - such as those who suggest that a ship will leave his domes@@ tic@@ ated fish on the way to other ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish License , where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a Stra@@ fre@@ g@@ ister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
countries that are against illegal fishing , may refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports . what does the ships do not sell their load to sell , and that they could even be forced to pay off pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we then deal with significant financial losses for the owner , which means that the illegal fishing fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , head director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a counsel@@ ing company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i .
a closed Front
the aforementioned platform was created to get estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing villages that attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these illegal fishermen .
its practices among other things include actions like the sailing under false flag , counter@@ f@@ eit license papers , stating from fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; specifically , you use the missing international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non @-@ fully organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , a ship could illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &quot; You do not want to walk my harbour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; com@@ m to me &apos; . and precisely this leg@@ alistic slip hole tried to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
since its inception F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships .
it has uncovered criminals that have distributed counter@@ f@@ eit lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has been persecuted and found @-@ fle@@ eting ships .
because of its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can split information to illegal fishing over large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organized crime &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , suspi@@ cious ships more precise .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be further developed will also help to divide the illegal ships who likes to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships may turn their automatic identification systems , with what they can no longer be ordered by satellite .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations have actually influence on this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown around the world through which the position of every single tor@@ ment@@ able ship can be shown around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts have a similar project to run where a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only feel criminals but they are also deter@@ red .
ships who exploited earlier without a license and hardly reck@@ oned with consequences , now they know that they are observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now has a 33 % increase in fisheries revenue , since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to record Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board gri@@ pping nets , whose use is forbidden .
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now we have other countries to copy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa a few hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined together to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , following exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety is the goal of bringing more such initiatives and structures even in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country could report its first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license and were used gri@@ pping nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong signal that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is a further success of many . and at the same time evidence that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the World Sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes about environmental , technology and nutrition .
her article will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is continuing to keep up : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of cap@@ turing the country . &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are regarded as protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum on the Office of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the leadership of the opposition rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted upon the political and economic crisis of the country in which they were gathered on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the appropri@@ ation of Venezuela ) can be found both by these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the region Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , central to Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continually , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by a acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition seen in the am@@ t@@ sen@@ ti@@ ring of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the tra@@ keeping of a re@@ election was blocked by the official authorities .

on Twitter are ima@@ ged pictures that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
especially large waves hit the message about polished oppression in the central @-@ north located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves from the police and armed support of the government .
hours later they could leave the cathedral safe but the protests went on .
in other parts of the country , some demonstrators , police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :

meanwhile an Info@@ graphic is already creating an Info@@ graphic that forms the scale of repression per day :

this is a adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo Gó@@ me@@ z , with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Córdoba .
in the meantime , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba against his father .
in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting at the Bür@@ de , the same names as his father carry to the brutal military per@@ ations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he was observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough .
for 34 years he held the family secret for himself .
in the situation back then , I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret magical .
as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , the latter and the mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie@@ g@@ ator . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy commander of the secret services department , 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la .

but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who over the years had seen the extent of the atrocities that he had been witn@@ essing as a boy , and who said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows , which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose to make a path to salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take part in the sports base , I often went to the sports hall , often with us . there I was rounded with a boy who did combat sport .
all n@@ called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an Ar@@ sch@@ loch , you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP .
passport only that they will not end you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina .
that is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base .
he said to me , I would be a secret .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine . because so my father loved me .
on the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university inclu@@ sions , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ ateri@@ al , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ dah , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - all in 1976 .
during the first time and last time he let me wait at the entrance to the car .
when he accepted me the second time , he commanded me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just all possible - stood .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a little into a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were shut down , and held me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I moved in and saw a couch , tor@@ tured on the human race .
it looked like a field @-@ bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cabinet . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
they rarely gets a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured him with water and said to him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the stu@@ d was inside there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty Win@@ del .
years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and to bind them .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also charged in the process ) and I took advantage of taking a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men face with the face down@@ ward - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entry point men still fell on the mattresses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noted that I saw for the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I dra@@ ined &quot; Why did you know me otherwise ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were referred to as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero had a man together and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data transfer by the civil war Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was also charged in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia leads the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former tor@@ ps .
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
if you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names have changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
if they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the top came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the euph@@ emis@@ ms - for the determination of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &quot; War of War &quot;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war @-@ skins &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military for myself - I was in gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war @-@ skins are a ba@@ za@@ ett or perhaps military bases which one accepts an enemy that one fights against .

but if you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then that is not a war @-@ but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officers with the Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and ste@@ al anything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
once he called me a crime and I answered , and you that you put cars on the street ?
you are not a crime ?
he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried :
if you go so far , then I will find you and help you .
we need no one else !
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time , on which I carried a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover made of wool , both my father made of La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes with home .
at that time accused me of defense , a fellow conspir@@ e with this crime would have been to be . I res@@ isted , no problem , they can put me to load what they wanted .
I was anyway there to guess .
&apos;@@ the di@@ zz@@ ling of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &quot;
now , where I am older , I find rec@@ ue .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
you develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , you have put it in the dictatorship of the dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why children relie@@ ve them ?
one day my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them into prison .
I reck@@ on it &apos;s just chosen to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
had these people not also families , who could be handed over to their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the tigh@@ tening of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was re @-@ introduced again , hol@@ ed them machines to eliminate the mortal rem@@ n@@ ants of the prisoners .
they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and taken somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; said my Father .
but anything remains natural .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the Gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the thought , showing my father , was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I revealed to him for all the atrocities that I had to experience with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I did not kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt t@@ anned out and asked me what the entire exaggerated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they supposedly defended themselves , actually were good .
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me to participate as a child .
he only ref@@ utes &apos; Na I put me off . &quot;
precisely this did I do .
in 2010 I replaced the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame for me that I am taken before . I finally said against my own father .

one translation errors makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible drivers &quot;

editing of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers became a newly opened centre where one can extend its driving licence , last month witnesses of a very special translation .
at a shield , the Japanese word in the fact that the &quot; older motor@@ ist &quot; means , wron@@ g@@ ly , perhaps even with evil ho@@ ists , &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; were translated as &quot; terrible motor@@ ists . &quot;
the false translation was on electronic advertisements from the 1st to September 20 to read in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , often shared in the social media .
the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , one of the inhabitants of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also who made aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n &apos;s Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was first removed . the designation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fi@@ bers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ der drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto police ap@@ olog@@ ised for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not tested for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely hope that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) made of our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News set out a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fri@@ ghtful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police there are the percentage of older drivers involved in nuclear accidents , but quite cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents of sen@@ iors was caused by Sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , the Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11.@@ 850 oun@@ ces .
in this way , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
whereas the number of accidents in total decreased , the proportion of sen@@ iors caused by the elderly has risen in the same period .
the name not named repor@@ ters brought comments on the light published on Yahoo announced in Yahoo , which prejudices some Japanese seemingly against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo concerning the translation errors was given the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; so wrong is the translation really not , or ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it is a real translation errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .
photo from Flickr @-@ users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
to over@@ use one requires two key abilities : passive voice skills to understand the starting text and active language skills in order to transfer him into the target language .
the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with mother@@ boards . in general , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be .
so a French mother tongue should translate for example from English into French - not from French to English .
photo from Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue who could make translations into English . this may be lacking understanding of excessive , cost @-@ reasons , or the relatively small number of English native languages to learn Japanese .
some companies that even do not have foreign employees , leave the translations of their company internally . then , the Japanese staff , whose English skills are considered to be the best , no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo from Flickr @-@ users Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ati@@ m and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that are created by machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo from Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least be harmless at least . but by large companies or from the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect thorough translations .
the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ors on the Internet and television to be taken
main page of the portal , &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , the Venezu@@ elan internet user , that they would have no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later other users wrote that the Internet@@ auf@@ tr@@ itte from V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV are also no longer accessible .
other online channels presented the recordings of the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists groups who oppose the Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro@@ s government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s responsibilities to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the link is glu@@ ed , and recommended the U@@ sers , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# cens@@ or@@ ship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites ven@@ ez@@ ol is once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ers , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hesit@@ ant at the coverage of protest in 2014 . at that time , the Commission had initiated them with cash payments and lock@@ ings if they continue to report about the demonstrations as the Commission looked at this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and inform@@ ational national TV channels I have registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
ast@@ ounding that it is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ re le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay through a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) is in@@ accessible but also two other online channels . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly exceeds its meetings .
previous post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique that can cri@@ tically answer certain domains through which the DNA server requests certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds wrong or denied the request when calling such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ P@@ IT@@ V and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ P@@ IT@@ V , a third embro@@ i@@ dered channel , the transfer on Thursday , April 6 , ceased when the V@@ P@@ IT@@ V cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who carried out the protests in Caracas , was caught in jail .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police @-@ ahr@@ ing .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ P@@ IT@@ V went back on show .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ers access to multi @-@ media reporting about current events in the country ever more complicated .
in Paraguay many girls will get rid of slaves , to obtain an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina has been fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testimonies of other cri@@ es who have been exactly like they were victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of curator .
the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report of curator who is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the friendly permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ing@@ cows , dec@@ ayed schools &quot; ) , which is edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household in which she was not allowed to dine together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to her house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have become something that has become something &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , they referred to Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money out@@ puts her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange , the child will eat food , a training and a roof over the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that children must afford to spend countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract which one cannot lift up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls .
in doing so she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witnesses , researched and denoun@@ ced .
they tried to name things in the name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ ber , is guaranteed in general .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double del@@ usion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , she is the family that her daughter in believing that she will be able to complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; something out of themselves &quot; can be transferred to another family .
on the other hand , the family who performs the girl and his exploitation is justified by faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise be given no training and perhaps even star@@ ving .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
if the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the dark in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed up fierce beats . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Military Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the locals .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ un@@ cion .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira struck long as long as a stick on Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the Mur@@ dered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen society for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came to protest leaders and called for there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no further Carolina &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without Pap@@ ers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organizations called for a serious investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
if the case comes before the court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go court .
the daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the farms in which her father worked , she had to login and her father lost his work .
her brothers now had to work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina has been sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up every morning at 5 am and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
for example , she puri@@ fied the fridge , p@@ umping the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the ground .
when the school was at the end she went home again and had time to learn .
the more it was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but that time was limited because they had to have dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had hungry , but also didn &apos;t get un@@ limited food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the library of the house@@ holder as food from the fridge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she remembered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to some depar@@ tures of the house@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and to read editorial from opposition parties like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sen@@ ca@@ dero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them that reports of official media on the regime of dict@@ ator does not give faith .
he held it for intelligent , but did not stick with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened to , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they don &apos;t allowed me to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would be there again &quot; bad habits . &quot; thus , they said that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , to be able to speak their native language back home again .
their Lord feared that they had the formation of which they had made it , explained them again .
but she was totally clear that she had paid for everything they had from them , with their hard work .
also in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken , are bullying and the vic@@ tors who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ tas if they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is .
I could not invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in time where friend@@ ships develop , I felt especially clear that I was not part of any group .
the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explained Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .

law bill writes Egyptian users social media prior to register with government

&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliament@@ arians have recently agreed a bill to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users must register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law a job would then be set up to give citizens a permission to use social media .
within six months of adoption of the law , users and users would have to register with their correct names and personnel account numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
will it miss this to do so , that could bring up a sentence of up to six months in jail or a fin@@ er .
the bill that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ es and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as a &quot; je@@ d@@ we@@ e application that runs across the internet and used to communicate with others via voice , video tiles and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced if it is accepted that there is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should decide the users and users the registration . it is also unclear how to make up the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , parliament@@ arians and sponsors of the statutes , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that Facebook is blocked . &quot;
this could mean Egypt is planning a fire@@ wall on the national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network .
but so far it is not known that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; senior research @-@ related research institutes &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I never doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , then this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who apply for a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to engage in a judicial process .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legis@@ lature of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters into the plenary session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and enforcement shall be successful or not , the draft is consistent with one pro @-@ military thought @-@ art in parliament , in which sense the control is maxim@@ ized and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no dis@@ sent@@ ing Nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ oist of .
last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ war@@ y proposed a draft law against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifel@@ ong imprisonment for those provided to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Iraqi Kurdistan region in the northeast of the Iraq war , the wel@@ far@@ er H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost of Persian leop@@ ards .
a sub@@ species from the bigger family of leop@@ ards which p@@ ans through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to sav@@ age , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they always find less prey , at risk .
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a great rob@@ bery is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in Cameroon , R@@ aza breaks into pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ olog@@ ine , R@@ aza passion@@ ately shows a different side of their country , which exists not only of war and conflict .

in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o agreed to re@@ construct the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been affected by the &quot; Trinity catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fukus@@ hima had triggered a disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the Pre@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a number of Pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighborhoods of Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to disappear , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had disappear whole coastal cities out of the map .
even more , the pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima lived a nuclear accident , already alone because of that , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes .
the special report from the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o show that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re @-@ establish the lives of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ constructions as well as survey results of those concerned themselves .
the housing situation in Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings ( in the US market , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fukus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i has been the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was shown here , 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fukus@@ hima is 70 percent of the final light at Fukus@@ hima .
however , it is still trying to settle for six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated ev@@ ac@@ uation by Beh@@ ind shel@@ ters ( in the US ) , Kaz@@ ak@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final replacement houses .
after the thre@@ e@@ fold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people had forced to live in secret shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such pol@@ it@@ ations .
almost 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated people from Fukus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated shel@@ ters were nour@@ ished after the disaster in domination .
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is up here at 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
how the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 by 1100 schools who were affected by un@@ happiness , their doors until December 2016 , which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of fisheries har@@ bors in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , only 30 percent of fisheries har@@ bors their operation at Fukus@@ hima .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have taken a lot of passion in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of the agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of arable land , and less than 50 percent of arable land in Fukus@@ hima can be used again in Fukus@@ hima .
it is unlikely , that this is only a consequence of the nuclear waste , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of arable land of Fukus@@ hima lie in the &quot; nuclear zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered and recovered over again , but also here Fukus@@ hima still remains un@@ defeated .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ates are back up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . on the contrary , only 75 percent can be found here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it &apos;s harder to get their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
to determine a total picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys under the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated people . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how its emp@@ athy have changed in front of the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction of this article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper writes :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 per cent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in case of disasters @-@ prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated the Fukus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture .
in their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima .
Fukus@@ hima had not only had the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fukus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , Catalan , nuclear waste , if the Japan had ever had to experience .
almost 63 000 people of ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fukus@@ hima became almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , something more than 23 000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back after Fukus@@ hima , in permanent replacement buildings .
after the status of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ phen@@ ols , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated shel@@ ters are still less than 50 years old . they have to come back in right Beh@@ aus@@ ungen efforts , because efforts are competing for reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people encounter people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities .
after a while , one recognizes however often that a more connects than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important since they are asking our prejudices to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics , which often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members who want to remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone over language and country boundaries .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini speaks like the love of music has consolidated their affection for the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into intensive care unit : last Friday he had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke stock up against the head . nationwide millions of demonstrators participated in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ deer trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors made him Saturday this Saturday and now have put him into artificial coma .
his condition is considered to be critical .
the local journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which diff@@ used within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
in the pictures the face of the police officers is to realize that attacked with a stroke stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been re@@ united until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of the active service .
the pictures show the police officials , as he is in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
would a police officer det@@ ector from a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months long on television and the whole oppression would therefore be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of the media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video of Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided the video on the net in which one sees , as Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edic shortly thereafter to hurry to him .
another video filmed with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also found in social networks .
in the clip shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , we have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police power . &quot;

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further acts of violence against activ@@ ist in Go@@ i@@ ás into memory :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence . here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ ab@@ me Irish was killed by his father , because he was granted the Occup@@ y Movement at secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who was attacked on the intensive ward , after being attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an who has cast him down with a stroke stock .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where he came to brutal police attacks on Friday last Friday .
polic@@ emen set at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstrators established a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mi@@ tigation and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , the police asked via speaker to sacrifice violence against demonstrators .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the entire country .
once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ested by putting the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ists : a wind@@ shield .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo are specifically reported on a dis@@ sem@@ bled glass window to make an illustr@@ ative picture of a picture with a photo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o &apos;s preferred story must be a title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a fire @-@ placed bus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic basis , more about a broken wind@@ shield than over the protests of thousands of people who serve to defend a special thing .
this also needs to recognise when you are strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also here the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate , and the typical violence of military police are dec@@ eived by headlines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages of the Ent@@ indu@@ str@@ alisation For@@ gotten villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar factories in the whole of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the western Cub@@ an province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no noteworthy sugar @-@ harvesting on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane of sugar have been paraly@@ sed .
after waking up the sugar industry in the region fell silent , and the factory lost and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained .
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to re@@ invent itself .
some of them rarely changed the work .
other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veteran , which stands every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar ro@@ ar industry did not rob@@ bed his sleep .
he heard that there are su@@ gar@@ s in the east of the region of sugar , who are in operation after a long time because they were obtained .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene is reminded of having heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ I would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been held .
the sugar industry had already opposed the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ effici@@ encies , the bad administration decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amoun@@ ted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad experiences already have no news anymore .
why has the Cub@@ an sugar industry switched off ?
the old railway station of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need : the 155 sugar be@@ ad@@ factories were technically outdated , and barely competitive they were in@@ toler@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes .
they left only the factories that they can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives , which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to 2016 , published by the OECD and the FAO , the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would be in charge of around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years the lac@@ tation came from a total of 98 su@@ gar@@ s , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &quot; fraud . &quot;
nearly all respon@@ dents are the same opinion , not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order to get the place they made a full time - working group .
before the first turn of the first year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially recorded documents that would be removed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister was able to author@@ ise every decision .
from then on the responsibility was carried out , and the letters came more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the breastfeeding factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the land had no money , &quot; ass@@ ures him for the still in operation .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the im@@ position of the factory , with which he helped to work .
with any part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working @-@ de@@ parts was exp@@ ired .
in many cases , no alternatives for jobs and services were generated in the communities in which they found themselves .
we will never know whether in the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , when he saw President in the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that there were no longer in operation for the areas whose factories were running smoothly for five years .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar be@@ ad@@ factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high due to toll .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better if a factory is closed .
when the sugar be@@ ad@@ factory completed , or better said than they began to dra@@ ining it , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ign , this is also adjacent to other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy other factories had to look up .
they were made to spare parts .
without future perspective , many young people also left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production is not even for the supply of the municipality .
the ruins of the factory behind the new grounds are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty vom@@ iting the old soldiers an ann@@ u@@ ity of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a tra@@ verse person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not .
they have taken him for ten years .
N@@ ene is going over 65 years in R@@ ente , not because it lacks strength , but because it is bitter .

first Nations young people use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture

young people from the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them . they are doing this by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of migrant workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , since 2014 the workshop leader Mobile Ton@@ studios leads directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audi@@ o- and video @-@ production and live appearances .
the original workshops were run by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then working with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars .
the workshop is thus creating that the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ al@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , on which almost two dozen young women were missing or murdered .
the cases were largely ignored .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , in spite of the influences by globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people have not always control the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has been recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an is available to the verses in Belgrade , just a translation into English , which is translated from here into German :
sometimes I feel like wouldn &apos;t ever be interested in me
but I try to go on earth for my days
this is the day you will take our cry
because we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and equally as our youth move forward
how can they do what they determined to the Creator

plastic courts will not only be shown in the restaurant
plastic courts ( known in the US ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan one can gaze in front of almost every restaurant plastic meals .
to show potential customers exactly what is exactly on the menu , are being exhibited near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ se@@ pur@@ u ( which is known , &quot; Pl@@ astic models of the courts &quot; ) from each dish that is served in this restaurant .
the customers see these plastic courts and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacturing of these plastic courts .
in the Tokyo district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are numerous of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes , which made the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even find them anymore . however , a new trend is turning it into con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous cell phones and other gadgets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blog@@ ger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ se@@ aqu@@ u .
now on special sale : new with plastic courts decorate cell @-@ belts as shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
many of these man@@ made foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y @-@ objects , as in this case , Cooler Master magnets :
here are a few Sho@@ vels cooler for a new exhibit in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ es is more and more complex .
in this case , a ca@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel package with seafood ) turned into a mobile cord .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo train station .
and here is an apple who gives your mobile phone :
designed to see like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight .
some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ estrogen is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; are there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can make my mobile phone with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
this interest in plastic supplies can also take a less appe@@ tizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest phone @-@ stand @-@ handed has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ ors from dried salmon .
for more sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic courts , you can view at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 82@@ 17 ; in the fact that it means .
if you would like to know more about the origins of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ing of the Restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ok @-@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese S@@ culp@@ tures are actually going to be produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports in foreign and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico the mis@@ hes and gear@@ boxes regularly perform only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings this struggle to itself .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ man Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Z@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background .
on the day after a non@@ violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the sad@@ ness or the churches that have learned to live with pain .
they are behind every body , behind every bone , in the hundreds of en@@ mer dig@@ gers , the stories of countless parents , children and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds will never heal .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico gives the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug trafficking ) , should give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who rent a voice in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be afraid to fear our lives .
the impact is far more profound .
for example , when shops close , because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk .
the pain of victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian por el for@@ do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is secret every weekend of secret tom@@ bs after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez that lost her father on only one day , her four sisters , her husband and two of their ne@@ phe@@ ws .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priest : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have provided to go ahead and to gra@@ ves after the people we loved to look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 , when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th he was supposed to be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , which is also here with me .
at the moment they have no income .
you are in charge of my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not get paid out , because that require a mort@@ ar .
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vi@@ vir con el Nar@@ co will explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need not only show the faces of those who face fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian player from Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico .
your contribution reminds us that we should never consider violence as normal , no matter what type it appears :
I have known the disease and Sens@@ ational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front page with pictures , which can actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one , which is disgu@@ sted or sadly . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it writes on :
no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks that he is Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will , if he is great . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets .
for me it is , as if they be@@ ck@@ led those who have lost someone and those who fear that such thing happens .
I see our weakness if stories come to mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighbor town will be justified that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to engage in , that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not moving and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Haupt@@ stadt@@ distri@@ butes : &quot; as a family with threats has been lo@@ oted . &quot; in this , she describes how armed crime month for month money from her business , until they had not only destroyed the business , but their family had been torn apart .
you think of everything you lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
the ache on time never flies , the trau@@ ma stays , the fear comes up again if you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are removed , the better .
it included their report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will de@@ duct you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether I would resolve my deep @-@ ro@@ oting feelings , but the answers is no , for I forgot how to cri@@ es . I have to learn how to live with pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the post &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence signed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them .
Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells you had to teach yourself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and dairy powder .
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for all life of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years earlier , when he looked at only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , which was shot by armed men from a passing by car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was ming@@ led by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ sec@@ utor &apos;s Office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the section 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ a per day .
these are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories are in view of getting new headlines . but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 brought into life , whose aim consists of representing the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in intelli@@ gible way .
if a picture is worth a thousand words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages , to which he linked , contain images on which violence is shown .
the Fak@@ ten@@ check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift a rum@@ or , or for@@ gery .
but how is the years after something happens for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident at seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release , it was dec@@ ep@@ tive to proc@@ laim trage@@ dies which have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false cou@@ pling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful reporting on events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a petrol car spread the place San@@ ge in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . at the same time , 230 people came to life .
after the Civil War , Africa had been neglected land for years and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths that were difficult to drive .
iron@@ ically , the fire @-@ carriage fell victim to the victim of the tank .
official representatives discussed a fire@@ ball , the d@@ ashing houses , including a movie theaters in the proximity , which was full of people who see the soccer world champi@@ ons .
houses bent and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were disper@@ sed in the streets .
many people were burned down .
a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows series of stolen bodies that rests on the ground while people watch them .
but here the story does not find its end .
over the years the same photo was recorded several times in social media , blogs and other platforms , and cannot be attributed to the trage@@ dies in the context of the trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ov@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ye@@ witnesses also reported the atrocities of atrocities , prior to which they had to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ p@@ ses were in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 men were mass@@ ac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a local population of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many have been destroyed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be pic@@ tured .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army of army in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , land to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo , when it was mistaken as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris .
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this abuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of vac@@ ancies ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting on Nigeria since 2014 .
in all of these cases the picture was taken as a test@@ ament to mass kill@@ ings .
yet another step further bring personal comments like this example , the picture from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to supply arguments .
the image from San@@ ge joined in combination with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message , published by the United Nations those who were able to flee blows , rape and several deaths , some by burning .
while others reported by the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts , as the following , that these descriptions were brought together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture originates from an aci@@ on @-@ Arab news , which was alleged in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ mar@@ s Th@@ ein Sein have said , monks and politicians have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to show this information .
the original contribution , which recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organisations , the AF@@ P , referred to as their source , had also attributed to this statement as this statement , but had not been linked to the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cou@@ pling are back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opposite picture &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information borders can be crossed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a reverse picture @-@ search with the search engine ink Tin@@ Eye has shown below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the Democratic Republic of Congo .
they come from a blend of private pages , platforms of social media and common as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , so others have tried to expos@@ ing counter@@ fe@@ iting .
we have indicated examples of abuse use and linked them to the respective countries , based on what page they had been published on . thus , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also associated with each other ) several examples of abuse .
here are some cases that can still be felt completely ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fr@@ ames .
examples of false Cop@@ pl@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange colored countries indicate pages or servers that are still available on the examples of counter@@ fe@@ iting or fal@@ cons .
the countries in Gray are examples , which are according to the met@@ adata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also pun@@ ctu@@ ation examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( it addressed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arab ) as part of a thread to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this post , a blo@@ gger from Quebec City not only identifies the mis@@ message , but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the individuals and the wrapped trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) .

Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ omin@@ able use of the image from the DR Congo , on the one hand , pus@@ hes the sympathy to the Nig@@ erian massacre and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , as the photos of that were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .

this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , is clear that the picture of DR Congo will NOT show Muslims , killing Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein gave us that monks and politicians have been involved in the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim and brought together the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has explicitly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ p attack . &quot;
as the image later in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am from 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were ties to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ der@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the picture of DR Congo emerged , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and solve a discussion under Moslems according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve that their communities took these events , which took place in the name of Islam , a greater attention .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and over 9.@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were captured in no religious context .
instead , the goal was to raise awareness on the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that supposedly was dra@@ fted by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; by the Nig@@ erian massacre , there was discussion discussion such as this on Vietnamese and explained it to the Fal@@ se .
from the message , in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos .
there are other confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the cap in Grau ) features Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer completely trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data contracts with UR@@ Ls and tim@@ est@@ amps which exist on the web of the we@@ d@@ iner and isolated tent , they have image files related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original un@@ ison of 2010 , the image ultimately may possibly have a correct description but the original contribution is not available or available .
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) that undergo these post@@ ings . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used regarding greater discussions about the silence in the context of the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued as compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how images in connection with these efforts are used .
a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers do no longer believe these pictures .
with social media there are tens of people who have accidental loss to exercise the water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ - and false information , that actual atrocities are un@@ true and narro@@ w@@ ns it the real atro@@ city of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that with@@ hold images of a ref@@ usal to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent pictures readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ tise and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , explored how violent media work to help others ) .
while there are a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of the smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. D@@ t. insur@@ able ) endeav@@ ours to offer lingu@@ ists a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all .
such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ enfor@@ ce@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish Sob@@ un@@ esa ) .
but all contradic@@ tory to each attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and Lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in this blog you can find words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ ography language of Van@@ u@@ atu , as follows :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - opt for your parents in recognition of how you have endeav@@ ored to take you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ creen language spoken in parts of Brazil such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having war@@ med up in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ endants other cultures , revealing other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site still want to publish more of these &quot; uns@@ ur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; who are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to download their favourite sw@@ ells here .

how Sri Lanka per@@ ished with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood @-@ water and cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon that usually ends at the end of May , by strong rain falls , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka , 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people were missing due to the flood and Schl@@ amm@@ uni@@ winds .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people were transferred to 30@@ 4 secure residence .
the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the sho@@ ots in some areas were slowly coming back .
health and hygiene affairs of the population are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following photos and videos give an impression of the amount of the cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates on the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lan@@ kan deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue crisis , warns the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
today the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the high water , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle likewise flooded due to the yesterday flooded water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has five planes for rescue operations and another five are made for transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their flooded villages .
even various organizations and start @-@ ups have been prepared to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ar in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water and humanitarian assistance in Sri Lanka .
if any search and li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ys d@@ ron@@ es require for their sur@@ geries , please call the number 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want dry foods and life @-@ necessary goods for flood @-@ offering goods -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 7@@ 7@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their sit@@ ing data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ sturb@@ ating Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood @-@ help &quot; button , which allowed it to call users to re@@ charge a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted free to the Sri Lan@@ kan Red Cross .
they also conducted an &quot; SOS &quot; button which pushed forward more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat transactions for flood @-@ water and lands@@ li@@ ds .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , they bring residents in need in need and help assistance .
this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now ahead of the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .
Muslims who cannot see it
the Women &apos;s March is on January 21st , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I trusted her four year old daughter to trust her children ; she is my rock in the Brand@@ ing .
for a minute we are still calling for par@@ oles for women &apos;s rights .
in the next cross , we are right for trans@@ gender .
we are located in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and men , some keep the iconic image of a woman with he@@ ather high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask myself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I am working or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their conception .
you are aston@@ ished me .
there are 1.@@ 7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all of them equal .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim @-@ dra@@ wer .
these dra@@ wer is so well designed in our collective imagination that once Muslims , the same as I do not fit into it , be ex@@ propri@@ ated .
deto@@ xi@@ zed
I am not alone with this .
this is even done to poet whose poetry is best sold in America : Rum@@ i .
which images do you come in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day he died , the centre of his poetry .
but in the western concept the religion was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a big part of the history of 1,@@ 7 billion Muslims from this world .
another consists of the reduced image of Muslims , by western books for centuries @-@ colonial .
this entic@@ ing picture language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the Norwegian Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid was breaking the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise further today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ban them .
I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ groups .
this Nar@@ r@@ v o@@ vers@@ had@@ ows a reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this Nar@@ r@@ v failed to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are killed in public buildings and Saudi Arabia , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which both are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken to American soil from Afri@@ kan@@ ers that were brought to slavery .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
this Nar@@ r@@ v has staff@@ ed our collective imagination as deep and error @-@ minded that often Si@@ kh Men and Children are becoming the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ised attacks and ra@@ ids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and about the way we tell them is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but is fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
belong to the 1,@@ 7 billion
in the news industry , we do more than just stories to tell about facts based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to grasp the Nar@@ r@@ v of 1.@@ 7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed to place here where seven million Muslims form the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants from the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
approved .
four decades ago , my migr@@ ated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue before and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers have been made by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan had re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ f@@ aded Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ f@@ aded Muslim and American ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , if people wonder why I am not a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or take my hand@@ some pocket cord , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for respect from Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all pick@@ pockets with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must also not be the@@ ological expert to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or almost always be selected for extra security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight widely spread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ led Islam@@ hostile asset with money , Thin@@ k @-@ tanks and experts for false information , which is already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , is Islam@@ ophobia in more than just a stranger who stri@@ ps a woman &apos;s head .
or as the start@@ ling card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the entire USA , see below .
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ophobia in its ugly forms takes up our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer .
the author in 1986 on a photo of their children &apos;s gart@@ ner group .
approved .
I want to explain this .
I was born as Muslim but was born to be Muslim but was born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York .
if social nutri@@ tion@@ ists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my mus@@ li@@ ous faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there .
maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my rock in the Brand@@ ing see that I am Muslim when they could look through the 15 feet concrete and air which separate our houses .
it would see the cr@@ end@@ ous ritual with my daughter when I swe@@ pt them into my arms and put the Arab verses for the protection of the Quran that are inv@@ oked the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat each of them three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith is perhaps not always visible , but my Muslim adher@@ ence is always part of my shadow .
the grandmother of the author , when she wins a I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters at some time in the 1960s .
approved .
belonging to my grandmother &apos;s mother with her sisters , as she has decades to win a competition of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the image of it that I can see at this moment when I slept my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings , Su@@ fi saint and a cor@@ ans with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that they can virtually ni@@ ble .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers they had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a nation , which has been created for centuries - through a &quot; Empire &quot; , founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Comp@@ anie , it has a deep meaning to call God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
approved .
belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my assigned grandfather is crying .
inter@@ na@@ ec@@ rin , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of Kash@@ mir , wept N@@ ana J@@ aan , to f@@ aded his family in India from India , who he was not allowed to close in his arms in half a century .
belonging to know is that there are millions Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as in my grandfather , have been torn apart from coloni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world at risk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans are all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last two centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was rejected a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , Kash@@ mir@@ ic sub@@ jection of British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; since he led the first mosque in England .
even before flying planes he jour@@ ne@@ yed into more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of the 1,@@ 7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable families ; our un@@ settled history .
it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , who were disper@@ sed in Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means to know that the suici@@ de rate has risen since 2001 by more than 32 percent .
it means to know that when a tragedy the USA is looking for and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name that will report four times more than a story with a white attack .
it means to know that four @-@ hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liber@@ ated black slaves with the name Bil@@ al .
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ensla@@ ved and brought to that country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X to a American hero .
it is the heat that I sen@@ sed when people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a Kash@@ mir , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple ties , but to fail to communicate them to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Nar@@ r@@ v of the 1.@@ 7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cu@@ be , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble branch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother to care for my child and all the Muslim children , knowing that powerless and privileged people are established on this branch of structural enemies .
structural Islam@@ ophobia is in the Muslim registr@@ ars , which began President Bush and led to President Obama .
it consists in consistent monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration officer , which takes a five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it consists in a country that includes its limits to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list , &quot; which largely derives Arabs and Muslims in the sight .
it is the wars we lead and the bombs which we throw on Muslim countries .
because of the stories we tell and to those who we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , the scientists of North@@ western University showed an academic image and b@@ ate them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 with regard to evolution .
Muslims received the sligh@@ test score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations , which we must lead
we are too deeply dar@@ ed to form@@ ulate the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous imaging prints , which we engage in our news editorial office .
at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our often @-@ awaited identities and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Some@@ thing , S@@ ay Some@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ ie ; the vir@@ gin@@ al Vide@@ os@@ erie of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
take screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of muscular @-@ American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.@@ 7 billion .
there is one reason for the conspir@@ atorial theore@@ ti@@ cians , that existed in the dark corners of the Internet now , now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown exp@@ on@@ entially because they did not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ entially by adding the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier it had not been given it ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and history , which I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter now , but who today made me to a re@@ bound Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ s@@ umen@@ ical track in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , a story might be , where someone is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , there are contexts in the context of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are not terms with whom we usually throw in our schools or read them in our newspapers .
poster the fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of the Islam@@ ist Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in public performance , four decades ago was a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we need to raise ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to bol@@ ster the &apos; other &apos; because the employment we have had a new future in which we did not have a president who bom@@ bed chocolate cake , while he has already captured countries and &quot; to other &quot; people being bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,@@ 7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
stories of stories , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility , here and now despite a language barrier to get in touch with someone ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) the proceeds of stories in their original language is a possible answer to that .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ translated blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the one hand , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities .
in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin exists in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has already performed events for 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the Pre@@ acher of the project the following applies :
the mass man@@ nequ@@ in of languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , reflecting Di@@ versity - safe spaces where inhabitants don &apos;t have to forget who they are to be part of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen is often associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hear these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to appreciate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to feel , to feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers put their story first and translated into their own language and then explain it in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their dedication and their presentation lead to the audience .
they call laugh and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou are also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of stor@@ y@@ art for their land .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the har@@ es and P@@ avian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after he explains the meaning of his plot , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness :
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
you were completely with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ eller .
Puerto Rico demands a re@@ frac@@ ture of the sovereign debt from the USA
with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which attended to 72 million US dollars , participated in the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organizations participated in a mass rally ; the march started at the pu@@ er@@ tori@@ an Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was called by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano por la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da ( with the neur@@ on of debt ) and the Ö@@ kom@@ en@@ sic church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the inter@@ c@@ essors of the reform of debt have also submitted an petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , bankers and government agencies responsible for debt should be held accountable for their corrupt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for a financial review and a committee committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy .
we will pres@@ pres@@ st and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not their .
we will not choose between education and health .
our Rent@@ als will not find themselves with decl@@ ining retirement payments .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the country @-@ integrated territory of the US - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party integration with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on public responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state @-@ view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a broad restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imposed on the outside , without participation and conviction of the citizens shall run at risk , be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration brought the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been incar@@ cer@@ ated since March 15 , 2012 in Syria .
his name was painted out of the directory of the A@@ dra prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information on its current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide ?
what did we give up in this process of temporary convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention on Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; was taken on the basis of a &quot; strict secret &quot; command of military judgment from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as In@@ sider of the Assad &apos;s government and made them knowledge of the alleged death event against her husband .
his place of residence and state remain unknown .
a pioneer in the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in extending access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , technical officer and at the moment passed the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project , which founded the Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ er cultural prototypes are pres@@ cient as the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins Pal@@ my@@ ras virtu@@ ell .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites of the world , was the cross @-@ crossing of numerous civilizations and f@@ using Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would ign@@ ite all this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this strike into digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time @-@ capsule that will be invaluable to the public , as well as scientists and artists in the future .
as a result , Bas@@ sel has not yet been able to complete this project yet .
N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English in English , even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read and speak English well .
he always shared his knowledge with each one who asked . he has taught other detention , to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet at .
he also included other detention , as they use computers , at least theoretically , without them having actually kept one in their hands .
G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ verb , which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 as he was in custody .
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book a year .
she s@@ mug@@ gling the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from the Arabic to English .
the book is lic@@ ant @-@ free .
book envelope by Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is done &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes place during each visit ,
that I have failed in the world of your charming eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment in which we embrace ourselves
that each of the dangers not matter .
everyone of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and gu@@ ardian
I forget the afflic@@ tions of the prison
and I go to every detail of your voice and words
I wear with passion for me ,
when your eyes have to say well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness ,
to get all the moments back ,
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
a year passes , my soul
during the summer time
I am in your cage ,
and you are still in the cage of monsters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ tion History is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people .
those who were arrested or killed by the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
until 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 .
the stories of many other people are unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community have been calling for release of the Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mos@@ ambique : because of corruption repression , after the release from prison
Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption by turning a government member after half of his sentence to work in the state apparatus , where corruption was committed .
this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants in 2010 .
the money came from public funds from the Mos@@ ambique airports , whose council Cam@@ ba@@ za was standing between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately demanded his re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement to the company , which happened on April 19 , then .
in accordance with an opinion of the General Manager of the Republic , which indicated the request , there would be no obstacles to refer to Cam@@ ba@@ za , again its old post as the company was not a lack of discipline after his detention .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t have the action well .
the Centre for Public Transportation ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director back :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have entered a lack of discipline against the infringement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the firm seems to be effective however and does not establish appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in E@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ ambi@@ an social media , this behavior also re@@ jects and considers the case as a &quot; reluc@@ t@@ ance &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be advis@@ er after he was sentenced to a sentence and that half of them were lowered .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and commit his image .
but since it is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be integrated into the company , which he helped to cause damage .
therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
reluc@@ tant !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of no morality :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he offen@@ ded it I can not believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already ri@@ pped the state already so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but rather has only served itself by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source , and the state itself became tired of the man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief belongs to the prison :
th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as a first independent president for ever , but also as a shar@@ per , tri@@ bution , and - side by side , prophe@@ tic speakers .
one of his most famous oral portra@@ y@@ als was , when he acknowledged that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of everything , including Fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambition , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . it changes the tactics , but it does not turn its ambitions .
a ambitious person is a criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also declined :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for ten years and came free .
and today it sets out the company , at which he de@@ generates money ; again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ δ@@ ι@@ κ@@ ό . ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means ki@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or sp@@ il@@ age .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the popular social network took their post@@ ings out of the web , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although on the origin of the word still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin , or generally used as ad@@ jective . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of har@@ ass@@ ation in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements of the word has given an extremely ab@@ om@@ ous con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word which mostly uses ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Burma .
but in an effort to fight H@@ ass@@ works in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically forth .
the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use of use have been cens@@ ored .
furthermore there are several s@@ mes@@ ic words with the different mean@@ ings that have the same character as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair is written to Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( camel ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ out A@@ ung Ka@@ ung explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was today deleted , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however he had asked his friends in a spiritual way , if she knew how he could soo@@ the his back pain by doing a word play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) on Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ age is the opinion that they need to be more radical nation@@ alists , but she also stressed that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it del@@ etes all posts that are in suspi@@ cion to spread racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on fac@@ ebook .
what it should do instead is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( alter@@ nat@@ s ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good is that these three @-@ legged nation@@ alists will spread the har@@ ass@@ ation , a rather good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail its nationalism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all , dissemin@@ ating the language , the efficiency of this strategy doesn &apos;t hold long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ or@@ ship of keywords will often begin a cap and mouse game , whereby users use social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative writing of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post@@ ings , as he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; Facebook Community standards did not fail . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts from people that have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate @-@ talk radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism are poor in the country .
Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ical Internet community for advice :
Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen racism in Burma due to their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words to cens@@ or will only bring more hatred within the different communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throne &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her@@ edi@@ curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they don &apos;t tried to correct the mis@@ er@@ ased post@@ ings .
if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million health benefits they had a great deal , it would be great .
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ or@@ ship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery under users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now about Facebook funny and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate language to see if their post@@ ings are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook @-@ posts that were not contained yet , but still removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ical lyrics reads , &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch builder and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook is the post office that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
the post stating &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used to use social networks to expand their voices and their influence .
among other things , vulner@@ abilities in social networks shall have to settle violence in Burma in addition , especially in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed for its failure , the ex@@ cre@@ eping hate speeches on his bur@@ ial pages under control .
but instead of simply put the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; it would have better running , rather than looked at context rather than on code focus initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tobago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the marriage @-@ marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago .
on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament &apos;s parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law which aims to ban this practice , so that the old age of 18 is now at 18 .
before this change of the marriage , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a large public out@@ cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country gather that the state does not interfere with , since that , age is not the maturity . &quot;
this happened in spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN &apos;s rights invention , the min@@ ors of min@@ ors , for each person under the age of 18 .
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago , and with 18 were 8,@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 the statistical summary of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys in 19 were married .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements who were endeav@@ our@@ ing to create laws to pa@@ h , followed at the bottom , and grati@@ fy great support . undoubtedly they helped to bring this outcome .
nevertheless , it did not go smoothly .
a Hind@@ u leader , Z. B. had no concerns , the critic@@ isms of the pa@@ h , they should , have do@@ omed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition sought tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent which contained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just the president of the country must agree and pre@@ ach the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave us a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram has posted :
Mr Senator Clar@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was held in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes against it and not on the other hand .
once he was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of the social media user was thrilled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage have been changed .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who was a minister in the ministry of education , said :
it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed to wear the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that is almost every cost worth it .
while A@@ bel Jackson of mind was , it was definitely long enough to create the practice , Lara Qu@@ entri@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come :
public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent news !
the law has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 on it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ly Mut@@ ota , which belonged to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is , noted :
the delicate age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious community of 18 years .
the draft to the amendment of the German Law was announced today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all Members who were against have voted for the law .
marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ ren@@ rot .
many thanks to all activists who have received him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organisation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ahead of months Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to redeem his promises now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the General State prosec@@ utor Paris Al ra@@ wi , a champi@@ ons of the law , argued that if Mahar@@ aj would apply against the law , most social media users would wish to tackle the debate on the subject in a different way .
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion so general , in a way that only panic and dis@@ grace would be able to speak , that the state , our daughters from before , that they may possibly be ab@@ used to carry out die discussion , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you believe it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s deer are legal or remains the norm even though there are laws which they say .

by the mir@@ rors of web pages , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content
the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia @-@ page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the US , internationally .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over one month Turkey has now blocked Turkey the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Commons .
day by day becomes clearer , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information to find and share .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series reb@@ elling against the block .
although many techn@@ ologic Internet users are used to use byp@@ assing tools for blocking websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date articles from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN Pre@@ val@@ ence of the World ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
while Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society on Harvard University , find regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act was adopted ( No. 56@@ 51 ) .
to China , Turkey is the largest country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ or@@ ship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains closed , there are several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( thus computer machines ) , which does not base itself on the system of domain name and thus making a complete cens@@ or@@ ship .
the content is available despite legal prohibition however .
in a blo@@ g@@ post we report IP@@ FS about his efforts :
after we heard the news ( about the block@@ age of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to cover sn@@ ap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed way .
this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if you cannot reach the website www.@@ wikipedia.org .
IP@@ FS was also involved that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation and it &apos;s just about screen@@ shots and no li@@ ve@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror page of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open @-@ source project that anyone can use to host similar skin sites if in the respective country is locked in Wikipedia .

you attack on a different URL that is not the original one . that which one can then see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ page so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia , then when it is locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ alese game photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation .

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
with permission used .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours .
the motiv@@ ator even to wear a camera to himself and try to straigh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar has endeav@@ ored to bring herself to the international scene at the age of 28 .
and his hometown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook , like him this prime location in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers ! !
I looked at home just at home when suddenly called Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a leop@@ ard was a leop@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river , where the leop@@ ard was and I immediately started to kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to co @-@ operation with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know it , for he rose tigers already from face to face :
a tiger can &apos;t be bother@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep by the sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping @-@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ kowski appeared . he immediately sets up , we look at and he s@@ rt me through the Sal trees ! !

this entry was written by Kay@@ ona az A@@ ci@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India .
an revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing Convention .
in many parts of India women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h women give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should pay the norm to keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a hill and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives by name .
the tradition their wives also do not call on name , is also common among men . however , they have much less re@@ plac@@ ements to fear , if at all , what , should they not occur in this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , came nine women , including health guards as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main theme theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
being one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is committed to the reduction of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with the help of her video camera in the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ In@@ infected , and manages these clubs .
it reports on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change at the same time .
the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , were women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands under the name .
she decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
to speak out the name of their hus@@ bands out , is a Br@@ it , which they maintain all the du@@ ti@@ fully and never asked into question .
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him long life .
a woman who does not ein@@ holding this is deemed to be depos@@ ited , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of that discussion .
at the beginning of the Roh@@ ini , who previously wanted her husband to never be named with the name , try at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stopped for a long time after the video was at an end .
Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in his luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion of discussion .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , mainly girls and women were protected .
at the beginning of the lap Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after video @-@ projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , upset , sad , affection@@ ate and so forth .
then she asked , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want it means they do not respect us ?
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the bra@@ king of a century @-@ old tradition , in which married women never allowed the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she had just ki@@ cked her during the whole practice , and she decided to let him out all the an@@ ed frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him .
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in ad@@ renalin rush to have broken with an age @-@ old bread , the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their hus@@ bands on behalf .
and they kept their say .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini was given a multitude of reports .
the husband of a wife called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name .
a different club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she was soli@@ di@@ fied , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation returned to violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the dip @-@ red point on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus :
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot if he was doing so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lau@@ ghed only , and I listened to carrying him .
the other women did not quit completely with it , but mean they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women the disc@@ us@@ sion@@ lu@@ b is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make an excursion during each discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and hung up and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have said about some things , for example like our identities on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest .
it feels great to say certain things noisy , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only been at Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most of them that is okay , but some have wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt over a pants , they did not believe .
after a lot of arguments and discussion about the merits of your own clothes @-@ choice , morality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mug@@ gled Roh@@ ini their own pair of cures ( upper hem@@ den ) in a panel discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next , they have now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is certain that they will manage it .
on the question whether the five months have changed something in the five months since their first discussion circuit , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things are slowly coming into the roles :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then listened again to the name of their hus@@ bands .
some , including me , do it yet , but only when they are alone and are not members of family members .
only one or two remains the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry on at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the disc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the we@@ dge to gain more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating the navig@@ ating river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club does each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman comes home in the club and tell other people about what we talk and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan @-@ visit of the popular band The Beatles is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beatles in their landing in Japan .
scre@@ enshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag in the US market was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans were re@@ plac@@ ements and their appreciation to the Beatles .
the visit to the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was interviewed exclusively in London in 1964 , on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this has enough to shoot the Japanese .
the people here turned out quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ ola Asian Review .
good morning ! ! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan . in the case of 51 years ago they were in Tokyo .
even today songs of the Beatles also sang in Japanese car@@ aoke bars and in English teaching at Japanese central schools .
the Beatles of the Beatles also survived everything .
today is The Beatles Day .
we all love in our house the Beatles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should represent John Len@@ non or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places that are related to the band .
in fact , when you love the Beatles , these are your 5 places that you must visit absolutely .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) Pen@@ ny Lane
5 ) ( V@@ om Link ) The Beatles Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le enough :
good morning together .
today is The Beatles Day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year too .
and of course , a number of companies are also using the Fan@@ als , like this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen , Japanese no@@ od@@ les are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could it be for one day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to Y@@ E@@ STER@@ DA@@ Y today today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les for Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the day is going to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;

at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs have been removed .
two men were arrested and in the episode they stood , that the organs of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi are used .

it is the first time that successive attacks on smooth @-@ member men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the purpose of murder for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN in the South African country introduced a mission to investigate these intern@@ ships .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the fall of the incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital due to liver cancer .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state of citizenship ) after launching a manifes@@ to on democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us Fall as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a speaker he did not require to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , fre@@ eing or to allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely out of the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June , to discuss the fall of Li@@ u .
a spokes@@ person , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Li@@ u abroad for a treatment .
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Bren@@ da have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
the relationship between China and Norway was exhausted after the Nobel Peace Prize , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government assumed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were continued until in December last year . only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the race and went back to China , since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
having shared the message that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel Committee brought its hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick its price in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was not able to counter its price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on July 6th the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission President , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , China called for the release of Li@@ us on June 30 , 2012 : &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , we expect China to all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they are meant to meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in this respect he might help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary , Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27th , that the message demanded the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy sent an angry answer from China to himself , with the exterior of the State Department , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and have ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should provide the married couple :
protection and liberty , such as travel to liberty and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system , as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to impose the Chinese government on pushing Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I call on China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he has known for proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received all the medical support he needed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 , in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing report the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed the visit to Hamburg .
Canada
on June 28th , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um , asked China to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to move from his family .
Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells us on :
Canada calls for China to safeguard its international human rights obligations , including free speech , to uph@@ old and liber@@ ate the exercise of these rights .
France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry requested China on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will get all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . additionally his wife and his family can have contact with him .
although the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will receive him in the end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan
the Council of the land@@ affairs in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and pose a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese Law@@ gi@@ ers Yu me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to treat themselves in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself very concerned in a statement on June 28th around Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished , to a harmonious , more stable and wealthy China could have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 marked , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be considered as a city .
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international law of the law firm in the State of New York , the Minister of State , that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore , since Singapore compared with other countries .
he is supporting Singapore as a city should be seen .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the judiciary , &quot; the logic to twist , &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercising of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ing to create this valuable country , you hear that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the impression of a flight before the responsibilities , a mandatory breach .
Singapore , if you are not my country , Wh@@ ose country is it then ?
the reasons given by Shan@@ mu@@ gam trials were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of its , it appeared inevitably un@@ democratic .
however , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently conducted by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once one reaches the core point of the theme , the good old ly@@ re @-@ keepers of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be the Democrats , and abandoned its tw@@ isted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the final week , the answers to his American guests were given answers to their American guests regarding our press , the judiciary , our political system really non @-@ responses .
corresponding questions were asked with non @-@ answers rational ways .
Rachel Z@@ eng promotes Shan@@ mu@@ gam to show his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so in which country is part of our city ...
in short , I understand nothing .
I would be very grateful if our cheaper K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to resolve this point , if it was paid high to be part of the city &apos;s government .
by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the reviews that one should begin to understand the entire co @-@ ordin@@ ance of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ gam could be better understood , according to which Singapore was a city and no country .
read the ins@@ cription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , why the elections in Singapore were so un@@ equi@@ vocal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he met Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities did a party win for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously does not meant it in that sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who acts as a leader of a growing generation , a polem@@ ical statement .
I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said , very much ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which awaits me - whether I disagree with them or not , but that is another thing .
but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review spl@@ itting the weaknesses of Shan@@ mug@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; beg@@ ged an error &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he plays an important role within the cabinet office , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the Singapore offer their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ?
who must pay the prime minister to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel roll@@ out ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ y@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and was always a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this set seems to have angry many hum@@ orous things ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defending the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak about the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices expressed his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your hometown or homeland ?
your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question that is placed in Japan most is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live towards and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ ors by asking personal questions .
on my clear position then the default response follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook war@@ dly against anger , if they are kept for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me .
for someone who does not know , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans get a Canadian banner openly with their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
so it was already , when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small a@@ hor@@ n@@ blades at their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there are no weapons !
gender @-@ sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is supposedly considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends , which I really admire .
it wouldn &apos;t make a difference to me if one would conf@@ use me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
firstly : being called &quot; nice , &quot; in essence , to be mir@@ r@@ ently - as is the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but portable , un@@ important figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
there are no corners and edges , nothing that you can encounter .
be harmless , in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
that can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things around one around .
I would even go far , to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to deal with our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness I want to join with my American friends .
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au came the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada even sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
one in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ odi@@ zes , which took the power in 2014 and , in spite of their ple@@ dge the civil government , the country continues to uph@@ old the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which rules his girlfriend .
although not expressly political , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
within the first three days this was shared on Facebook up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 pieces .
last month even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to look at this video .
you can interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , especially about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
look at the videos of the video on some of the political issues that pers@@ ists in Thailand for the past three years .
the &quot; 44 &quot; rules of the girls &quot; may possibly refer to the dra@@ kon@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which is given to the commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ ger , absolute decision @-@ making on important national issues .
the 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are considered by the jun@@ ta as critics .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , its v@@ ague and un@@ clear regulations are often used by the authorities in order to susp@@ end activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also established in the army , which monitors on the online content and individuals , to whom the monarchy is sl@@ ander@@ ed to have been prosec@@ uted .
Thailand is putting a stick set against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ est@@ ä@@ ts@@ ins@@ ult ) by .
on 20 May 2014 , the war law was declared in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems pursued by the Jun@@ ta is their decision to buy expensive U boats , although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers .
in the video even shown how people will be thrown into a black van before they bring it into a detention centre , another problem .
some journalists are in prison , because it supposedly causes &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long sti@@ pen@@ alties , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song of the band showing the Sal@@ ut off &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; im@@ it@@ ated that was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protest in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in the eastern Caprivi Region :

the following article , written by Dmit@@ ry Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Georgian @-@ Eur@@ asi@@ an War was officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic .
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ sp@@ arch@@ al show marked pictures .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chi@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , shut@@ ters , Geor@@ gi@@ vers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to so@@ jour@@ ned in the region .
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and wast@@ e@@ ases are living in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities .
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ sp@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the 16@@ ,000 people has risen since 2011 , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story dwell@@ ings of the Soviet Union from the early 60s to be called the Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ tal chim@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are falling and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance to the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it &apos;s hard to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gartens that ministered to all of the community .
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable splend@@ or buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district in the meantime .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ ka , which are still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately retreat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us taking photos , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply has forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers their girlfriend something to and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ sp@@ arch@@ er@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the subs@@ istence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , bee@@ keeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
the district government provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build In@@ cch@@ ini ... &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman went out with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave front @-@ Asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ sia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina wants to accept no financial aid from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas monthly instal@@ ments are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you do not have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a tells you that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit us .
but we cannot do this ever - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
as she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; calls aun@@ t G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ cch@@ ini .
I already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build up zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as spokes@@ person Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds themselves of the thorns in front of the war .
despite the relatives , that live in the Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ asien broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we have recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ al@@ stadt in Ab@@ ch@@ sia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still be a little longer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
her husband is working in coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
in the vicinity of the house where Nat@@ az@@ as kinder@@ garten once found , they keep pigs , cows , che@@ ek and chickens .
it tells us that it was a very scary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I remember the same day as the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as our conversation end up , a little boy goes over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hiding .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ts him behind .
he plays with the ball , who then down the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the deserted buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood who care for nonsense in their lives .
you do not know it different .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by Amy Br@@ ack@@ et was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I@@ .org and will be published with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 5@@ 9@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ er , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink Bri@@ ll@@ en@@ roll@@ el and gol@@ d@@ colored ear rings in Te@@ ddy Be@@ ars .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name M@@ um Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 dollars a night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bled walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ cian immigrants arrive here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept on cart@@ on .
she wants to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications they cannot pay , they masks them with a bal@@ m the exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , is arrived in a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama is a fair nickname for Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ción Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ inging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yeah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reply with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao also travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have been living in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move toward the north .
the family had heard of other way@@ els from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; said Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that the Hai@@ tian and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans were already talking to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et worked in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he has started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will contact Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests will often send text messages to her when they go away or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explained that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have brought her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ ks hope for the migrants who travel through wallpaper .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ ça .
during this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family were taken in their small house .
it is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the buses to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
he began to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian .
some sleep at ceilings on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a hob outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests go through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid .
the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled from him money in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to comp@@ ose of him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a solo attraction , has offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and they try to decide where the next steps should go .
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses consult the travelers quiet their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone away .
as a proud grandmother she hat@@ ched in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ care that her has made her to her , some photos of her grand@@ kids and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sad , while she puts her briefly to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; repeated it every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a monitoring app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang , from Twitter users , in order to establish the &apos; 2000 &apos; degree &apos; .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , a ethnic minorities region in Western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 the mobile phones at Tian@@ shan District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone call in which it indicates the district government to install an surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but C@@ ò@@ n@@ aires will use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ chat group .
in the communication of the police , that the App may determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is the block@@ ages of por@@ no@@ graphy , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network .
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers allow to manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ aling from it .
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ or@@ ship in China focus mainly on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often darker for those working in remote , printed ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict @-@ areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ in@@ ven@@ ous Internet down@@ circuits .
the media @-@ based media outlets &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( known in the US ) , the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where the police ed the in@@ discrimin@@ ate on whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile phone call required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the day .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ product description , from which the software can lift the passwords request of a Windows operating system , and thus full access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computer and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party , to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents .
all government offices , authorities and the associated facilities including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office using their computers and communication devices .
an up @-@ to @-@ date report of Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi and to the 1st August its &quot; personal ID card , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; register at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist &quot; videos , &quot; but this action does not hurt the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and give them pen@@ alties for a whole host of other possible rewards , including those that refer to peaceful religious or political communications .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad al J@@ il@@ ane attributed his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far away from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar firmly that you &apos;re alone in a place where everything has disappeared .
everything has gradually been dissolved and a truth reveals that which is clearly visible from both inside and outside .
one that makes her name all glory .
one that has depres@@ sed itself in a list of feelings and expressions , who do not allow Met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when you get into reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scen@@ eries and the performer - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and far cry after death .
all doubts resolved in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is moving on the axis of the disaster . you &apos;ll realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone around stone .
they have kept me and my father three times , but that was not yet enough for me to be &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the head of the security services it formulated - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he introduced his power over us by giving even the simplest concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protest such as wee@@ ds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
it was enough to make the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
all the districts sought after , only my own .
for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ is@@ eless , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that is up to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ce .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
I broke through the still@@ ness by taking several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house Shel@@ ter .
I hear@@ ken@@ ed to my voice through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we sat down to a beautiful image that filled my expectations entirely and entirely fulfilled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in such a moment you are aware that you are free to the Spirit from the Lam@@ p but is simply not interested in ease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low it - nothing can give you back your voice , after you depos@@ ited it all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I came there .
the Ober@@ st G@@ assan stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ st G@@ assan begins to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear , as you cry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his h@@ asser@@ s eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you know really what to look into the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity ; perhaps at the revolution .
I was so sure of my job as I answered , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
and I think I never ceased to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret my word from what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father right away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stu@@ d of this con@@ flu@@ ent set is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; an emotional torture , which I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ ened the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
then again through the yard and into the second office that leads through a course to the single cells .
I pre@@ ach all details exactly before I ordered the room .
otherwise than usual , they have probably assigned to me a larger cell .
I have to share it with just one more prisoner and allowed me to sit immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I attack on a long @-@ proven communication method : with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ de @-@ comra@@ de was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first prisoner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he rep@@ lied to me finally .
apparently in no one of the surrounding cells was a respected man middle aged that looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness there can be no distinctive fac@@ ades , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers may be its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will immediately hear .
the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would free him if I stay .
Li@@ ar .
I &apos;d like to have a bird @-@ shy to exp@@ el all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be at about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around those time tones the scre@@ ams , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of ruin , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the gray in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &apos; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) .
&quot; you are here to be heard . &quot;
thus , the secret was clear : to protect the security of us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tical dialect - so they played their con@@ sec@@ t@@ arian creation card and cleared the close attention of their world view .
this is not a house that is here is not a country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ existence to transform the criminals of her clan into a hero .
I ordered the audi@@ ble and tre@@ ad on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so .
it starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions , who em@@ ailed him , &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you join this dew and protest to demonstrations that will soon find an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I used it to answer , not to answer .
I can really no longer say exactly when ins@@ ults and pun@@ ches have become a friendly conversation for me at an ordinary communication instrument .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to it , even though I did nothing to earn this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at punishment in all its variety .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the affection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube , which is probably taken out of the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er came up with your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot hold your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cry was not enough for him , and why they were ex@@ chan@@ ted by a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during my first withdrawal I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked for earlier than trash cans , or if that belonged to normal working equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a giant cable .
within one single hour three of them differ , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling , and found no favour in it , which is why he applied to an electric truck .
flow through my whole body , enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
my semi @-@ supp@@ er body that lay down on the ground was the perfect power leader .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back there .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been at midnight .
I decided to put myself sleeping again ; let &apos;s say this was my only option .
some hours went out , which came to me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning meets the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I rep@@ lied with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must make fear@@ ful worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and bound you , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
the General R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ kes to his canvas , sometimes to his computer , and again and again to his couch .
but to what people can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine watering lips .
he lives on the top of his family house , which had been part of them since 1967 ; the year that Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( approximately : Farmer ) .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who watches the conservative majority and analysed her well @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian Arabs , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ativity , but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria are rich according to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b when someone who isn &apos;t limited by boundaries in his thinking and he can suffer from its own statement with the people who suffer under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not open it openly , he puts a particular a@@ version against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not think about my own life circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then he adds : &quot; I think this is because I am a man &quot; while being sh@@ re@@ ated in water Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; at this time , it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the former law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramad@@ an .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking down with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hot young Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the dose of warm coffee and the wa@@ wa@@ ders of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette is primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid fundamental things - as in the public during Ramad@@ an water to drink water - in order to land not in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens has canc@@ eled a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time .
some parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic State &apos;s Front - the j@@ ord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradic@@ tory and the main reason for the concert statement .
the MP and former press secretary of the Islamic Coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many believe that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism that question the old @-@ approved legitimacy author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which continues to stand for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this statement probably should not be easy to grasp rh@@ et@@ oric , but indeed an ever more evident cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s traditional Gender Standards on Lei@@ be following his vision formed by the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the image shows the skel@@ eton of a apparently low @-@ comfor@@ ting unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red sea ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust .
in the past few years , Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders &quot; - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary mur@@ ders in 2016 reached its peak ; however , that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women , victims , victims or domestic violence .
according to a law on break@@ able control from 1954 , women , who are exposed to risk of internal @-@ family violence , &quot; at an un@@ certain time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort , as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is needed that the wife is nothing to happen .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to do not shy away themes that go long in his country as a tab@@ u .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically explosive , however , that he is his music , the full of explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot separate from politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Near East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was tri@@ pled in politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lies the focus on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can continue to lead .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get , in his words , &quot; which one wants , &quot; whether it is faith or non @-@ believe , hetero@@ sexual , or homo@@ sexuality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were to be deeply cens@@ ored up in 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular Prime Minister Ro@@ ya , to remember later that his comments were torn from the context , and that his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but there was only a revised version , &quot; he says .
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b promotes the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam .
he mentioned Abu Nu@@ da , a poet of the eighth century , which has remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ da , who would then work on behalf of the calibr@@ ation , in the eighth century could write openly about homo@@ sexuality , why can Jord@@ an@@ ier do not this ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
even recently , in January 2017 , the Norwegian news service took a number of former government @-@ ordered and members of the teacher association , with the reason why they expressed themselves cri@@ tically on comments in social media to the problems that are deeply rooted in the country with deeply rooted corruption .
in the face of this the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to that , only the tip of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ anian approach .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has dri@@ lled M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it looks from slow , printed and internal changes . he is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society .
finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he dre@@ aming not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will be inspired by music , art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs , round and artificial democracies . at least he hopes that .
until it has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and consequently resist .
this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which is belonged to the A@@ man as Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant Warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is thought that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory means that the forti@@ tude , the drums and the dancing over more than one thousand years were handed over , in the armies of the west of Japan in the northeast mar@@ ched to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could pick up a few great seats , so we have a great view .
you can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a communal center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for a Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two festive cars are just visible .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high sea level was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !

rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this story , as they help promote the Peruvian youth from the crime and promote an legitimate profession like the bar@@ ber .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s main port , located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate where road ro@@ b and illegal drugs work are daily .
a survey conducted in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel secure .
at the same time Peru - how many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Peru ) , has led to become more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can form these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity even has inspired an annual event , the competition of hair sty@@ ling your &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which is taking place since 2014 .
there experts take each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy who found themselves in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to get young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice to obtain an education in hair@@ dressing materials , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the dozens of opportunities have seen dozens of young people that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training courses in March and reported on some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district of which we are very proud , because from love to children , we have built this educational community .
Colombia : notes to guer@@ rilla warfare
photo : Valentina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the version of the Beit@@ rags &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commandment in guer@@ rilla warfare &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love notes to people that we know ?
is it not yet much more important to accomo@@ date people who are coming down , affection ?
precisely this question went to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as por la Re@@ s@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , young people to write letters to guer@@ rilla warfare .
only recently , her country was show@@ room of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces Colom@@ bian ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
international was considered the signing of the peace contract as such important that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos had received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ ers that lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and carried out around the clock their weapons in themselves , they must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian can join together and would have to help the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love @-@ ships in former guer@@ rilla struggles to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ rilla warfare - which should then be passed personally .
the val@@ entine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we love the people we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love notes , but those who forget that they need much unnecessary .
he plans , he told to share his love with people this year , which were most pressing .
thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot;
so far , more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign .
the initiative is present in all major cities in Colom@@ bian such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogotá .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 at one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ a , to transfer the letters personally .
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done before to counter the commands of their leaders .
but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but letters full of under@@ mining people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; said the Political Scienti@@ s@@ student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the govern@@ ors of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after we passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa @-@ fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ rilla war ) saw , I saw a guer@@ rilla war that wrote something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of responding , because next to him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ Gran@@ at@@ designer , a deadly weapon in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sle@@ eping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I said to him nevertheless , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered a letter I wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
never in my life someone has written something like this , so I responded to it . &quot; I suddenly walked the tears about the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him very firm and placed me next to the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates .
perhaps he was sorry to be the war , and was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighters , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life than war . he never had to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger . &quot; I never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society where you are waiting for us with open arms .
so far I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
firstly , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together at a panel discussion .
the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already involved in the dark .
therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice from state to the whole Colom@@ bian people had experienced . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more righteous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard before , and had no electoral law , and to recognize that people , whom I have often seen as a monster and even had learned , even people with beautiful feelings were turned around , which were surrounded by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country is living , hur@@ ts me .
but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to teach us something and give a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander at the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied , that after dra@@ ining peace would reign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take arms and protest for their rights . and this is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy of no weapons .
that is why we call all def@@ ender of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology , they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homo@@ sexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region are subjected to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists in the last few months have witnessed the persecution of gay men in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but the threat , which is like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ u@@ ction above the village called T@@ Q @-@ commune , has not been written only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman of Gros@@ ny , who shared with us some of their experiences and talked to us about what has currently happened in the Republic .
the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya has conquered the international headlines from several months ago , after reports have been published , which themati@@ zed the disp@@ ens@@ ation , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gas@@ eta ; it cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and they in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; you have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
Sabrina , a wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
even since her childhood she felt that she was really a woman .
when she was grown up she became aware that Che@@ chn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Che@@ chn@@ ya had experienced her coun@@ ties , the hunt was opened to Sabrina .
she was afraid of fear for her life in the United States .
Sabrina : I was a volunteer hero@@ in for a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife who put into trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the internet , using my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chn@@ ya friends , using the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ chn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was at doing a couple of shopping from the back of my car , I heard a male voice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ our the family ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew the person not .
I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost the consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the hospital .
apparently some women had gotten everything and scre@@ am to scre@@ am .
the man was flying .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I experienced that I f@@ aded two sample @-@ cutting in my right p@@ oul@@ try .
OC Media : in which f@@ oul@@ try they were laid - in men or women ?
Sabrina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name dr@@ auf ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very grateful for this .
when I read his name for the first time at his door , I got it with the fear to do ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ dal name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful to him for he respectful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
they called me , wrote me - Rel@@ ated , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
the slow@@ ed to return to Che@@ chn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie .
they asked absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by moving up without the streets ; others wanted me to go up in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I was not changed my sex , that all was only bad , and Photoshop .
I have body @-@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this print ?
Sabrina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire Republic .
we can not stir you off because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she put a stick around the neck .
luckily the neighbors came and save them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car with a dark window @-@ plate and a numer@@ ical plate with a 95 one .
after it happened the third time , it became clear to me that there was something lazy .
my human right @-@ to @-@ friends audi@@ ted the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons , I don &apos;t want to announce their names but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belie@@ vable .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought them , without having to register without any ID , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
was arrived and checked out in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my cell phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ app , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think about you , just because you have left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people know already , in which hotel du st@@ ew . you even know your room number .
only to tell you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still get in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about the gender equality . however , we do not speak that is a tablet topic .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements still in me .
so I also wish it , these spiritual barrier cannot overcome .
I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them .
when we chat with camera , I actually give myself trouble on how the person to look at which she reminded himself of her past - that is , to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya ?
what do your friends , those who have stayed there ?
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Che@@ chn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who used one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he told that while Ramad@@ an had not been arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not cover a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
in order for me , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person affected and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are even now sw@@ aying men in these secrecy ?
Sabrina : a friend of mine said , there were not very many .
if , then mainly those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to put Kad@@ cy@@ rows judgment .
as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them later as terrorists .
say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be converted , they will show up their bodies on TV and claim that they had attacked some village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation , or do you have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I have just spent someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in the one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after having grown beard .
there have been nothing new since then .
they have simply taken them together .
and this so called Lord , that person was in charge of themselves as these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , there have been no reports so far . however , we suspect such actions are quite possible .
why else would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already occurred in the past ?
Sabrina : I always carried my hair long .
in Che@@ chn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , even before 2003 , I was already known in the whole of Great Britain , when I was still there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
even from 1998 to 1999 when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us back to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately led us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sabrina : my eyebrows were t@@ apped ; I had colored lashes , carried the tube je@@ ans and short T@@ ops .
the Security Council of the Sh@@ aria has never had me a hair too .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , a whole group of people met me .
it was a little place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t say about the mis@@ fortune of another &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one says it often to children if people get funny over the sick .
OC Media : so they just have their eyes locked in front of you because they believed , they are sick ?
Sabrina : yeah .
they have never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sabrina : so long before Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak in television about morality .
he was not talking about us , but mainly about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people caught up in the city to change .
those who be@@ amed earlier and saved , regarded yourself at once with suspi@@ cion .
in the time I left Che@@ chn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic ever worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity will you go now ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I still work as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize teac@@ up , gathering , I beg@@ ining them to the hospital and help them to get Essen@@ tial tickets .
I have no pen@@ ny for this .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ bled shelter .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you join an Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there is no gay !
the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also which , on the whole planet there are they - but &quot; not in Che@@ chn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear what to listen .
I have so many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and while Ramad@@ an - live with men together .
know , many think about Transi@@ tional identity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to be exact , different ways of life .
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and don &apos;t be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not very sad at all - I just know I myself am .
local groups warn of an increase of suici@@ des within the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last months there has been a sharp rise of suici@@ des .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 saw the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the South@@ west of Iran .
he suffered from fear , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ essness to be able to pay the in@@ capacity for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i @-@ human rights groups , who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
a video played on YouTube gave the moments after he had been ign@@ ited .
some people made it quick to delete the fl@@ ames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that doctors could not do anything more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suici@@ de who has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and campa@@ ig@@ ners on site warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights applied for this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ i and Sha@@ wn Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanging .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family pat@@ ernal who were helpl@@ ess and impot@@ ent due to persecution by the Iranian government , who were helpl@@ ess and capable of feeding their families and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the living in Iran living in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to challenge their living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly self @-@ sufficient region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and began to end 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , and some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population barely gets little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime denied the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs and systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
the government also has a variety of dam@@ s , built water from the Arab territory to the Persian regions , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region , and to destroy the local farming as well as fish and palm @-@ trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ war@@ zi youth rose now to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co @-@ operation , work and social welfare , applied to 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who completed a job , finished elementary school , 55 % an ongoing school and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance . &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; resulted in a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suici@@ des under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ah@@ wa@@ z @-@ coming ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting up process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since functional and institutions should not set the Arab force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will be dra@@ gging access to work possibilities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their liveli@@ hoods outside of their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , as even the Arab name at the workplace will not be tolerated , let the voice of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing .
given the given circumstances which the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suici@@ de is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suici@@ de is avoidable .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I identify not with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well through scientific and societal arguments from me , why I should be feminist and why we generally should all be femin@@ ists * inside .
for example , women today still earn less money in spite of the same formation than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epidemic .
or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women have sooner or later emerge in various areas of life to a glorious ceiling , and that discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is well known and known to me .
I am convinced and I lei@@ gh twice and thre@@ e@@ fold beneath .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ community or on black women from the Diaspora . if I have been speaking , on which kind we have been physically , mentally and verb@@ ally ab@@ used , both inside and outside the feminist movement , do not adopt many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lift their voices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they don &apos;t want to talk about that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alized form is rac@@ ist @-@ motiv@@ ating violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and proven@@ ance are less deserve than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background often referred to school as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with a migration background to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence suffer in the partnership as white women .
on the one hand I want all women , all men , and all men of je@@ d@@ neither skin colour the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot connect to a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , which ref@@ uses to relate to both the gender and the skin colour of a person .
I &apos;m exhausted and won &apos;t struggle for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women and again and again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 51 in her speech : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in historical respect a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wei@@ ghty myself to tap into group@@ ings , which also absor@@ bing our customs and customs , to advance its ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to outline white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin colour and sex . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different heart information and borders on the white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to releasing me fully and entirely from femin@@ ism , bringing me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being ins@@ ist@@ ently for a white feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and embark us into the spheres that are created by us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana T@@ ore : recall them ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can defend ourselves , by creating ourselves in our own way , where they are completely safe and where the cultural , mental , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be wor@@ shipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional Fem@@ ales immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of feminist movement of which the black woman is affected .
in a blur@@ red environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , because in that paradigm I exist .
I will be recognized as part of this paradigm based on my dark skin and because of my existence .
I , a black woman , can blos@@ som in an environment in which my life is neither passed , nor ignored .
pad@@ ling against the pollution : the man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by Todd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ geni@@ ous about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
the article will be published once again as part of a content sharing agreement .
repeatedly , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled over the past 7 years - mostly with surf@@ board or can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution at its municipality .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river which we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; said Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of artificial dam@@ s , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Water@@ keeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting and working to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities within the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a takes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we do not have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq based documentary film@@ makers and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed and edited .
the focus of her work lies on the followed , little noted sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with the help of oppressed municipalities to tell their stories about their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women poses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # so@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ ru@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most names have been subject to the protection of the persons concerned .
a police attack said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her Ex@@ partner , who had become violent against it .
since the end of her relationship was some time passed and the police said , its statement would be placed among the files , but more could not be done .
as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of distr@@ acted , also the acute display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez is also nothing .
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
when women report ever once , they do not generally receive support from the state .
in many cases women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence can be reported at all in law enforcement authorities .
contents and Statisti@@ cal 2 Dis@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a judicial system that does not undergo any tri@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good approach , defici@@ ent implementation pun@@ ches and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really bl@@ ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , scientist for gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which do not even show up to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the numbers are however alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District State Building 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was a question of violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were over 5,000 ads because of domestic violence during the peace of peace . there were 86 % of the ads available here .
in the ads there were 40 % of women that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse .
these statistics not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Women Activ@@ in Ana Bai@@ ardi , only few of these crimes are also displayed . &quot; on each woman who is funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic abuse notification , come 9 women who do not do this .
on any woman who re@@ funded due to physical failure , come two women who do not do this , &quot; she said at the end of 2014 .
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ender , the prosecution bodies cannot be properly documented , as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suici@@ de in the country .
the Co@@ ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay were at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died because of violence by men .

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that does not take anything
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends .
in the beginning she did not want to do that , but she still had to regret .
today , Mari@@ ana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she bore mental violence on the one hand - one of the most frequent forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severely recognizable :
I never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that the only women happened that are to sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they are dec@@ ei@@ ving themselves from violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the missions by Carlos Vera .
without name , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them .
many people rep@@ lied to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and not left him before .
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who comes not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has been using them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
you do what many others do not do : they take the claims of women seriously .
in Vic@@ tori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Vic@@ tori@@ as advertisements in the authorities have remained without a result and also by their relatives , she received no support .
it led a process against its former partner who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country in which it primarily worked for money , power and influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , faul@@ ty realization
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not being applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ single ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law appears before , Fem@@ ale became a stand@@ alone crimes , to explain and to pun@@ ish tough@@ er as it is in the neighboring countries , Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legis@@ lature had changed in some points to also win members of the law , which feared that the road for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of de@@ crimin@@ alisation would be paved , which are basically prohibited in Paraguay and punished for up to five years imprisonment .
the initial bill of legislation had planned , the bulk of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process of moving that must be applied to the victims of violence even if they just refund an ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective if the legis@@ lature has not provided sufficient financial resources for it :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paraguay is seen as a part of inter@@ human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a re@@ think has to take place , that violence is no longer regarded as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who swe@@ eps in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the offen@@ se of the offen@@ se .
we need to report as long as the abuse of no longer than normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Senate . previously , parts of the law had been amended , including the passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence has been proclaimed .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section regarding reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack its victims again .
the filing of words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great retreat .

independent media in Oman a year after b@@ anning a newspaper still suspended attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a description of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Foreign Minister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspapers Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting about corruption in the sult@@ ant .
You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he uses a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Num@@ er@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but later again free .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then he was bodied , alongside his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Defence Minister , Chief commander of the Armed Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank .
the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially the domestic secret services , public freedoms , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and de@@ tained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also campa@@ ig@@ ners , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and imprisonment three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which since its inception in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . in this , it was a question of corruption in the judiciary and interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions .
in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure to lift up a verdi@@ ct in an inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n issue of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; senior parties &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Num@@ er@@ al Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Executive Committee , was charged from the ISS before the special department and was arrested on his arrival by the security guards .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS adopted the Deputy Chief of You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j , who had acts as a chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed at an un@@ determined time after the Minister of Information Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 was forbidden . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 the first hearing was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the court condemned the three journalists to prison cell , and also orda@@ ined the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were condemned both among other things because of the disorder of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state of the state . &quot;
al @-@ ha@@ j was found guilty on the violation of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year profession has been imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a sentence amoun@@ ted to 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after it was found to use &quot; an information network for spreading material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a deposit was set in the amount of 5,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 prior to the imprisonment of imprisonment .
the Appe@@ al Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , condemned Al @-@ ha@@ j a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after ex@@ iting of his six months imprisonment . Al @-@ ha@@ j continues to be in prison , where he den@@ ies its one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information , to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper continues to look at the newspaper as before attacks by the Rwand@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information Minister sent a statement that was extended to the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information Minister signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with the ministers responsible for the decision of the Appe@@ al court to meet the release of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of press was violated in Oman .
further violations include , for example , the closing of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ at@@ ine , and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation .
due to the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of the press freedom .
the Gulf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities on :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can go to their work ;
3 . to protect freedom of press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in Oman their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ inhi@@ bited and without fear of condem@@ ning measures , can be exercised in force .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of societies as well as the right to gather peacefully and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on site : for a lack of global healthcare , many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria combined have far more serious impact than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
second , research , which is carried out by African scientists themselves , under construction of own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the centr@@ all@@ ables at the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS @-@ epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania he explored even on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the most effective health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices Dr. Warri@@ er discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research .
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ er speaks as private individual ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ er RW : right now lies the focus of my work on the use of research results . I support the sam@@ ab@@ ian National Programme for Anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
AG@@ A : what do you think is the important current science themes in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this must change , otherwise we will always remain recei@@ vers instead of being movers .
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well supported .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : how is research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research which you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is demand for special scientific training , starting at any age .
the social sciences , computer science , big data , research of outer space , the health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it .
GM : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often , there are limited speed , things to do and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here .
the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research .
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; -@@ seeds producers can change worldwide food production
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous plant , the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NASA &apos;s A@@ stron@@ au@@ ts .
almost 20 years Mor@@ tons has been working only through his own imagination and the question how many sal@@ ine varieties can get , limits .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents protect not only for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green belt or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more of such patents have been registered on ever more plants like grain or cardboard boxes . due to this trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but he still needs more because his work is always worth more and more limitations .
&quot; it &apos;s like going to lie in a river a rock that I have to rep@@ add@@ ling .
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that this patents go far too far .
and if they with@@ stand the court , no one can breed any more a new salad variety , because all the characteristics have already been patented . &quot; he thus makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and makes every effort to use no material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world : open source por@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have red red tube sal@@ at the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there it is tested that plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name seems rather like the movement from the IT sector , and not from the field of plant breeding .
the open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ source &quot; -@@ seeds ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , the alternatives to copyright protected software .
it was called into being to ensure that some plant species and not as intellectual property are protected and so that plant breeders are permanently usable .
as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US @-@ bree@@ der can ple@@ dge that others can use the seeds freely from them .
however , this doesn &apos;t mean that they do not continue to make business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders permit only others who buy seeds to breed , and to breed it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014 .
dis@@ mal outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ ated professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg have control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both for food security and environmental protection .
seeds still play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by doing seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; those who want to buy good , local , and sustain@@ ing vegetables that are offered in August and September 2016 , should also know that the way in which these vegetables are cultivated , is threatened .
nutri@@ tionist without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to providing all their seeds as well . this means that their procedures are opposed to patent well and plant characteristics .

Os@@ si @-@ Sup@@ ported argue that the future of food supplies would be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on the plant material , which is thus more limited to shr@@ inking .
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her doctoral work with a genetic variation with car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property , making it accessible to plant breeders either at all or only difficult .
for other plants there are such estimates yet not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ acres built like wheat in an even bigger style are patented as salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred so that they are specifically designed features - of such by which their taste or colour improves to such circumstances , due to which they prosp@@ ers in certain environments , and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders with more and more patents decreases . genetic variety is currently necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable .
in an e @-@ mail Monsanto @-@ Spe@@ cher@@ in C@@ arly sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos; activities . with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company opted for the conservation of genetic variety .
it contradic@@ ts that the intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of pesti@@ cide @-@ diets innovations promote . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent exp@@ ires .
often these instructions can help others with another method for the same result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , it promotes , by public , it promotes more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years to wait until a patent baptism , is certainly not innovation .
and if you need to wait so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have lost the struggle .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources are always a general well , and they should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ et@@ ular incentives are not attractive for us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible if we cannot continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in total revol@@ t rose mor@@ ton to the concept of itself , plant @-@ features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants make them themselves out and as breeders , we finally have no idea how plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ arol Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the U.S. State Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who is a variety , breeding also breeding its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great hum@@ p and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation of her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , serving in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very well @-@ genetically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized businesses ( such that are moving to international markets but less than B. Monsanto are ) patents possess the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not rewar@@ ding or both is the case .
the independent plant @-@ farmer Frank Mor@@ ton looks for his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

Mor@@ ton is also the view that breeders from the A@@ void of Plant @-@ makers were innovative : &quot; it looks like I can produce something new with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies .
I need constantly new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors are selling my varieties within a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are 20 years ahead of competition , with my opinion pretty simple makes .
though the US seems to be leading in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , why the Os@@ si commitment cannot simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission declares that unconventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent , which allows patents to conventional plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; it is now on the governments of the Member States , the patent , to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seeds , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and seed companies from very East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sponsorship of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , that the organisation is currently producing a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start .
a consortium of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food - a composite of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - has published it that farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds , to exchange and improve the seed policy so that stable supply can be ensured with food .
the report also emphasises the importance of a versatile , local supply with seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between Lu@@ by and Os@@ si hopes that they will soon realize more people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has mainly been respected where and how it is grown , and seed systems have hardly ever played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to make the people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ or@@ ship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian government content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August the Egyptian government documents the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) that documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August , the network published an opinion on Facebook where it is sharply critici@@ zed by the Egyptian authorities for this step , and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Network for Human Rights Information remain unaffected in spite of this attack and the spot@@ ting of the Egyptian Right and the Constitution of the authorities , to un@@ cover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , even though it was never so difficult to pursue these goals , so it was never as important as it now . AN@@ HR@@ I was confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted , to overcome the block and not give us . we ins@@ ists to keep our task further .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites , as b@@ as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , arab@@ o @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the published network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of side bul@@ locks to the victim please . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / N@@ IZ@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , there is also no access to the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and Human Rights Reser@@ ves Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he does not write to open websites and media in Egypt .
now the blog , which he erected in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ors of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack .
Blog@@ ger , the provider who is also resident to Zi@@ adas blog , however , is even more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards during December 2013 and took a video on how police force bodily violence against two students .
his articles are based primarily about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him :
the , blogs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ted @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the block@@ age of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is however for two reasons for me :
1 ) It was able to give me the feeling of a sie@@ ge of sie@@ ge ; a arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading of the National Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to the post of articles to byp@@ ass the cens@@ or@@ ship .
now , after having blocked him and , that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the mu@@ e@@ tigen go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this will add technical tests to networks of various Internet service providers ( ISP ) , including orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at .
AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age of vendors , which was possible through the relocation of inter@@ net@@ work@@ ship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
on Monday , 12 of June we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer .
such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content , which might have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated that the cens@@ ors will be made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to approach them in the court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or@@ ship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are argu@@ ing .

newspapers will report a day of newspapers from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous post@@ cards .
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old are shot at school &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second day , a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die@@ be smo@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sent 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air Force to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence of 2017 in Rio has been the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice even called on the UN to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the manager of a local newspaper .
for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the editorial , &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which they announced , a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will now be published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sexual crimes , etc . everything that happens from the civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists are not engaged in our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only daily newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
the same video explains a re@@ porter of the newspaper , that according to data provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are criminals that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial writes the newspaper continues :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is distorted to also be used , cru@@ ises of the police , who sho@@ ots and then ask questions to cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose purpose is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
the name &quot; War &quot; is more than its useful ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l ar@@ gues the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ vei@@ ra to design@@ ate the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion a justification of failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police accountable .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and worse planning - like extra in the analysis of the military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ counter@@ f@@ use of public service .
in memory : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 non @-@ violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 to the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most recent data available .
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .
when we look at the M@@ ord@@ rates per state , Rio is on place 16 , &quot; she writes .
extra belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , such as Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been emphasized since years the security policy of the state .
among these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the State of Rio in 2003 , which aims to conquer a massive police force in fav@@ ela and permanently station@@ ed there .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a withdrawal of violent death deaths . however , for several years , the U@@ PP ought to protect itself after several reports on Shi@@ kan@@ en and repres@@ sions against poor con@@ gregations that should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack .
on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio has also serious consequences for the human being .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this calls for the state to use the means and ways that are typical for a war . in addition , the intru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enemy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ lateral defects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war@@ ped balls &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
war one or her , fact is that the people of fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer .
one week it is now that the police er@@ kl@@ ash the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an .
in the midst of all this violence this incident made : a fruit @-@ seller died as a result of shots , which the police had fired from a helicopter .

to stay alive : bel@@ ated Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
scre@@ enshot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sie@@ ge and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ insti@@ tut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of sie@@ ge .
particularly strongly affected is the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 prompted the life of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition remain on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of Assad regime has been practi@@ sed .
since 2013 , those of rebels controlled regions outside of Damascus have stood under sie@@ ge that caused inhabitants to be reli@@ ed on the local or through tunnels and control points .
traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population .
as a bac@@ kl@@ ash , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional ones in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many people of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta .
the Director of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said against the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we decided to cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because you can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that had been fought for three years to make this project , and expressed his relief from that it gains more and more &quot; famili@@ arity . &quot;
to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nah@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do .
it is planned to convey 125 families knowledge to planting mushroom , so Dr Lei@@ la &apos;s Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12.@@ 700 € but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do .
the initiative is dependent on generators that maintain the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity in 80 % .
due to the fuel t@@ apping , locally bre@@ wed fuel is used for plastic , to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of native mushrooms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they control their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsequently they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was managed , they used a larger tube . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have been able to spread mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom stem from different reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : fraction of the sie@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new source of food on the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating foods ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success , as well as our fight against hunger and the sie@@ ge becomes visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of district villages in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires , which were gra@@ zing in the north of Portugal last week .
forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government spent the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires also were registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 dead .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 g@@ arri@@ es out@@ breaks , spread abroad in the northern and centrally located regions of the country , and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , a similar tragedy was held in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and over 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite images , 2017 , in Portugal for approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon .
so that you can make a better picture of the ear@@ nest@@ ing situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread out on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the event :
the ab@@ si@@ gh@@ able tragedy
the aim of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to intimi@@ date the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João Sover@@ al from the federal government of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are d@@ ashing reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June , as the streets were locked very late . &quot;
furthermore , construction permits in loc@@ alities with high fire risks are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching suggestion for the rolls made by the government according to heavy fires in the years 2003 and 2005 has been inv@@ oked by the commun@@ es objec@@ tion@@ able that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the applicant an open door to self protection - that was an open door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; introduces João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light burning wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , to spread this way more and more .
in addition to these problems comes that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as local people seek information or attempted to contact persons , go offline .
it was a private initiative that cat@@ ers the population with information : you took advantage of your own civilian defen@@ ders with the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and inform the people in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire bri@@ gade and was taken at this f@@ ateful weekend in October so that the servers of the landing of the 400@@ ,000 users who watched the fires : while the site counted more than half a million hits .

in one night in the autumn of 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . so Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair .
exactly at this time , A@@ shar@@ ks Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother said it was not that way , she knew that she would not see her son a very long time - maybe even more .
in the morning dawn the boy should vom@@ iting .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara &apos;s dom@@ ed party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt prot@@ ru@@ ff .
the Taliban taken for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara @-@ Taliban were ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
some days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ k found himself again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coher@@ ence . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of its low money and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mort@@ ar , which were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , as today , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterised by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ entino in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an abandoned building on the job@@ site , which we worked on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hanging n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we were not refres@@ hed at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made it ready for travel to Europe .
on the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application , Ach@@ ie@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time was Ach@@ ie@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of relief to the needy .
true , it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for legitimate asylum seekers . however , it is true also that the conditions , asylum seekers in the country are to be cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil War Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of the asylum seekers is housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special recording centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording centre , if they officially have placed an application for asylum - which can still be submitted once again after the registration of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
so it also erg@@ ate acts .
but its irre@@ pres@@ sible vi@@ vi@@ ous helped as@@ car@@ ve to liber@@ ate itself from these conditions soon .
after spending several years different working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ k set his entire savings into the founding of a hostel in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ el@@ limb@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ zo@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess is now the theme of the documentary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates about 20.000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution to other European countries .
in the last few years some of the companies operating in Afghanistan , including cutting plants , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some af@@ ici@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the different af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entreprene@@ ur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail and aim to go back to the country which he had to be forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .

I never forget my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer .
I have a project for farmers from the poorest provinces in the country , especially for women .
they represent half of society and have to get the same ways as everyone else . &quot;

the Egyptian parliament checks a draft law which proposes that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency .
user would have to be able to use the social networks within six months of civil law@@ makers on the website of the authority under stating their full name and expulsion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment , or the final rep@@ ay@@ ment of a criminal rep@@ ay@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , is currently under legislative and constitutional committee in the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there .
may be another member of the member of the Parliament to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or of a high officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law the off@@ end of the President as well as state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the legislative proposal , such an act would be swe@@ pt with prison and money pen@@ alties , so far the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the surve@@ ying .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while he showed Egyptian polic@@ emen , demonstrated against the military coup that led against the military coup d &quot; é@@ tat against the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , just as more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in detention to a Geri@@ cke .
recently , his trial was postponed until the 20th of May because the prison quarters of human rights groups was accused of bringing the def@@ endants of the prison into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
Sha@@ w@@ kan threatened the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , hypo@@ exposure of other weapons @-@ ownership , illegal gathering , murder and physical murder .
in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza considered the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Barb@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya place in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisian activists tri@@ cked to the tri@@ ck@@ led documents
may we have been Tunisian authorities six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ n , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project .

this document released on 21 April on the site of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , casts a light on how the presidential plans to support the legis@@ lature look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the disclosure of his sources under indication of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Release which journalists ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis on 09 . May as a witness in the event .
will China force the users of social media to submit their ID ?
after new provisions of the Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need permission to write or share social media in China before they write news in social media .
the provisions will also indicate that registration will be necessary with the full real name .
analysts suspect that through the elimination of anonymous comments in enter@@ tain@@ ments within social networks shall be achieved . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
Chinese ma@@ ins have suggested in the social media to enforce these rules only selective in order to protect citizens &quot; journ@@ alism and its independence .

this name is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government introduces a list of online services , which allows the government to organise the publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data .
