<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">How many of my generation I grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had a profound effect on me, that I was directed mainly because of an American film journalist.</seg>
<seg id="6">When the 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelatic letter, with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stuff, who covered the Supreme Court with judges, who were inclined to seize his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to method Man," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona, had only increased my admiration for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then, Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most exceptional aspect of his ascension is for me, as he continues with his narrow-minded approach.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, how a former colleague put it, and openly explains his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes which he won during the Republican elections was the highest number, who ever reached the nominate candidate.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I was unable to reconcile Trump and its voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, takes people from all over the world, a deep unbeliever person, with whom I could entertain myself about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumps World illustrative not coincided with the Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Insomnia is also a contrast to generosity that I lived with Sandy Bahr, who fought for her life long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is still adapting to Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then, there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot with my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those who are embodied by them are deepening my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump has eased his way to the nominees of Republican presidential elections, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps, because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The examination of the idea that people have voted for Trump because they shared either its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "to arrange the person, one of my friends said, is exactly what we have led to that situation." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their churches are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might want to say that in this America they are still important?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick who commentated on the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "does.: as much as" "" "disarmament of white against all other ethnicities" "" ": word of white in contentment at the white and whiplash, which means as much like slingdertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones, has exactly killed what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people all over the world value the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or the background one always likes, America is every welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise, saying, Hell with Variety, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the ruin, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all that I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a vocible "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "brood the crowd." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "I answered them." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a single and soundproof "NEIN!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan closed with words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">That is now Trumps Land, said the message.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And this leaves me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero village in the province of Oaxaca, with the children of the paraguaean city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music, played at both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is situated at the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is very popular among tourists -but worlds from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years, La Banda de Música (Musikbande) is now playing in the community: a symphony Symphony Orchestra, which has found a way to overcome poverty by their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and banking violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth become so rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious, the local press notary Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of the school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dust roads to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the Truly you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, pgos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with recycled instruments produced from local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycled under the direction of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of apostasy in instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitated violins, viola, Celli, double bass, guitars, saxophone, trumpet, trumpet, trombones, and percussion, all made out of the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by Los Angeles Times recalls Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musician teacher of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:</seg>
<seg id="87">First, it was very difficult because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the garbage - the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio somewhat was shown what he had never seen before: one out of waste-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments produced from played material and which is called The Port Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) stands out for the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tonnes of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as men in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from garbage to music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra also played music even before Pope Francis,</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fought the wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication happens as part of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already been operated in lifican waters illegal fishing, before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly aggravated and little inclined to welcome a legislative brecher of this kind in its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to give him one of their harbours and refused to give it a fisherman building.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that you simply refused to spend," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries" "", "he is part of a team who discovered the ship at its time and followed." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, because of looting the fish stocks of the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and safeguards resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegally fishing (Illegale Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which at that time had driven the prime minister of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other when it comes to illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegal fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, whose due to it extremely difficult to assimilate. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of the overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Through the deliberate discontempt of existing laws, by which specific habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate equilibrium.</seg>
<seg id="111">However, while actions against illegal fishing once were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also passed through the snakento, with the information between individual countries, so the actions are happening in real-time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses, information about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move on the open sea, through satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in the bottted regions - such as those who suggest that a ship will leave his domesticated fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "" "" "ideally, such studies show whether the participating ships have a fish License, where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a Strafregister." ""</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing, may refuse the acceptance of such vessels in their ports. what does the ships do not sell their load to sell, and that they could even be forced to pay off penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "we then deal with significant financial losses for the owner, which means that the illegal fishing fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, head director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a counseling company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed Front</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform was created to get estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose the eight members of the network HISH-i each year due to illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing villages that attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Its practices among other things include actions like the sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, stating from fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "specifically, you use the missing international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of a non-fully organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "earlier, a ship could illegally fishing and a country could then say" You do not want to walk my harbour. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'comm to me'. and precisely this legalistic slip hole tried to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminals that have distributed counterfeit licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has been persecuted and found-fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Because of its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can split information to illegal fishing over large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us pretty far into the" "" "organized crime" "", "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that is to help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be further developed will also help to divide the illegal ships who likes to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships may turn their automatic identification systems, with what they can no longer be ordered by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels. it should help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations have actually influence on this undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has recently opened the platform Global Fishing Watch the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown around the world through which the position of every single tormentable ship can be shown around the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts have a similar project to run where a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only feel criminals but they are also deterred.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships who exploited earlier without a license and hardly reckoned with consequences, now they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i now has a 33% increase in fisheries revenue, since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to record Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board gripping nets, whose use is forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "also other countries notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that now we have other countries to copy," "" "says Kiilu." "" "in West Africa a few hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have joined together to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, following exactly the same model as FISH." "" "safety is the goal of bringing more such initiatives and structures even in other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member country could report its first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license and were used gripping nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 put a strong signal that they proceed against illegal fishing." "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time evidence that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works throughout the World Sea.

<seg id="197">This is a adapted version of an interview of Alejo Gómez, with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinian news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the meantime, he said Quijano in the context of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the process, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes were investigated that were committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting at the Bürde, the same names as his father carry to the brutal military perations in the prison of La Perla, which he was observed at the age of 15, he has suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he held the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation back then, I believed that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret magical.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child of 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, the latter and the murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was gendarmeriegator. during the Argentinean military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy commander of the secret services department, 141 in the prison of La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archiving.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is charged with kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the abduction of a 10-year child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who over the years had seen the extent of the atrocities that he had been witnessing as a boy, and who said before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows, which great power has a parent about his child, and how this child chose to make a path to salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take part in the sports base, I often went to the sports hall, often with us. there I was rounded with a boy who did combat sport.</seg>
<seg id="217">All ncalled him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an Arschloch, you have rounded yourself with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Passport only that they will not end you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party in Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he offered me to go back to the sports hall. some days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He said to me, I would be a secret.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine. because so my father loved me.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy Papers who heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university inclusions, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, proagandamaterial, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla with - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first time and last time he let me wait at the entrance to the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he accepted me the second time, he commanded me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just all possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little into a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were shut down, and held me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">There the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I moved in and saw a couch, tortured on the human race.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field-bed and metal-feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cabinet. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captivated there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They rarely gets a person with handcuffs on the bed, poured him with water and said to him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="244">Years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that it is the smell of a body in need.</seg>

<seg id="248">'I knew that these people were killed '</seg>
<seg id="249">When my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La cuadra - the area where the prisoners were captivated with handcuffs and to bind them.</seg>
<seg id="250">He spoke with "Chubi" Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also charged in the process) and I took advantage of taking a look at La cuadra.</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked men face with the face downward - all were captivated by hands and feet.</seg>

<seg id="264">Here their names have changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization.</seg>
<seg id="265">If they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the arrangement of the top came that they should be relocated.</seg>

<seg id="275">I have always wondered how my father, the head of security forces, could participate in this vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also officers with the Gendarmerie and I would never like to penetrate into a house and steal anything in it.</seg>

<seg id="348">At a shield, the Japanese word in the fact that the "older motorist" means, wrongly, perhaps even with evil hoists, & # 8212; were translated as "terrible motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The false translation was on electronic advertisements from the 1st to September 20 to read in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing the original photos of Joshua Levine, often shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, one of the inhabitants of Kyotos. he was also who made aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun's Kyoto daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto just unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>

<seg id="357">The Kyoto police apologised for the translation errors. furthermore, they explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not tested for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows on the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely hope that older people felt by the insufficient correction (the translation) made of our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News set out a little more detailed with the phenomenon of "frightful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "awful" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police there are the percentage of older drivers involved in nuclear accidents, but quite cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents of seniors was caused by Seniors. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a real treasure trove for this bizarre error in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo from Flickr-users Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To overuse one requires two key abilities: passive voice skills to understand the starting text and active language skills in order to transfer him into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with motherboards. in general, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be.</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French mother tongue should translate for example from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo from Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ people with English as a mother tongue who could make translations into English. this may be lacking understanding of excessive, cost-reasons, or the relatively small number of English native languages to learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even do not have foreign employees, leave the translations of their company internally. then, the Japanese staff, whose English skills are considered to be the best, no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo from Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbatim and puzzling phrases that are created by machine translation show that this technique can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylish reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo from Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least be harmless at least. but by large companies or from the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect thorough translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto will hopefully use a reputable source for their translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant at the coverage of protest in 2014. at that time, the Commission had initiated them with cash payments and lockings if they continue to report about the demonstrations as the Commission looked at this as a "call to violence."</seg>

<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro confirmed later that not only Vivoplay through a block of the Domain Name System (DNS) is inaccessible but also two other online channels. this also concerns the website where the National Assembly exceeds its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous post-research of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, we revealed that local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique that can critically answer certain domains through which the DNA server requests certain domains.</seg>

<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in police-ahring.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went back on show.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates the Internet connections: this makes the Venezuelers access to multi-media reporting about current events in the country ever more complicated.</seg>

<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, they referred to Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money outputs her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child will eat food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">"" "" "" "however, what is not mentioned here is that children must afford to spend countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this in the context of a contract which one cannot lift up." ""</seg>
<seg id="425">These as Criadazgo's practice is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After completing her studies, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization dedicated to the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">In doing so she spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of criadazgo - gathered witnesses, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">They tried to name things in the name, because the feeling of gratitude that is vaccinated the criber, is guaranteed in general.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double delusion," "" "says Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, she is the family that her daughter in believing that she will be able to complete their education, improve their position in society and "something out of themselves" can be transferred to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who performs the girl and his exploitation is justified by faith that they give someone a chance that would otherwise be given no training and perhaps even starving.</seg>

<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was criadita in the household of the former Military Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo who works as an official at the locals.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital of Asuncion.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck long as long as a stick on Marín until they suffered fatal injuries.</seg>

<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the Murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations like UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice deeply rooted in the paraguayischen society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">"" "several dozen people came to protest leaders and called for there" "" "no further Carolina" "" "in Paraguay." ""</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>

<seg id="449">Without Papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control, under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>

<seg id="457">Her brothers now had to work and started to sell on the street or on the market sweets to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina has been sent as Criadita in the capital of Asunción.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami - the state of affairs in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi).</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and is still engaged in the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo agreed to reconstruct the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who had been affected by the "Trinity catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the Preyagi Prefecture of Miyagi was a number of Prefectures in Japan's Northeast that had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to disappear, because the tsunami had disappear whole coastal cities out of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">Even more, the prefecture of Fukushima lived a nuclear accident, already alone because of that, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report from the Kahoku Shimpo show that progress has been achieved six years later in order to re-establish the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes statistics of the Japanese reconstructions as well as survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing situation in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement buildings (in the US market, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi has been the biggest success among the three prefectures. miyagi was shown here, 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is 70 percent of the final light at Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, it is still trying to settle for six years after the catastrophe, evacuated evacuation by Behind shelters (in the US), Kazaksu juutaku) in final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold catastrophe nearly 80 000 people had forced to live in secret shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such politations.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of the evacuated people from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 per cent of the evacuated shelters were nourished after the disaster in domination.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is up here at 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">How the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 by 1100 schools who were affected by unhappiness, their doors until December 2016, which constitutes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of fisheries harbors in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, only 30 percent of fisheries harbors their operation at Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident, have taken a lot of passion in the three prefectures of the agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of arable land, and less than 50 percent of arable land in Fukushima can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely, that this is only a consequence of the nuclear waste, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of arable land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered and recovered over again, but also here Fukushima still remains undefeated.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwates are back up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. on the contrary, only 75 percent can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe is almost half of the coast-inhabitants, it's harder to get their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">To determine a total picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys under the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked her about the state of rebuilding and also how its empathy have changed in front of the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction of this article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 per cent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in case of disasters-prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuated the Fukushima Prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="576">In their edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the situation of evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had not only had the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, Catalan, nuclear waste, if the Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people of evacuated from Fukushima became almost 63 000 people in areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, something more than 23 000 people were resettled back after Fukushima, in permanent replacement buildings.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the status of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima off their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophenols, most of the evacuated shelters are still less than 50 years old. they have to come back in right Behausungen efforts, because efforts are competing for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is a part of the Olympic Games that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people encounter people from other countries who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, one recognizes however often that a more connects than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important since they are asking our prejudices to expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast we treat topics, which often get less attention in the coverage than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices members who want to remember a moment in which they have felt very strong with someone over language and country boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherini speaks like the love of music has consolidated their affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias speaks about the time where she worked with people from all over the world; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences, which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="627">The people of Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, who is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of the fact that there are no noteworthy sugar-harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane of sugar have been paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After waking up the sugar industry in the region fell silent, and the factory lost and after its plants, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to reinvent itself.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some of them rarely changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resignified and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, which stands every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar roar industry did not robbed his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugars in the east of the region of sugar, who are in operation after a long time because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene is reminded of having heard that in MañalI would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise has not been held.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar industry had already opposed the plagues, the case of socialism, the low market prices, the inefficiencies, the bad administration decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar, less than the 1910 produced.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad experiences already have no news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why has the Cuban sugar industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway station of the community already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economical need: the 155 sugar beadfactories were technically outdated, and barely competitive they were intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate the production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that they can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives, which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025 the price of unrefined sugar has to stay between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to 2016, published by the OECD and the FAO, the agricultural and food organisation of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would be in charge of around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From there the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years the lactation came from a total of 98 sugars, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closing of the factory, the word he is most repeated, "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Nearly all respondents are the same opinion, not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>

<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister was able to authorise every decision.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was carried out, and the letters came more and more frequent.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important to them. they are doing this by Hip Hop, thanks to a number of migrant workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, since 2014 the workshop leader Mobile Tonstudios leads directly to schools and youth centers to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio- and video-production and live appearances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were run by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then working with the Cree Hip Hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus creating that the young participants in talks like "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' yoo in the field of the tribe of the Kitsumalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, the history of Highway 16, also "Highway of tears," a street section in Westkanada, on which almost two dozen young women were missing or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely ignored.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs, in spite of the influences by globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people have not always control the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has been recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip Hop group, who gave them a strophe in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebooksite of N'we Jinan is available to the verses in Belgrade, just a translation into English, which is translated from here into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like wouldn't ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on earth for my days</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan one can gaze in front of almost every restaurant plastic meals.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers exactly what is exactly on the menu, are being exhibited near the entrance shokusepuru (which is known, "Plastic models of the courts") from each dish that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">The customers see these plastic courts and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacturing of these plastic courts.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are numerous of these small companies that produce even those plastic dishes, which made the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga over 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even find them anymore. however, a new trend is turning it into conspicuous cell phones and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos, which show this unusual twist with the shokuseaquu.</seg>

<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo train station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple who gives your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to see like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-estrogen is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "are there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can make my mobile phone with salmon-oestrogen?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will probably be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic supplies can also take a less appetizing form to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest phone-stand-handed has the shape of melted ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also travel balls (onigiri), earrings and handyors from dried salmon.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports in foreign and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico the mishes and gearboxes regularly perform only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which brings this struggle to itself.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapman Guzmán, the head of the Zaloa Kartell, urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">On the day after a nonviolent incident, hardly anyone looks at the sadness or the churches that have learned to live with pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">They are behind every body, behind every bone, in the hundreds of enmer diggers, the stories of countless parents, children and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds will never heal.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político gives the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with drug trafficking), should give this sacrifice a voice and stories of people who rent a voice in the fight between law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be afraid to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The impact is far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when shops close, because they are threatened by drug traffickers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk.</seg>

<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que cambian por el fordo" "" "(German:" "" "how afraid life" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>

<seg id="785">No, it is not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is Narco (German: drug dealers) will, if he is great. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroism" of offenders, if they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is, as if they beckled those who have lost someone and those who fear that such thing happens.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories come to mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the insomnia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearances of 43 students in a neighbor town will be justified that they were" "" "blackly." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a guard and he tells you had to teach yourself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm, and "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and dairy powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for all life of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years earlier, when he looked at only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, which was shot by armed men from a passing by car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was mingled by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder on public security and government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the section 8.5 Mora per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories are in view of getting new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político 2015 brought into life, whose aim consists of representing the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades, in intelligible way.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (frames) that undergo these postings. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used regarding greater discussions about the silence in the context of the murder of Christians through Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how a African life is valued as compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth examining how images in connection with these efforts are used.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question is, however, what happens when readers do no longer believe these pictures.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media there are tens of people who have accidental loss to exercise the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of mis- and false information, that actual atrocities are untrue and narrowns it the real atrocity of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">An argument is that withhold images of a refusal to acknowledge the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent pictures readers and viewers are desensitise and give them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, explored how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there are a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment because with algorithms to support the fight against "Fake News". you will think thoroughly about the situation where a picture suggests a little, which actually can also be replaced by the context or on completely misgable way.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name Untranslatable (e.g. Dt. insurable) endeavours to offer linguists a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to be translated at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in each language: they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these unenforceable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example the Spanish Sobunesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all contradictory to each attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, why a full explanation and sometimes a bit context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and Linguist from "Untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In this blog you can find words from the Mwotography language of Vanuatu, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - opt for your parents in recognition of how you have endeavored to take you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunscreen language spoken in parts of Brazil such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after having warmed up in cold days in the sun.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defendants other cultures, revealing other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence the world around us and classify the linguists on this site still want to publish more of these "unsurable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility, here and now despite a language barrier to get in touch with someone?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) the proceeds of stories in their original language is a possible answer to that.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the Untranslated blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the one hand, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of major cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin exists in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has already performed events for 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the Preacher of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mannequin of languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, reflecting Diversity - safe spaces where inhabitants don't have to forget who they are to be part of.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "while" "" "listen is often associated with it," "" "these events instead" "" "hear these events instead" "" "to appreciate" "" "to feel, to feel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers put their story first and translated into their own language and then explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their dedication and their presentation lead to the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laugh and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows for example a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou are also the opportunity to explain the typical customs of storyart for their land.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of the hares and Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After he explains the meaning of his plot, John Nyamusara is asked: "how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language?" with a wide grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">You were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You were completely with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organizers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storyteller.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re-publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is focused in Berlin is devoted to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the company based CNRS institutes for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühlers, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints' finished books within three to five days, lasen extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which has been published last year, and licences are freely available here, contains a number of papers that deal with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is called:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the true costs are, with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have been side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our newsroom and to make some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers, who has been incarcerated since March 15, 2012 in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was painted out of the directory of the Adra prison, where he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information on its current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice that will push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us begin to think about their own destinates, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process of temporary convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in detention on Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" was taken on the basis of a "strict secret" command of military judgment from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as Insider of the Assad's government and made them knowledge of the alleged death event against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His place of residence and state remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in extending access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technical officer and at the moment passed the head of New Palmyra, a project, which founded the Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Baser cultural prototypes are prescient as the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins Palmyras virtuell.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites of the world, was the cross-crossing of numerous civilizations and fusing Greek-Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would ignite all this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strike into digital archaeology and the conservation has created a time-capsule that will be invaluable to the public, as well as scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">As a result, Bassel has not yet been able to complete this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I have spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel brought me English in English, even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He always shared his knowledge with each one who asked. he has taught other detention, to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet at.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also included other detention, as they use computers, at least theoretically, without them having actually kept one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proverb, which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 as he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book a year.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mosambique: because of corruption repression, after the release from prison</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted to a corruption by turning a government member after half of his sentence to work in the state apparatus, where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the Mosambique airports, whose council Cambaza was standing between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately demanded his reinstatement to the company, which happened on April 19, then.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with an opinion of the General Manager of the Republic, which indicated the request, there would be no obstacles to refer to Cambaza, again its old post as the company was not a lack of discipline after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't have the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Transportation (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director back:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "there is a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have entered a lack of discipline against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"" "" "" "however, the firm seems to be effective however and does not establish appropriate legal steps for applying the corresponding functions." ""</seg>
<seg id="1265">In Eídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosambian social media, this behavior also rejects and considers the case as a "reluctance":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be adviser after he was sentenced to a sentence and that half of them were lowered.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and commit his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since it is incompetent, he has consented to be integrated into the company, which he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore, it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Reluctant!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mosambique and Student of Political Science in Brazil says the director of no morality:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he offended it I can not believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that has already ripped the state already so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but rather has only served itself by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible money source, and the state itself became tired of the man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief belongs to the prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered as a first independent president for ever, but also as a sharper, tribution, and - side by side, prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral portrayals was, when he acknowledged that "a ambitious man is capable of everything, including Fatherland for his ambition, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that this is not so. it changes the tactics, but it does not turn its ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">A ambitious person is a criminal. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also declined:</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmical word "Kalar PAE" means kickpea or spilage.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo of Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the popular social network took their postings out of the web, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although on the origin of the word still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East Indian origin, or generally used as adjective. "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the" "" "Kalar" "" "(in Burmical script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of harassation in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements of the word has given an extremely abomous connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word which mostly uses ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Burma.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight Hassworks in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar's may normally be associated with racism but the word itself is not automatically forth.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about his use of use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Furthermore there are several smesic words with the different meanings that have the same character as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair is written to Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spage), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookout Aung Kaung explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was today deleted, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However he had asked his friends in a spiritual way, if she knew how he could soothe his back pain by doing a word play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "Healing" "" "(ku) on Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Hage is the opinion that they need to be more radical nationalists, but she also stressed that Facebook must be analytic before it deletes all posts that are in suspicion to spread racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook deletes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "not manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to analyse the mail carefully and control it by checking the words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example," "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar PAE" "" "(alternats)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good is that these three-legged nationalists will spread the harassation, a rather good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all, disseminating the language, the efficiency of this strategy doesn't hold long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords will often begin a cap and mouse game, whereby users use social networks simply to use a new word or an alternative writing of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his postings, as he wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I was aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post office was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours because the post "Facebook Community standards did not fail."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts from people that have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate-talk radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are poor in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmical Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma due to their platform, but it doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "such words to censor will only bring more hatred within the different communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "furthermore, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned such words as" "" "throne" "" "or" "" "heredicurry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they have made mistakes, they don't tried to correct the miserased postings.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million health benefits they had a great deal, it would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery under users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now about Facebook funny and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate language to see if their postings are taken from the net.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The marriage-marriage is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1344">On 9 June 2017, the Parliament's parliament adopted unanimously a law which aims to ban this practice, so that the old age of 18 is now at 18.</seg>
<seg id="1345">Before this change of the marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016 it came to a large public outcry. at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, a group, representatives of the various religious groups of the country gather that the state does not interfere with, since that, age is not the maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">This happened in spite of the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the UN's rights invention, the minors of minors, for each person under the age of 18.</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 were 8,1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011 the statistical summary of the country confirmed that from 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys in 19 were married.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements who were endeavouring to create laws to pah, followed at the bottom, and gratify great support. undoubtedly they helped to bring this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, it did not go smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, Z. B. had no concerns, the criticisms of the pah, they should, have doomed to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition sought tensions in this actually uncomplicated matter, and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children's before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent which contained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now just the president of the country must agree and preach the law." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the Senators of the country gave us a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram has posted:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr Senator Clarbharat: the draft law against the children's marriage was held in the House of Representatives with 35 votes against it and not on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Once he was decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of the social media user was thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage have been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook-member Lovell Francis, who was a minister in the ministry of education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It has too much time and unnecessary talk needed to wear the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's before is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago and that is almost every cost worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson of mind was, it was definitely long enough to create the practice, Lara Quentriall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day was finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, voices - 35 for it - 0 on it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folly Mutota, which belonged to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group that spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law is, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The delicate age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious community of 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft to the amendment of the German Law was announced today, on June 9, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 members in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All Members who were against have voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long battle (...) # childrenrot.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who have received him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Maharaj therefore, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">"" "" "" "ahead of months Maharaj has announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed and he seems to redeem his promises now." ""</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the General State prosecutor Paris Al rawi, a champions of the law, argued that if Maharaj would apply against the law, most social media users would wish to tackle the debate on the subject in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion so general, in a way that only panic and disgrace would be able to speak, that the state, our daughters from before, that they may possibly be abused to carry out die discussion, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you believe it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children's deer are legal or remains the norm even though there are laws which they say.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By the mirrors of web pages, Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The English-speaking Wikipedia-page was presented on 18 January 2012, contradictory to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the US, internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over one month Turkey has now blocked Turkey the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopaedia Commons.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer, how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information to find and share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series rebelling against the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technologic Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocking websites (an up-to-date articles from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third-largest VPN Prevalence of the World), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">While Turkey has blocked articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society on Harvard University, find regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act was adopted (No. 5651).</seg>
<seg id="1398">To China, Turkey is the largest country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains closed, there are several mirrorpages (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (thus computer machines), which does not base itself on the system of domain name and thus making a complete censorship.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available despite legal prohibition however.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost we report IPFS about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we heard the news (about the blockage of Wikipedia), we put everything to cover snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if you cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS was also involved that this step is independent of the Wikimedia-Foundation and it's just about screenshots and no live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that anyone can use to host similar skin sites if in the respective country is locked in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as staff at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">There is no complete copy of a proxy-address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You attack on a different URL that is not the original one. that which one can then see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server directs the request to the right Wikipedia-page so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia, then when it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was with the photos he saw around him, never satisfied. they were blurry with poorly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivator even to wear a camera to himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar has endeavored to bring herself to the international scene at the age of 28.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos which direct attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, like him this prime location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographers!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I looked at home just at home when suddenly called Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard was a leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to co-operation with the authorities to achieve global recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know it, for he rose tigers already from face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can't be bothered by the opinion of the sheep by the sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping-time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home, when suddenly the king of the Bukowski appeared. he immediately sets up, we look at and he srt me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar is placed the logo "I click for tut" (lit.: I clicked for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the advancement of Nepalese and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to make in Bardia National Park recordings of Ottern. up to 12 days lasted until he could take a tiger photograph and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist office.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayona az Acia and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">An revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India women are avoiding the greatest care to speak the name of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "Father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women give women to respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences, they should pay the norm to keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned by the Indian state Odisha by a hill and rejected by her family and the village community after having responded to a married relatives by name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition their wives also do not call on name, is also common among men. however, they have much less replacements to fear, if at all, what, should they not occur in this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, came nine women, including health guards as well as housewives, a unique club and became the main theme theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Being one of 56 clubs that there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and is committed to the reduction of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with the help of her video camera in the uncovering of practices, such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-Ininfected, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports on how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of change at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, were women who don't name their husbands under the name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">To speak out the name of their husbands out, is a Brit, which they maintain all the dutifully and never asked into question.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not einholding this is deemed to be deposited, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of that discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning of the Rohini, who previously wanted her husband to never be named with the name, try at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband stopped for a long time after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in his luggage, Rohini started their first discussion of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, mainly girls and women were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the lap Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After video-projection the women tried to get the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, upset, sad, affectionate and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked, "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want it means they do not respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the braking of a century-old tradition, in which married women never allowed the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she had just kicked her during the whole practice, and she decided to let him out all the aned frustration against him and his family by cursed him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin rush to have broken with an age-old bread, the women decided that they would actually attempt at home to name their husbands on behalf.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their say.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini was given a multitude of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a wife called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">A different club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she was solidified, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini said, I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation returned to violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the dip-red point on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"" "" "" "I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred dot if he was doing so." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only, and I listened to carrying him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women did not quit completely with it, but mean they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussionlub is a safe place where they can replace their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we will make an excursion during each discussion." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">During the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and hung up and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have said about some things, for example like our identities on our husbands, have never been so honest.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to say certain things noisy, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been at Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most of them that is okay, but some have wanted a Salman-Kurta, a vast shirt over a pants, they did not believe.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of arguments and discussion about the merits of your own clothes-choice, morality associated with the Saris and much more, smuggled Rohini their own pair of cures (upper hemden) in a panel discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they have now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is certain that they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question whether the five months have changed something in the five months since their first discussion circuit, Rohini confirmed that things are slowly coming into the roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then listened again to the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it yet, but only when they are alone and are not members of family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two remains the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry on at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussionist know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the wedge to gain more freedom of movement or their own clothes-choice - at the end of a difficult to navigating the navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club does each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman comes home in the club and tell other people about what we talk and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginal groups in India and make videos about stories that will not report.</seg>
<seg id="1545">These stories are "News of those who are experiencing them," and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development claims.</seg>

<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who was interviewed exclusively in London in 1964, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this has enough to shoot the Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here turned out quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retailer Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikola Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning!! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan. in the case of 51 years ago they were in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "should represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the famous places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In fact, when you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you must visit absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (memorial in New York)</seg>

<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is The Beatles Day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked over Abbey Road.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The fall of the incarcerated Chinese Dissidents Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention to the international community after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was delivered to hospital due to liver cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for "Subversion" (state of citizenship) after launching a manifesto on democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius Fall as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a speaker he did not require to discuss this issue with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel laureates and his wife, poet Liu Xia, freeing or to allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely out of the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarized some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June, to discuss the fall of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesperson, however, refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to enable Liu abroad for a treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brenda have refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway was exhausted after the Nobel Peace Prize, after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded in Liu, although the Norwegian government assumed that this is ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were continued until in December last year. only in June Norway was signed an agreement to resume the race and went back to China, since the exports since 2010 were largely blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Having shared the message that Liu had seriously fallen ill, the Nobel Committee brought its hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick its price in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was not able to counter its price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On July 6th the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to free Liu and his wife immediately from the house arrest and permit him to seek medical support where he wants.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokesperson in the US Embassy in China, Mary, Polley, announced the message agency AFP on June 27th, that the message demanded the Chinese authorities to release not only Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "the US Embassy sent an angry answer from China to himself, with the exterior of the State Department, that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and have irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1656">Protection and liberty, such as travel to liberty and access to the medical care of its choice, to which they are entitled according to Chinese constitution and legal system, as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to impose the Chinese government on pushing Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20, in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Beijing report the news agency Reuters, that China had great concerns whether the vortex around Liu could overshadowed the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On June 28th, the Canadian Ambassador John McCallum, asked China to provide adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to move from his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius lawyer told AFP before that Lius wife, Liu Xia, who could visit him every day, but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to contact someone outside, including his lawyers, speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum tells us on:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls for China to safeguard its international human rights obligations, including free speech, to uphold and liberate the exercise of these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry requested China on 29 June to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo will get all treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. additionally his wife and his family can have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the message "" "" France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France will receive him in the end. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the landaffairs in Taiwan demanded China on 27 June to release Liu and pose a greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to promote political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese Lawgiers Yu mei-nu from the ruling Democratic Progress Party called for China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to treat themselves in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, showed herself very concerned in a statement on June 28th around Liu and gave him that many have asked him to pray for lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"" "" "" "it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished, to a harmonious, more stable and wealthy China could have contributed to a more peaceful world." ""</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, the Charter 08 marked, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized at the international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international law of the law firm in the State of New York, the Minister of State, that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore, since Singapore compared with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He is supporting Singapore as a city should be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the judiciary, "the logic to twist," in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrificing to create this valuable country, you hear that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the impression of a flight before the responsibilities, a mandatory breach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, Whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons given by Shanmugam trials were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore not with other 'normal countries', in view of its, it appeared inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">However, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently conducted by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once one reaches the core point of the theme, the good old lyre-keepers of the authoritarian rulers appear to be the Democrats, and abandoned its twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the final week, the answers to his American guests were given answers to their American guests regarding our press, the judiciary, our political system really non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions were asked with non-answers rational ways.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng promotes Shanmugam to show his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so in which country is part of our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I understand nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our cheaper K Shanmugam would take the effort to resolve this point, if it was paid high to be part of the city's government.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the reviews that one should begin to understand the entire co-ordinance of the conference so that the context of the statements of Shanmugam could be better understood, according to which Singapore was a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said, Singapore is more a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he said, why the elections in Singapore were so unequivocal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He met Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities did a party win for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said, Singapore" "" "is not a country," "" "he obviously does not meant it in that sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who acts as a leader of a growing generation, a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said, very much...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which awaits me - whether I disagree with them or not, but that is another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that he really believes and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review splitting the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Mr. Shanmugam "begged an error" or was it a Freudian speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">On my clear position then the default response follows: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook wardly against anger, if they are kept for Americans, but don't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian banner openly with their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already, when I began travelling around the world 20 years ago - Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>

<seg id="1771">Be harmless, inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">That can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things around one around.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go far, to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major property of Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1780">One in Thailand's famous pop band released a music video that the Junta parodizes, which took the power in 2014 and, in spite of their pledge the civil government, the country continues to uphold the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of which rules his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not expressly political, the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was an amazing success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days this was shared on Facebook uploaded video 1.254 times and received 8.800 pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month even the Charlie-Chaplin-Video "The dictator" was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to look at this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">You can interpret the video as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy, especially about how it behaves with the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Look at the videos of the video on some of the political issues that persists in Thailand for the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44" rules of the girls "may possibly refer to the drakonic section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which is given to the commander-in-Chief of the Heger, absolute decision-making on important national issues.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11. rule: "change your attitude" refers to the infamous program for "setting change" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other individuals who are considered by the junta as critics.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, its vague and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities in order to suspend activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also established in the army, which monitors on the online content and individuals, to whom the monarchy is slandered to have been prosecuted.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand is putting a stick set against "Lese Majest" (Majestätsinsult) by.</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, the war law was declared in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems pursued by the Junta is their decision to buy expensive U boats, although security experts warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payers.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video even shown how people will be thrown into a black van before they bring it into a detention centre, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison, because it supposedly causes "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long stipenalties, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the song of the band showing the Salut off "The Tribute of Panem" imitated that was already used by putsch opponents during the protest in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1804">The post-war society recovered only very slowly in East-Asia, especially in the district of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1805">It has now been over 20 years since the Georgian-Eurasian War was officially ended, but his scars are still visible in this part of the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The deserted villages of the northern district in Tsparchal show marked pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchiava are located in the coal-basin of AbchAsia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, shutters, Georgivers and Armenians lived and worked together to sojourned in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their houses during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, the largest part of Russians and wasteases are living in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in AbchAsia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people lived, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost cities.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic for Tsparchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the 16,000 people has risen since 2011, having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexer, a small woman with a coral-pink Brillenrollel and goldcolored ear rings in Teddy Bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mum Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a goal for Africans and Haitian, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 dollars a night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbled walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and haitician immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells people in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast to call them:" "" "Mama Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also slept on carton.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications they cannot pay, they masks them with a balm the exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, is arrived in a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama is a fair nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a joghurtche) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yeah," "" "reply with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao also travels with his sister who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have been living in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move toward the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard of other wayels from Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," said Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitian and the Africans often travel together the route and that the Africans were already talking to Whatsapp by Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet worked in Brazil before and worked as a building worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he has started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always keep in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez tells that her guests will often send text messages to her when they go away or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explained that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but her guests have brought her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only sparks hope for the migrants who travel through wallpaper.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valença.</seg>
<seg id="1937">During this winter, Valenzuela and his family were taken in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">It is a policeman and has found that the buses to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He began to help them get a reasonable price then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep at ceilings on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a hob outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests go through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had fled from him money in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to compose of him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a solo attraction, has offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and they try to decide where the next steps should go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses consult the travelers quiet their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">As a proud grandmother she hatched in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair-care that her has made her to her, some photos of her grandkids and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang, from Twitter users, in order to establish the '2000' degree '.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, a ethnic minorities region in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10 the mobile phones at Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a mobile phone call in which it indicates the district government to install an surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app is" "" "helping" "" "to get access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">But Cònaires will use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had installed the app, exchanged messages with a private Wechat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, that the App may determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, books and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is the blockages of pornography, from online fraud, Trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" state actors or even hackers allow to manipulate the home network of a person or stealing from it.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China focus mainly on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often darker for those working in remote, printed ethnic minorities such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in the conflict-areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures, as well as routinvenous Internet downcircuits.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media-based media outlets "Images from mainland China" (known in the US), the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where the police ed the indiscriminate on whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile phone call required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" ("" "" ing "" "" mode from China "" "" in the US), also published a Jingwang-product description, from which the software can lift the passwords request of a Windows operating system, and thus full access to the computer's hard drive. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computer and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang are possibly a reaction to the instructions of the city of Party, to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government offices, authorities and the associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obligated to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office using their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">An up-to-date report of Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi and to the 1st August its "personal ID card, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" register at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos, "but this action does not hurt the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and give them penalties for a whole host of other possible rewards, including those that refer to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The General Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he strokes to his canvas, sometimes to his computer, and again and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But to what people can leave is a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine watering lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top of his family house, which had been part of them since 1967; the year that Israel had completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as felahyees (approximately: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">Hdaib has been a passionate activist who watches the conservative majority and analysed her well-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian Arabs, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman Relativity, but also in cities that from Damascus in Syria are rich according to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years Hdaib when someone who isn't limited by boundaries in his thinking and he can suffer from its own statement with the people who suffer under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not open it openly, he puts a particular aversion against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees" - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I do not think about my own life circumstances," "" "stresses Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think this is because I am a man" while being shreated in water Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time, it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The former law also says that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking down with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hot young Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the dose of warm coffee and the wawaders of the Kent-cigarette is primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid fundamental things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink water - in order to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens has canceled a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentarians who support the Islamic State's Front - the jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country is contradictory and the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press secretary of the Islamic Coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was "" "" just "" "" because of the sexual orientation of the singer. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many believe that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism that question the old-approved legitimacy authoritarian regimes in the entire region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">"" "in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila, the" "" "progressive supporter of human rights" "", "which continues to stand for" "" "intellectual and cultural pluralism" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be easy to grasp rhetoric, but indeed an ever more evident crystallizing reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib's traditional Gender Standards on Leibe following his vision formed by the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The image shows the skeleton of a apparently low-comforting unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red sea; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives by the hands of those who they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, Jordan has increased the number of "Honorary murders" - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary murders in 2016 reached its peak; however, that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women, victims, victims or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on breakable control from 1954, women, who are exposed to risk of internal-family violence, "at an uncertain time in prison," and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort, as well as the guarantee on the part of the family is needed that the wife is nothing to happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to do not shy away themes that go long in his country as a tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is politically explosive, however, that he is his music, the full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot separate from politics.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Near East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was tripled in politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "lies the focus on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can continue to lead.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get, in his words, "which one wants," whether it is faith or non-believe, heterosexual, or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were to be deeply censored up in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular Prime Minister Roya, to remember later that his comments were torn from the context, and that his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but there was only a revised version," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib promotes the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentioned Abu Nuda, a poet of the eighth century, which has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuda, who would then work on behalf of the calibration, in the eighth century could write openly about homosexuality, why can Jordanier do not this?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Even recently, in January 2017, the Norwegian news service took a number of former government-ordered and members of the teacher association, with the reason why they expressed themselves critically on comments in social media to the problems that are deeply rooted in the country with deeply rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In the face of this the concert Hdaibs, according to that, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanian approach.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has drilled Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - it looks from slow, printed and internal changes. he is certain that these changes take place from day to day at the heart of the jordanic society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Finally, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he dreaming not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be inspired by music, art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not by bombs, round and artificial democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it has come, Hdaib will continue and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2150">These great, extravagant Warriors are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that there is a variant of Tanabata festivals that is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory means that the fortitude, the drums and the dancing over more than one thousand years were handed over, in the armies of the west of Japan in the northeast marched to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>

<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Peru), has led to become more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairstyles that can form these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity even has inspired an annual event, the competition of hair styling your "Batalla de Barberos," which is taking place since 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the version of the Beitrags" "" "commandment in guerrilla warfare" "", "which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love notes to people that we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not yet much more important to accomodate people who are coming down, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Precisely this question went to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Resliación (letters to reconciliation), young people to write letters to guerrilla warfare.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently, her country was showroom of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Colombian), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered the signing of the peace contract as such important that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos had received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombian, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerriers that lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out around the clock their weapons in themselves, they must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">"" "" "" "the Colombian society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must now record them in their ranks and support them in building a new life." ""</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian can join together and would have to help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love-ships in former guerrilla struggles to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla warfare - which should then be passed personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was created at the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Prize winner who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we love the people we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love notes, but those who forget that they need much unnecessary.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans, he told to share his love with people this year, which were most pressing.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and have to build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far, more than 2000 letters were collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is present in all major cities in Colombian such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on March 19 at one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota, to transfer the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done before to counter the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no precepts, but letters full of undermining people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," said the Political Scientisstudent Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an assistant of the governors of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After we passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerilla-fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla war) saw, I saw a guerrilla war that wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"" "" "" "I was afraid of responding, because next to him on the bed there was a MGL-Granatdesigner, a deadly weapon in the" "" "Sleeping" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "but I said to him nevertheless," "" "hello, what do they do?" "" "he answered," "" "I answered a letter I wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never in my life someone has written something like this, so I responded to it. "I suddenly walked the tears about the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him very firm and placed me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry to be the war, and was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighters, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life than war. he never had to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from hunger. "I never imagined that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society where you are waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "" "" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">Firstly, students and some leaders of the FARC came together at a panel discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already involved in the dark.</seg>
<seg id="2223">Therefore, the leader of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice from state to the whole Colombian people had experienced. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country more righteous.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard before, and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people, whom I have often seen as a monster and even had learned, even people with beautiful feelings were turned around, which were surrounded by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country is living, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the commander at the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">"" "" "" "the Colombian was prophesied, that after draining peace would reign." ""</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "as long as there is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take arms and protest for their rights. and this is completely justified (...)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy of no weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all defender of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology, they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last months there has been a sharp rise of suicides.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 saw the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from fear, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to pay the incapacity for his family, so Ahwazi-human rights groups, who want to work and remain anonymous in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video played on YouTube gave the moments after he had been ignited.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people made it quick to delete the flames again, and Moramazi was brought into the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the incinerations were so strong that doctors could not do anything more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide who has occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and campaigners on site warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights applied for this month some other - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussai and Shawn Bani Tamim - hanging.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family paternal who were helpless and impotent due to persecution by the Iranian government, who were helpless and capable of feeding their families and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the living in Iran living in the Arab Ahwazi community, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to challenge their living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly self-sufficient region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and began to end 1925 great efforts to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields, and some of the most valuable and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite this valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population barely gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime denied the Ahwazi Arabs and systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industry.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also has a variety of dams, built water from the Arab territory to the Persian regions, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region, and to destroy the local farming as well as fish and palm-trees.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Awarzi youth rose now to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Co-operation, work and social welfare, applied to 5% of Ahwazis who completed a job, finished elementary school, 55% an ongoing school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices, that the current situation, a mixture of poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination, "resulted in a" high rise "of the number of suicides under the young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "Dohimi said that especially unemployment has become worse. the reason for this is a combination of a high number of Ahwaz-coming ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the setting up process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functional and institutions should not set the Arab force, the local Arab Ahwazi will be dragging access to work possibilities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihoods outside of their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their pre- and surnames to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even the Arab name at the workplace will not be tolerated, let the voice of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the given circumstances which the Arab Ahwazi have to endure, human rights activist alarm, before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is difficult to determine how many women are really blabused, says Myrian González, scientist for genderask at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports, which do not even show up to the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District State Building 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was a question of violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were over 5,000 ads because of domestic violence during the peace of peace. there were 86% of the ads available here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads there were 40% of women that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the paraguayischen Women Activin Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are also displayed. "on each woman who is funded in Paraguay because of psychic abuse notification, come 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">On any woman who refunded due to physical failure, come two women who do not do this, "she said at the end of 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offender, the prosecution bodies cannot be properly documented, as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016 journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay were at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she did not want to do that, but she still had to regret.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today, Mariana 28 years old and no more with Carlos together. but for two years she bore mental violence on the one hand - one of the most frequent forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severely recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once again be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that the only women happened that are to subservient, because they are deceiving themselves from violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the missions by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without name, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during their two years relationship and told how he had insulated them.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people replied to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to confess that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and not left him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least had a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who comes not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner has been using them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrior 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned at all. this is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on site: for a lack of global healthcare, many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined have far more serious impact than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research, which is carried out by African scientists themselves, under construction of own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrior is Director of the centrallables at the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS-epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for studying in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania he explored even on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to assist the most effective health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as private individual).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: right now lies the focus of my work on the use of research results. I support the samabian National Programme for Antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This must change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being movers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are very well supported.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here, because funding and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research which you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: how is the public opinion about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is demand for special scientific training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The social sciences, computer science, big data, research of outer space, the health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often, there are limited speed, things to do and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which represent challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment (the so called "Paywall") limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" -seeds producers can change worldwide food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous plant, the first plant that is cultivated and consumed by NASA's Astronauts.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Almost 20 years Mortons has been working only through his own imagination and the question how many saline varieties can get, limits.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s he noted that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents protect not only for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green belt or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more of such patents have been registered on ever more plants like grain or cardboard boxes. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia tradition, Morton is still salad, but he still needs more because his work is always worth more and more limitations.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it's like going to lie in a river a rock that I have to repaddling.</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that this patents go far too far.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they withstand the court, no one can breed any more a new salad variety, because all the characteristics have already been patented. "he thus makes it as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and makes every effort to use no material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement which is getting bigger in the USA and everywhere in the world: open source poreding ("Open Source").</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have red red tube salat the "greenhouse" of the station and eaten. there it is tested that plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name seems rather like the movement from the IT sector, and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The open source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-source" -seeds) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, the alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was called into being to ensure that some plant species and not as intellectual property are protected and so that plant breeders are permanently usable.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US-breeder can pledge that others can use the seeds freely from them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">However, this doesn't mean that they do not continue to make business with their seeds and sell it. "open source" breeders permit only others who buy seeds to breed, and to breed it immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dismal outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeriated professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg have control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds still play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by doing seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement is not busy with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "those who want to buy good, local, and sustaining vegetables that are offered in August and September 2016, should also know that the way in which these vegetables are cultivated, is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutritionist without seed sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to providing all their seeds as well. this means that their procedures are opposed to patent well and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi-Supported argue that the future of food supplies would be jeopardized since the available gene pool is due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on the plant material, which is thus more limited to shrinking.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral work with a genetic variation with carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cardboard features are protected as intellectual property, making it accessible to plant breeders either at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants there are such estimates yet not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massacres built like wheat in an even bigger style are patented as salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred so that they are specifically designed features - of such by which their taste or colour improves to such circumstances, due to which they prospers in certain environments, and threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders with more and more patents decreases. genetic variety is currently necessary than ever since the changed conditions due to climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail Monsanto-Specherin Carly scaduto believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos' activities. with a total of four comrades and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company opted for the conservation of genetic variety.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts that the intellectual property restricts other breeders, since "patents and the protection of pesticide-diets innovations promote." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expires.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method for the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, it promotes, by public, it promotes more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: 20 years to wait until a patent baptism, is certainly not innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you need to wait so long to breed in plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources are always a general well, and they should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetular incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us forward and it will be impossible if we cannot continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in total revolt rose morton to the concept of itself, plant-features:" "" "we do not create the features themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them themselves out and as breeders, we finally have no idea how plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the U.S. State Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "who is a variety, breeding also breeding its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great hump and monocultures, for whose cultivation of herbicides are needed, serving in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very well-genetically." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized businesses (such that are moving to international markets but less than B. Monsanto are) patents possess the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they stop it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant-farmer Frank Morton looks for his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the view that breeders from the Avoid of Plant-makers were innovative: "it looks like I can produce something new with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I need constantly new material for my catalogue, since I know my competitors are selling my varieties within a couple of years ago, "he says." with a patent you are 20 years ahead of competition, with my opinion pretty simple makes.</seg>

<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "still, the Egyptian government content on the Internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it was the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August the Egyptian government documents the "Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) that documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"" "" "" "August, the network published an opinion on Facebook where it is sharply criticized by the Egyptian authorities for this step, and promised to continue the work and effort for human rights in the region." ""</seg>
<seg id="2725">The European Network for Human Rights Information remain unaffected in spite of this attack and the spotting of the Egyptian Right and the Constitution of the authorities, to uncover the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, even though it was never so difficult to pursue these goals, so it was never as important as it now. ANHRI was confirmed that all technical possibilities were exhausted, to overcome the block and not give us. we insists to keep our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked more than two months of 21 websites, as bas the independent news page MADA Masr, arabo-language edition of Huffington Post and the published network of Al Jazeera because of alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of side bullocks to the victim please. @ anhri one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, there is also no access to the blog of the columnists and Human Rights Reserves Ahmed Gamal Ziada, no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the spread of columnists and articles, which he does not write to open websites and media in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he erected in order to circumvent the censors of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider who is also resident to Ziadas blog, however, is even more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security guards during December 2013 and took a video on how police force bodily violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are based primarily about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada said to the blocking of the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The, blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfatted-Sisi priority; and even if the blockage of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is however for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was able to give me the feeling of a siege of siege; a arrest, a attempted murder, unloading of the National Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, after having blocked him and, that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The muetigen go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) of Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this will add technical tests to networks of various Internet service providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">AFTE also documented the blockage of vendors, which was possible through the relocation of internetworkship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, 12 of June we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of the government to block and filter content, which might have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated that the censors will be made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis to approach them in the court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants are arguing.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Newspapers will report a day of newspapers from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcards.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these lines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old are shot at school" "" "every second day, a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Diebe smoben pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sent 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air Force to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violence of 2017 in Rio has been the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organization Global Justice even called on the UN to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">For the detailed reporting of violence in Rio known newspaper "Extra" on 16th August the editorial, "This is not normal" in which they announced, a new category called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that happens from the civilised standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the heading "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists are not engaged in our eyes before the cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only daily newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">The same video explains a reporter of the newspaper, that according to data provided by the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are criminals that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial writes the newspaper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">"" "" "" "we are aware that a war" "" "war" "" "if it is distorted to also be used, cruises of the police, who shoots and then ask questions to cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose purpose is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">The name "War" is more than its useful?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil argues the journalist Cecília Oliveira to designate the violence as a "war." this is their opinion a justification of failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police accountable.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and worse planning - like extra in the analysis of the military deployments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-counterfuse of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília is wrong: "22 of the 30 non-violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 to the north and north-east of the country. these are the most recent data available.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">When we look at the Mordrates per state, Rio is on place 16, "she writes.</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to the company Globo, the largest media company of South America, which, such as Cecília, has been emphasized since years the security policy of the state.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Among these security policy measures also belonged to the establishment of UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), one of the State of Rio in 2003, which aims to conquer a massive police force in favela and permanently stationed there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a withdrawal of violent death deaths. however, for several years, the UPP ought to protect itself after several reports on Shikanen and repressions against poor congregations that should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under attack.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux from one of his articles published in 2010, in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio has also serious consequences for the human being.</seg>
<seg id="2786">"" "for this calls for the state to use the means and ways that are typical for a war. in addition, the intrusion into the territory of a" "" "enemy" "", "for which a civil war is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for" "" "palateral defects" "" "and" "" "warped balls" "".

<seg id="2787">War one or her, fact is that the people of favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>

<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition remain on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of Assad regime has been practised.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, those of rebels controlled regions outside of Damascus have stood under siege that caused inhabitants to be relied on the local or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Traditional foods such as meat has become unreachable for large parts of the population.</seg>

<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional ones in Syria planted foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive food source for many people of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Director of the project, Abo Nabil, said against the French news agency AFP:</seg>

<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died, and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government spent the last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires also were registered in the Galicia region where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 garries outbreaks, spread abroad in the northern and centrally located regions of the country, and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>

<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems comes that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as local people seek information or attempted to contact persons, go offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that caters the population with information: you took advantage of your own civilian defenders with the application fogos.pt and inform the people in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of fire brigade and was taken at this fateful weekend in October so that the servers of the landing of the 400,000 users who watched the fires: while the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2885">The Taliban taken for their hatred of the Hazara-Taliban were ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">Some days after his flight, Ashark found himself again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coherence. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of its low money and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortar, which were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>

<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application, Achieaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time was Achieaf homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day of relief to the needy.</seg>

<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it also ergate acts.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But its irrepressible vivious helped ascarve to liberate itself from these conditions soon.</seg>

<seg id="2920">However, Asharafs goals reach far beyond the Italian food industry and the retail and aim to go back to the country which he had to be forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
