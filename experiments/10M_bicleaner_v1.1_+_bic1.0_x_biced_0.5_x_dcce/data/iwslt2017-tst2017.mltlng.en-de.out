this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New @-@ York Times .
long before someone heard about Edward Snowden , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he posted spect@@ ac@@ ularly that the NSA heard illegal telep@@ hon@@ ors of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation which was literally dra@@ fted into the CIA to Iran for an atomic bomb .
if this sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know , whom the chapter has not been liked ?
the US government .
for almost 10 years the government has identified against R@@ isen and called him to call it his alleged sources .
in this move , he became the symbol of the pattern of the government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , and journalists to pun@@ ish .
according to the first constitutional pronoun@@ cement media the media has the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they offer .
so when the government at R@@ isen ank@@ ake , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison .
but then , just days before the process , something exceptional happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they had some years of information it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government officials were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porter and resources can be hidden less and less .
instead of failing to fail and bring cr@@ acks to the statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without its consent , his phone calls , are secretly concerned ,
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit card , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information they found evidence which they used to judge Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , an CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens supposed source .
unfortunately , this is just one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his head . but instead , the judiciary has judged more than all U.S. governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has led too much of its work than secret .
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers went to a journalist .
so we set the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional claim , because the government has more possibilities to comp@@ ose all of them .
but just as technology of the government allows to byp@@ ass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ spect , in the testimony .
today there are communication software that has not yet been written as an ann@@ ul@@ ing his book and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send documents , just as in any ordinary contact form .
these are encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the respective target agency .
so the government can no longer retrieve information and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ drop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are getting new Spi@@ on@@ age@@ Technologies , who je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us all .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technological expert such as Edward Snowden have a chance to express mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers .
the lack of abnorm@@ alities in the care of soldiers is modest and will tell of crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who suggests alarm to contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a pilgri@@ m @-@ in@@ sider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis .
nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of the story published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; indicates that Rei@@ che and patron &#93; was hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness about an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents related to the law firm in Panama &apos;s law firm Mos@@ ch Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers will go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad envel@@ oping firms in tax hav@@ ens .
it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ists .
now there will be a lot richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release , and to the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of a agency or an John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems cri@@ es from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we handle what ?
but the truth is , when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens , and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and it concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations have been phenomenal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens will be used by some few to hide and conce@@ de their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing ourselves for ten years .
I think many people seem very confusing all over the world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones .
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is .
I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the US .
presumably because there were no prominent Americans now that occurred in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
now , it is not that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
but by the principle , according to which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers .
if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , it is the fact that in some U.S. countries you need less information to specify less information to start a company as a reference ID .
this type of lack of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school departments , school children to gam@@ ble .
it has che@@ aters allowed to rip particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ators found themselves as a African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked that all proposals were made up to a lawyer by our investig@@ ators as he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were all pre@@ mat@@ ures . none of these lawyers participated as clients , and of course anyone has been handed down to anyone , but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important to consider this not as an item .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who made proposals to our uncovered investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leader , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about how the system operates through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability .
and to cope with this , we must change the rules .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior .
this may sound very comfor@@ ting as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful .
but as borrowed optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
in the last few years we have witnessed increasing transparency and more transparency , regarding the owners of companies .
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU is captured in central reg@@ isters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and global .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind head@@ firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in economics that rise up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to stop laws that type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can end the transparency that now offers this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s the story , as I once had been kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da have landed .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a res@@ ale selling .
a guy in the Red Maz@@ da stayed there and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip all the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where would you sle@@ w it tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he said he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really does it . I don &apos;t want to kidn@@ apping in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air @-@ rat . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed to the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh Mann ! what have I broken me there ?
a game @-@ alien in my living room .
what if he is crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I rose out of bed , jour@@ ne@@ h to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not mad .
we are still in contact .
the artwork , which he had bought from me , depends today in his classroom . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewpoint .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ?
places people on my air mattresses was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattresses .
let &apos;s take a jump , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate moves out and the rent will be increased .
I knew that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , who could make something like this . our apartment will stay with a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded like &quot; air mattresses and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we were farewell to our last guest and the door to the castle fell , the Brian and I joined .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
the things came into roles .
my former fellow @-@ dwell@@ ers , N@@ ate Ble@@ ch@@ czyk , joined us as developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
in this way , we presented our Invest@@ ors : &quot; we want to create a website where people open public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors you take when you visit .
over the internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
indeed , they do not .
nobody , who is still at con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people .
why ?
because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
when you have a problem you are spinning on the things that you can do . we were able to design .
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before .
can design afford it ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample , what degree can we trust .
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
Thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left seat .
this quietly att@@ acking from panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time .
for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your text message , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the mobile phones of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just like that , who has actually Al Gor@@ es mobile phones ?
could you proc@@ laim it to Twitter that he is member of the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a small detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had only once presented with his name ; if he had told where he comes , how his dog or his children are hot ?
imagine you would have 150 evaluations , all that say : &quot; he really can hold very well im@@ mobil@@ ised mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ covered feedback system reinfor@@ ces trust .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to prevent negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their evaluations before we presented them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probable it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are with regard to age and residence .
little surprising we trust the people most , who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bi@@ ases .
exciting becomes it if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through evaluations .
if you have less than three evaluations , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything is changing .
a good reputation is similarities .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on how much one can expect from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if one tells too little , as for example &quot; hi ! , &quot; you get no answer .
tell us a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother -- - the request is not accepted rather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ olle works &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in your apartment ! I make holidays with my family holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create design to make this level of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds up the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers .
with what we had not reck@@ oned , the large amount of people who were more than willing to prevent these prejudices .
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been covered before .
for us the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have been un@@ allowed parties or have desol@@ ated dwell@@ ings .
hosts have a stay in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than this calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve .
fortunately , from the 123 million were only a fraction of the problem .
for people trusted each other to law .
when trust does work , it can create wonder .
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host took him to the hospital .
he even pointed blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travellers looking for sitting activities on heart attack .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian saint , who can save life , even though they do not know a real time .
you will go to the hospital in your own car when you die , and wait while you get a byp@@ ass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they can even stay longer without having to calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course does not run every stay .
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ cription are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share of Economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is here about an economic trade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is just now just &quot; hiring industry &quot; but the thing doesn &apos;t do justice to it .
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves openly and this changes everything .
if you travel nowadays , this is fast food to compare . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if tours would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group there would be Ans@@ äs@@ sle@@ ger to show you a thoroughly fill and one in a Knei@@ pent@@ our district which one has never heard before ;
or when you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
these days apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from scratch to share one another ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of sharing a common part ?
I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul this project has already begun . many parking spaces which the government had belonged ,
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were pulled out . there have been incub@@ ator programs ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 million people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreig@@ ner or even host .
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was attached to us .
we did not re@@ invent the wheel .
hospitality was also before .
there were already similar sites in front of us .
so why did our work just ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome profound prejudices .
I find this intrigu@@ ing ,
quite overwhelming .
I must contem@@ plate on it every time a red Maz@@ da is over by me .
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon .
thanks .
what do you think about when you look at me ?
one believers ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , an bra@@ in@@ washing , a terrorist threat ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslims : it is great to meet you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ ker @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , Baby , I was not born this way .
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old , I met my decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as homo@@ sexual human , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ ine . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head@@ gear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same thing was : at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and with the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and in@@ accessible beauty ideal .
I have not only adopted the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Koran .
I read it , thought after , asked in question , doub@@ ted and believed ultimately .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to tears .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody percei@@ ves you , you fully understands , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels like that .
later I married and began how all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then there was that horrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had too late , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; em@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes in buildings , people sp@@ urs out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into indign@@ ation quickly .
why should you do something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Zer@@ bom@@ bed Mecca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh , my God .
it &apos;s not only my country attacked but in the N@@ u changed me the deeds of others from a civil war in one susp@@ ects .
on the same day we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying .
I remember how we drove me -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as Mus@@ lim@@ ine .
we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; be vigil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d war@@ ms &quot; , &quot; lead in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; cu@@ ing you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims meet for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings issued : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who held free to Muslims and struck .
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who had attacked this land have attacked our country .
I have been offen@@ ded the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain themselves .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and join mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ignant tumor to be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ aid and Olympi@@ as .
will make the closing of mos@@ ques America safer ?
there may be some parking spaces free but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mosque leads to contem@@ plate people of other faith and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington region , DC recently told : people are actually not for@@ ci@@ ble in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it is starting online . as a result , the person is cut off by her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ mist@@ ress can make the extre@@ mes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ises her behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we need to keep people going to the mosque .
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to her imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology for their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if one casts a look at it , it is not driving what she read in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently a amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . each cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke , she brought the silence and told her that her anger , her sense for the injustice in the world , she would only bring into trouble .
of nothing inspired and something that had given sense to her anger , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization of extremis@@ ts , which they promised a solution .
this Ima@@ m introduced the link to God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using it for her anger , he showed her constructive ways to a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mosque , she shou@@ ted to join the IS before the IS .
it was an insight that concerns the Islam@@ ophobia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect every other ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , happen at least three things .
we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and prejudices .
a study shows : when people report reviews , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they vote rather military attack on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you look at when the mood against Muslims rise above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two constitu@@ encies .
so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural response to mosquito @-@ terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to exploit the foundations of free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear spreads us all .
in the assignment of collective inno@@ c@@ ence , it is not just about having to explain themselves .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was a athlete .
he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person , whom she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his resume . she was ast@@ o@@ unded and said ,
&quot; when is from my frat@@ ernity become such an accomplished young man ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he f@@ lowed eight times to De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
when we went to the mosque or we were safe at home ?
we captiv@@ ate it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear or one in which we can exercise our religion free .
we decided for the mosque .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove exhau@@ st , with high pressure to the mosque .
I took him out , my shoes went out , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me hold .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked his guests , as half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers , and non @-@ believers who have come to attack us , but to assist us .
in that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there , because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go to number secure ?
or will you join those who mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : well , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who may be claiming that you &apos;re holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with deep underground , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
if you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever performed study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any respect .
if people seem as an exception to rule , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for Bast@@ ler is near@@ ing a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . can be made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air package integration into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es .
surrounded by co @-@ ordinate aircraft , high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly up@@ loaded structures .
you have learned to bear loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of Pos@@ sible in the autonomous flight .
so that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must be collective , where in the room the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . that allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculations on board , what the machine should do .
external commands can be found at the highest level , e.g. , &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a cap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance @-@ driving force , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
as opposed to most star@@ ters it can float float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is highly versatile .
however , there is always a downside .
a limitation of con@@ ta@@ gious is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind turbines .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in whatever location the optimum position can be recovered and improved performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often provide basic abstract issues that are prevalent at the core of the matter .
one such question would be for example : what is the smallest amount of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known as machines with a thousand moti@@ on@@ able parts , which gather together to viol@@ ate you .
several decades ago @-@ trained pilot devices could fly away @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two mobile parts : a prop@@ eller and a ta@@ eck@@ ar .
un@@ long discovered we discovered that flies with just one works .
this is the moon , the mechan@@ ically easiest hand @-@ used flight device . it was invented short ago .
it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ator or chec@@ kers , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life very much , so that it can fly stable and move around in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to bring it to flies , I have to throw it exactly correctly .
the chance to throw it exactly right when everyone can watch , is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
when the moon is a exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symm@@ et@@ rical .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in alignment .
by doing so he gets the greatest ability ,
moving in the space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rotating .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ers .
some can be trac@@ ed in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s see that on .
when flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they need to be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is composed of two separate two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is rotating in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
does not go wrong - a motor or prop@@ eller is falling out , the electronics or a battery , the machine can fly further , albeit restricted .
we will now demonstrate that we make half air@@ worthy air@@ worthy .
the last demonstration expl@@ ores synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we participated in southern micro @-@ squares -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully , you motivate those demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine there , I want to be running on Broadway a flying lamp@@ shade .
of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
for types like us , the wage is in the development and the production of creativity .
it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
1,3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are getting faster , they turned so the mass of three son@@ nen in a tenth of a second in pure energy around .
this short moment it turned bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
however , they do not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into the space @-@ time texture itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we arrange the events at first time .
1,3 billion years ago was the most recent life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rs , humans and -- God stood at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group especially courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss approved by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - to build a huge laser code in order to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ di@@ zing black holes .
most of them thought it was crazy .
but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O - the laser @-@ interfer@@ om@@ etry - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves Observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up time the precision of LIG@@ O was significantly increased , which improved the impact performance enormously .
therefore , we are now calling him Advanced LIG@@ O .
at the beginning of September 2015 LIG@@ O was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems .
on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ zing black holes are through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the goodbye from my death @-@ sick father .
basically , they were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist am MIT . he has been investig@@ ators for 23 years of vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observatory such as LIG@@ O measurable signals . what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cr@@ ashing in the fabric of space and time .
at the passing wave the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction , and into the other stri@@ ves .
to illustration , lec@@ tur@@ ers in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead a true neutral dance .
&quot; stretch and storage , stretching and st@@ ow@@ sing . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous .
on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched to the waves of the waves and pun@@ ches . the stretching of an average person was 10 @-@ 21 .
this is called 20 n@@ ul@@ len after comm@@ a , followed by 1 . Dar@@ um explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy .
with a five kilometers long laser Det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of a atomic nucleus . that is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gravity .
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LIG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are tremendous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ c@@ ists are tricky and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott holds gladly , LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite handy . for this way , you can make a picture or a map of things by looking at the light around you from multiple points .
in pots it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that &apos;s why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that will give you a lot of things :
the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain properties like tape and height , rhythm and volume to close to the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now is just Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob &quot; .
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least it is essential for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
so if we convert wave pattern in dro@@ ms , we can hear that all literally .
the gravity out of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
S@@ H : two black , not rot@@ ting holes , circul@@ ate simple : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same circul@@ ate with an additional key change . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a type of motion , shaped in the wav@@ e@@ form .
AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; Jem@@ and , who knows what to hear , recognises this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ fold sun@@ mass , which turn around as fast as the sticks of your bl@@ ender .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the most dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 others , the other with a mass of 36 others , orbit each one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O has an entirely new way to investigate the universe , as it was never before possible .
on this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not visible .
a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ting stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical operations occur however at the core , which is hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron , carbon and silic@@ on .
we will never go through , since this op@@ ak are .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Ur@@ qui@@ z : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the Ur@@ b@@ ang is vei@@ led by its own light .
with the use of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before and we have no idea at all . things that we only see by listening .
indeed , LIG@@ O found equally in the first attempt things we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of LIG@@ O @-@ Project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars , which produces black holes , like LIG@@ O it , are the dinosau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the sauce for our archaeological work .
LIG@@ O offers us a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately the way we went out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circul@@ ate of the cosmos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new observatory -- a whole new generation of Observ@@ atories on Earth and in All . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the urine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now is the time of great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of what I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous to me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say Yes .
would I speak in public opinion ?
no , but yes !
wanted to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the swing ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just what I was doing before I was afraid , eliminating my fear .
my fear to hold speeches , my social fear -- bu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain Yes that changed my life deeply , on an un@@ expec@@ tedly . it started with a question of my youngest .
I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls out of in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estimate , I need milk for my beak @-@ up . &quot;
she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go , and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
that Yes was the beginning
a new attitude in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them always once you are asking me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I am not perfect , but I felt very much .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently , I understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ wing to play with my children was saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things emerge , send it to life .
dre@@ am@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I cre@@ ased television . I manufacture television .
I am making TV , in big style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours to the world in the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
every program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV sen@@ ders can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode all nine days by four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three shows , which are at the same time : 24 episodes : know To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours of television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series run together on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are ship@@ ments that I have created myself , and not only produces . I have to find time , really sti@@ lle , creative time to gather my fans around bon@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , wareh@@ ouses that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes it ?
nobody , so I am a Titan .
dre@@ am@@ job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; fall .
I say to you , so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company , a country or a class@@ rooms , take a business or a classroom , so you understand that I &apos;m not just sitting on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say , I understand that it is not going to dream about dreams .
it &apos;s all a job , everything work , all reality , all blood , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am deep@@ ened in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it &apos;s like I put troops on , as painted me on a canvas .
so as to get a high tone , lie@@ fe a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , sound@@ ly and rational , cru@@ el@@ ly and rational . and the best thing is money .
there is such a change in me if the work is running well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums it sounds like a busy road , I could always drive to her .
many people assume that when I tell them the bu@@ zz that I &apos;m writing my writing that writing me joy .
do not understand me wrong , that does it .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began working with television production when I began working and work and work , to create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the money is more than writing .
the money is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the money is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the money is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you cannot do otherwise than by size .
the feeling , not to be different than looking for size , no matter what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I just know I &apos;m not going to fail for failure , and I just know I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to put it into question .
to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work more at the same time , the more watching me , the more I write history , the more expectations there .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what do I say about work ?
I love working , not true ?
the land , which I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high clay , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the money .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I only this bu@@ zz ?
and then the bu@@ zz stops .
revised , over@@ lap , exaggerated , spread .
the bu@@ zz stops .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single worker .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
and Emer@@ son says , &quot; estimate , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot;
it is the children of an Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ ti@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sums were heard .
the amount of the engine died .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the money did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours days , worked out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ue , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps , there is not , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ shop@@ pers from the author @-@ Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know , you do , you are doing a teacher to be a teacher , a banker to be a mother , a boy , Bill Gates , you just got a different one and that gives you a bu@@ zz when you knew the sums it feels when the sums stopped , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I put my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she was not calling me &quot; estimate . &quot;
it calls anyone more &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz , and here everything is changing from my own eyes .
and so she says , &quot; mom , do you play ? &quot;
and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the Sum@@ mer@@ ing , I can do nothing except to match .
I am focuss@@ ed .
I am quiet .
the land , which I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , aler@@ ts , and the song in which it goes on to let go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The ice r@@ ink &quot; let go .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me trig@@ gers .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
and that is not right away , but it happens .
I feel it .
the money is slowly coming back .
no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the bu@@ zz , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz , the working environment , the tit@@ anium @-@ sum@@ mons that is just the replacement .
if I wonder who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums it is .
the money is not strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real money is dependent on love .
the money is the current that comes from lust .
real money is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of the history , the task of completed tasks , the expectation and the pressure .
the real money is simple and original .
the real money is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan &apos;s ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes .
I am doing this as a solid rule , so I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear it again .
I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not possible to do so , how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working as home at the workplace .
this conc@@ ession is painful , because what a person does rather work than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we ro@@ de in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ attered soap @-@ bub@@ bles .
thereby I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused .
I am always afraid of my mobile phone .
yet it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we quit playing with the games ?
you can also do it ! say she always Yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you stop me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amy .
you will probably be right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you also know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show character .
your child finds you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they di@@ gest , that they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ ans@@ k or Ke@@ ks replaces me .
and speak my teen@@ ager every 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , more needs it not need .
every one can catch 15 minutes in a piece , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile , no clothes , no distr@@ action .
the day is short : dinner , the kids are praying .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the sums of money to have a place for his soul peace .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it is about joy ,
around the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
allow yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and store it .
I am not perfect in it . I failed and I victories . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just stand for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not have a full 15 minutes indul@@ ge ?
what can be wrong anyway ? nothing !
the money came back in my spare time . the sums it seems to go back when I did not work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again . I listen to an un@@ familiar melody , it fills me and my soul . she temp@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it in full moves and love my job again .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I do not love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the money is not me ... no more .
soap P@@ ases and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends .
this is now my bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the bu@@ zz of love .
the money of the work is part of me , but just one part . and for this I am so grateful .
it is clear to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan , the journey to Jerusalem .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires still burn .
the more I play , the happier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land which I created , the marathon , I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the amount , the sums , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel of this sums , the more this unusual , inspir@@ ational , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think things from , I get you down to life .
that belongs to the job , which means to live his dream .
that is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
I said yes &apos; to less work and more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am Neuro@@ surgical in .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how to change your life from one second to another , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has very small capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a sustained , heavy disability .
this is probably the reason why I got functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
they certainly have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in this regard , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neur@@ ons so that neurological function is improved .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease that suffered under fierce trem@@ bling and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time , I was managing director and working day and night in the emergency .
often I gave patients with skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma the brain is s@@ wimm@@ ers and the cran@@ ial pressure .
to save life , you have to decrease the cran@@ ial pressure .
to do this , you sometimes have to remove some of the clouds brain .
instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to allow cells from a tissue to grow , comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environments to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed Jean @-@ François .
this saw him under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ unterricht that stem cells un@@ ripe cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small nav@@ y of the brain .
it is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they slowly split up slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
so we saw a new , strange cellular population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different .
we needed for a long time to understand where they came .
these are from these cells .
these blue and red cells are hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make 4 % of our grand@@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ se cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations , near brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows bra@@ ins .
we had to prove this .
so , we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to see a piece of brain from the non @-@ lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean @-@ François .
and then , simply highlight them , to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we re@@ pl@@ ung@@ ed it to the de@@ file of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ised Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reproduce these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in imp@@ lied brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we realized the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared , as if they were taken again , they go back home . the space is occupied already , they will not be used there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added an injury to and re@@ im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells receive -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been im@@ planted .
the proof that they show are these little points . these are the cells , which we ro@@ wed in vit@@ ro , in the culture .
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we have monkeys with a manual destiny .
they had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very well .
when they had reached a stable level of skill , we injured in the motor@@ ic cor@@ tex .
ther@@ eu@@ pon the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand .
just as it would happen with people , they reco@@ vering spontaneously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plasti@@ fic@@ tional brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side they see the monkeys that reco@@ vering spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from infringement .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
now let &apos;s see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same ape , two months after the im@@ plantation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and later use them .
we can use them in other neurological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to im@@ planted them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that even now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on human beings .
Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . proceeding from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to do this study with a small group of patients .
it has been a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study .
one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting us and told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to look at them as granted .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which it is in reality , but as a inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing ge@@ ance .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have doub@@ ted that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not the austerity programmes that have been implemented in Greece .
at this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my un@@ due friends who told me that democracy would have abolished , if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group , we believe we could save democracy , but that we need a true and defen@@ cel@@ tic democracy .
because without democracy our societies are common , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies wasted .
regarding the waste of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies .
I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and know him as the debt mountain , who casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we are all recognizing the debt of debt ,
yet only few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is , however , is too anxious to invest in there where it would be productive and in@@ comes , with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3.4 tri@@ llion US dollars were invested in the USA , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ llion US dollars worth a lot of money , until you compare it with the $ 1 tri@@ llion in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do , except the stock exchange rates and the property prices are highly accurate .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital make up the twin summit , which are not equal by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ nating wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low demand fear@@ ing the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors resulting from fear , the prophecy of the ear , would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow .
un@@ question@@ ing the circumstances that cause them to k@@ ills it .
this is my ha@@ des with capitalism --
his exce@@ ed@@ ling capital All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be an error , the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these out@@ crop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive role in the ath@@ arian democracy was and is that it gave up the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech , but more important and more important to them , giving them the right to political co@@ determination with the same bal@@ ancing of equal rights issues .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not long lasted for a long time --
like a candle , which is very bright , it is also fast re@@ marked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our times of liberal democracies are not their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the liberal democracy came only when a full separation between politics and economics is possible and the democratic process has been limited to politics , while the economy - i.e. the world of corporations - a democratic free zone was established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in our present @-@ day democracies has begun since the time that this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two , and the economy is gradually im@@ migr@@ ated to politics .
do you wonder why politicians are not as much as before ?
it is not part of a de@@ generation of their DNA .
it is because you cannot be in the government days , and still does not believe in power , because the power of politics is emigr@@ ated to the economy and which areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
when you think about it , it is about such a herd of beasts that are so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they are nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end .
it is similar to the economy that politics emerged as far as the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful of capitalism distri@@ butes &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; out of democracy , the higher the Twin Towers , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the wealth of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to restore politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; control the control , as in the antique Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and wast@@ age .
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage s@@ ain@@ ting with automation and robots .
the problem is that , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin @-@ up summit will be higher , the wast@@ age of the wealthy , and the social conflicts are deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China will come .
so we must re@@ organise the economy and re@@ united the areas of economy and politics , and take care of the re@@ unified field otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that can appear as a documentary film &quot; matrix &quot; as a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth to survive --
&quot; &quot; &quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or by something that the society in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that people use their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a long talks to the meaning of life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
so what would do it like , how could it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like Utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples soon .
in the field of companies , please choose a capital market , where you earn money while you work and in which your funds will follow you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who &apos;re currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and from exhaus@@ tion and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work at them , and employees working there , which the company does not belong . no exchange between capital and labour , no major gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no more productive twin @-@ ins .
in the area of global political economy , please pose just before that our national currencies would have a free hesit@@ ant exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest prevalence &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call them &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial excess of the respective country , into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investments are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
today , we , particularly in front of the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ate , in which it fav@@ ored privileged people , and Marxist , because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esi@@ as , global ke@@ g@@ onal .
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide to work together in common .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratically .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do not do it , technological development will produce such a massive decline in economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers were referred to as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabil@@ ise our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ alistic democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like key@@ nes , and therefore I am also totally ra@@ ging .
BG : in fact , and now we are at ease .
Y@@ V : if you are not in@@ hospitable , you think not enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you told very clearly what you hold from the point of view of the West in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal democracies , we have the form of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of it plays , -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I can say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
because -- remember - we tend to re@@ connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can be observed in China now , resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now throw out what the West has done in the 19th century to act viol@@ ently to hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ ener are curious about your experiences as the Greek finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I reiter@@ ated that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half of six months ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal standpoint , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning ,
not only Greece , but the euro zone ,
namely to adopt us from self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the lasting denial is that massive degra@@ dation line has passed through the euro area and continues to reach a massive threat to the development of the entire European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which , by the way , was the first proposal to revealed this denial --
it is true . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the European group , continue to be elected .
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try a business system which is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , one perhaps can delay it a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what change are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a tense situation , he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person .
naturally , I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
they merely wanted to bring our government to the USSR , only because they did not want to deal with the objec@@ tions created by the euro zone .
they did not want to confess that they had been cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
worse than during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika &apos;s creditors , imposed by this policy , has stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tro@@ duction of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the liber@@ ated fli@@ ers will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not only have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to indicate the way of post @-@ modern 1930 , what it seems to me , it will be as detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TED .
Y@@ V : thanks .
by Roy Price most of them have never heard , although it is likely to be responsible for 22 @-@ min@@ ating minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios ,
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV @-@ series that Roy did not choose any one .
he has to find shows , which are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner .
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV @-@ series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the rating runs from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review .
if your show is rated at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows , like &quot; Breaking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addic@@ tive , where , after having looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left side , here on this end , shows are like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- which should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it makes more thoughts about the middle out@@ pouring , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not delight .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available and of course it is the first time Amazon makes such a thing , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk nothing .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he is holding a contest .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects through an analysis of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can look at all free of charge .
and if Amazon releases some stuff , then it is up to , right ?
millions of spectators look at these episodes .
however they don &apos;t know they will be observed when watching these shows .
they are being observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when to start the show when you pause , which parts you start or look at once again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process these and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
do anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show because they were not so good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House is estimated at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
at the same time at another company , another manager took place a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always searching for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it but it makes it different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews that they give the shows , their time , which shows they like etc .
then use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators but a drama series on a Senator .
know the show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has ended up a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives a 9.@@ 1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data rever@@ ted companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic somehow states that that should work with everything .
if one collects millions of data to make a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision .
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you are optimized by a very powerful computer .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , or ?
when data analysis does not work so this is something start@@ ling because we live in a time in which we will gain more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you will be in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be real bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence for this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data sanc@@ tified companies are sometimes wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
2009 gave Google known that by data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way can pre@@ dict -- by data analysis of the Google research .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news @-@ sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ less , year round year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data can be accomplished , such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life -- in the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine .
so we &apos;d prefer to make sure that data is helpful .
also I know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ ma@@ gin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I realised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things :
as a first , you place this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items above ; as a wide range , you put the items again together to grasp a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help sh@@ it a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suited to re @-@ comp@@ ose the parts once more and then come to a decision .
this is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put together parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to then get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and mind where they are also in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , why they would otherwise not have been able to understand , but the decision on how to take all of these parts , once again put up a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that was not in the data .
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their choices , first as they are we@@ ather@@ ed by TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; that tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , it was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ ar or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will fight it later with a technology demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in retro@@ spect on the ball .
but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more cl@@ oned , like data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the base structure .
so perhaps the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions , if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data still pays out to make decisions , an expert in what you do and take risks .
because at the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve .
thanks nice .
