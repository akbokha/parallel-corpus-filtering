<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New-York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before someone heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he posted spectacularly that the NSA heard illegal telephonors of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation which was literally drafted into the CIA to Iran for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If this sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know, whom the chapter has not been liked?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has identified against Risen and called him to call it his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this move, he became the symbol of the pattern of the government, whistleblowers, and journalists to punish.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the first constitutional pronouncement media the media has the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media cannot get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mud that they offer.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government at Risen ankake, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something exceptional happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they had some years of information it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government officials were dropped." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporter and resources can be hidden less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to fail and bring cracks to the statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without its consent, his phone calls, are secretly concerned,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit card, and even travel-wise with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information they found evidence which they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, an CIA Whistleblower and Risens supposed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is just one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his head. but instead, the judiciary has judged more than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has led too much of its work than secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblowers went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we set the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional claim, because the government has more possibilities to compose all of them.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology of the government allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the testimony.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet been written as an annuling his book and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the website of Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send documents, just as in any ordinary contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are encrypted and stored on a server that only has access to the respective target agency.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer retrieve information and many of the information they would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">Securedrop is only a small part of the whole to protect freedom of press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are getting new SpionageTechnologies, who jeopardizing us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technological expert such as Edward Snowden have a chance to express misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers.</seg>
<seg id="39">The lack of abnormalities in the care of soldiers is modest and will tell of crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who suggests alarm to contaminated water from Flint. or a pilgrim-insider that warns us ahead of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">Nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016, the largest data leck of the story published.] [the "Panama Papers" indicates that Reiche and patron] was hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer by Global Witness about an explanation.] this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents related to the law firm in Panama's law firm Mosch Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers will go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad enveloping firms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot richer people out there and others who are nervous about the next release, and to the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of a agency or an John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems cries from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we handle what?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is, when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens, and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And it concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations have been phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens will be used by some few to hide and concede their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing ourselves for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing all over the world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones.</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because there were no prominent Americans now that occurred in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now, it is not that there are no rich Americans that hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle, according to which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is the fact that in some U.S. countries you need less information to specify less information to start a company as a reference ID.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of lack of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school departments, school children to gamble.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has cheaters allowed to rip particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigations into the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigators found themselves as a African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that all proposals were made up to a lawyer by our investigators as he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">These were all prematures. none of these lawyers participated as clients, and of course anyone has been handed down to anyone, but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an item.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who made proposals to our uncovered investigators." ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it is not about a single leader, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">It is about how the system operates through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we must change the rules.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very comforting as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as borrowed optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have witnessed increasing transparency and more transparency, regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU is captured in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the U.S. and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they can see how other people can hide their true identity behind headfirms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need executives in economics that rise up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and use it to stop laws that type of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together, we can end the transparency that now offers this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">That's the story, as I once had been kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazda have landed.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a resale selling.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the Red Mazda stayed there and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip all the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where would you slew it tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I do not know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he said he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really does it. I don't want to kidnapping in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard myself saying," "" "I have an air-rat. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "one voice in my head said," "" "äh," "" "how to ask?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared to the ceiling and thought: "Oh Mann! what have I broken me there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A game-alien in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I rose out of bed, journeh to the door, and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork, which he had bought from me, depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Places people on my air mattresses was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattresses.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate moves out and the rent will be increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I knew that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can make it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, who could make something like this. our apartment will stay with a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded like "air mattresses and Breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattresses on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham Omeletts tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them all the city. when we were farewell to our last guest and the door to the castle fell, the Brian and I joined.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">The things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former fellow-dwellers, Nate Blechczyk, joined us as developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">In this way, we presented our Investors: "we want to create a website where people open public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors you take when you visit.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody, who is still at consolation, would invest in a shop that allowed strangers to sleep in homes of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children have all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem you are spinning on the things that you can do. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford it?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample, what degree can we trust.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quietly attacking from panic that you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your text message, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the mobile phones of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just like that, who has actually Al Gores mobile phones?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim it to Twitter that he is member of the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a small detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbour had only once presented with his name; if he had told where he comes, how his dog or his children are hot?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 evaluations, all that say: "he really can hold very well immobilised mobiles!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-covered feedback system reinforces trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to prevent negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had submitted their evaluations before we presented them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probable it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are with regard to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most, who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social biases.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting becomes it if you add the reputation of a person -- in our case through evaluations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three evaluations, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything is changing.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">Moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on how much one can expect from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If one tells too little, as for example "hi!," you get no answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">Tell us a lot, as for example: "I have problems with my mother -- - the request is not accepted rather.</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal level of openness, such as" "" "Tolle works" "" "in your apartment! I make holidays with my family holiday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create design to make this level of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds up the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">With what we had not reckoned, the large amount of people who were more than willing to prevent these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have been unallowed parties or have desolated dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have a stay in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than this calls. it hurts when I just think.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, from the 123 million were only a fraction of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other to law.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust does work, it can create wonder.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even pointed blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travellers looking for sitting activities on heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian saint, who can save life, even though they do not know a real time.</seg>
<seg id="218">You will go to the hospital in your own car when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without having to calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course does not run every stay.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transcription are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share of Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">"" "" "" "it is here about an economic trade." ""</seg>
<seg id="227">However, it is just now just "hiring industry" but the thing doesn't do justice to it.</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves openly and this changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel nowadays, this is fast food to compare. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if tours would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group there would be Ansässleger to show you a thoroughly fill and one in a Kneipentour district which one has never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or when you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">These days apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from scratch to share one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of sharing a common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul this project has already begun. many parking spaces which the government had belonged,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were pulled out. there have been incubator programs,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, night 785 million people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreigner or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was attached to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar sites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from happiness and timing, we realize that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this intriguing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Quite overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I must contemplate on it every time a red Mazda is over by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think about when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">One believers? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, an brainwashing, a terrorist threat?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the reporting of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslims: it is great to meet you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteker-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, Baby, I was not born this way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I met my decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as homosexual human, as some of my friends, but as Muslimine. I decided to bear the Hijab, my headgear.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified," "" "Why do you suppressed yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The same thing was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and with the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and inaccessible beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only adopted the faith of my parents.</seg>

<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I was sitting in my kitchen, had too late, looked at the screen and saw the word "emilations."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes in buildings, people spurs out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into indignation quickly.</seg>

<seg id="300">Oh, my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">It's not only my country attacked but in the Nu changed me the deeds of others from a civil war in one suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start studying.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how we drove me -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as Muslimine.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said, "be vigilant," "Seid warms", "lead in well lit areas," "cuing you not."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims meet for prayer.</seg>

<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">Feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who held free to Muslims and struck.</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who had attacked this land have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have been offended the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain themselves.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is said Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and join mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor to be removed as a whole and a benign tumour only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-aid and Olympias.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will make the closing of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be some parking spaces free but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to contemplate people of other faith and to show greater citizen participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a head of the police in the Washington region, DC recently told: people are actually not forcible in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the radicalization process, one has found that it is starting online. as a result, the person is cut off by her family, so that the extremimistress can make the extremes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who despises her behaviour and ideology is a traitor, or by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we need to keep people going to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to her imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had imagined to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. each clergy with whom she spoke, she brought the silence and told her that her anger, her sense for the injustice in the world, she would only bring into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Of nothing inspired and something that had given sense to her anger, she was a main objective for the instrumentalization of extremists, which they promised a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the link to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing it for her anger, he showed her constructive ways to a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque, she shouted to join the IS before the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight that concerns the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect every other?</seg>
<seg id="357">"" "" "" "how does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?" ""</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people report reviews, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they vote rather military attack on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look at when the mood against Muslims rise above -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of the Iraq war and during two constituencies.</seg>

<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a athlete.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, generous person, whom she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his resume. she was astounded and said,</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my fraternity become such an accomplished young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">When we went to the mosque or we were safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We captivate it and for us it was not an easy decision because it was about what America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear or one in which we can exercise our religion free.</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove exhaust, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, my shoes went out, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me hold.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked his guests, as half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers, and non-believers who have come to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there, because they had courage and compassion.</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for Bastler is nearing a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug. can be made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air package integration into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the Frac Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Surrounded by co-ordinate aircraft, high speed and acceleration in the narrowest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly uploaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">You have learned to bear loads to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of Possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">So that a system works autonomously, it must be collective, where in the room the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. that allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, one of our laboratories.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculations on board, what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands can be found at the highest level, e.g., "and" land. "</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in advance-driving force, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">As opposed to most starters it can float float, and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing, and is highly versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of contagious is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind turbines.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter in whatever location the optimum position can be recovered and improved performance by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstract issues that are prevalent at the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be for example: what is the smallest amount of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known as machines with a thousand motionable parts, which gather together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Several decades ago-trained pilot devices could fly away-controlled aircraft, which had only two mobile parts: a propeller and a taeckar.</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong discovered we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the moon, the mechanically easiest hand-used flight device. it was invented short ago.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbars, no further actuator or checkers, only a propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life very much, so that it can fly stable and move around in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starters. to bring it to flies, I have to throw it exactly correctly.</seg>
<seg id="441">The chance to throw it exactly right when everyone can watch, is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">When the moon is a exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">By doing so he gets the greatest ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even how it rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be traced in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that on.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they need to be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is rotating in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Does not go wrong - a motor or propeller is falling out, the electronics or a battery, the machine can fly further, albeit restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that we make half airworthy airworthy.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration explores synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We participated in southern micro-squares -- each individual weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully, you motivate those demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially secure machine there, I want to be running on Broadway a flying lampshade.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, the wage is in the development and the production of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a memory, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">1,3 billion years ago circled in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are getting faster, they turned so the mass of three sonnen in a tenth of a second in pure energy around.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment it turned brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">However, they do not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into the space-time texture itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago was the most recent life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurs, humans and -- God stood at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss approved by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - to build a huge laser code in order to search for gravitational-waves, which are caused by collidizing black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought it was crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO - the laser-interferometry - gravitational-waves Observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up time the precision of LIGO was significantly increased, which improved the impact performance enormously.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore, we are now calling him Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015 LIGO was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collizing black holes are through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the goodbye from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically, they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist am MIT. he has been investigators for 23 years of vitational-waves from black holes and their by observatory such as LIGO measurable signals. what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crashing in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the passing wave the space and its entire content is stretched in one direction, and into the other strives.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustration, lecturers in courses for relativity-theory often lead a true neutral dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and storage, stretching and stowsing."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched to the waves of the waves and punches. the stretching of an average person was 10-21.</seg>
<seg id="499">This is called 20 nullen after comma, followed by 1. Darum explained the LIGO staff for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometers long laser Detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of a atomic nucleus. that is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity.</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGOs, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are tricky and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott holds gladly, LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for this way, you can make a picture or a map of things by looking at the light around you from multiple points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In pots it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That's why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that will give you a lot of things:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain properties like tape and height, rhythm and volume to close to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now is just Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob interrupts them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob".</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least it is essential for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern in droms, we can hear that all literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravity out of gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, not rotting holes, circulate simple: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circulate with an additional key change. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a type of motion, shaped in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- [Surrendes noise] Jemand, who knows what to hear, recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-fold sunmass, which turn around as fast as the sticks of your blender.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the most dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 others, the other with a mass of 36 others, orbit each one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO has an entirely new way to investigate the universe, as it was never before possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- practically or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserting stars in supernovae explode.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical operations occur however at the core, which is hidden behind thousand kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through, since this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Urquiz: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the Urbang is veiled by its own light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the use of gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before and we have no idea at all. things that we only see by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">Indeed, LIGO found equally in the first attempt things we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of LIGO-Project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars, which produces black holes, like LIGO it, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the sauce for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">LIGO offers us a completely different perspective on the events in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately the way we went out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulate of the cosmos.</seg>

<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I was afraid of what I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous to me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Would I speak in public opinion?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the swing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, but yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just what I was doing before I was afraid, eliminating my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear to hold speeches, my social fear -- buff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes, my life changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yes that changed my life deeply, on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls out of inexplicable reasons all "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimate, I need milk for my beak-up."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go, and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">That Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude in my family. from there I swear to play with them always once you are asking me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I am not perfect, but I felt very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently, I understood that the "yes" sawing to play with my children was saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things emerge, send it to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I creased television. I manufacture television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I am making TV, in big style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for bringing 70 hours to the world in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Every program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV senders can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode all nine days by four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three shows, which are at the same time: 24 episodes: know To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours of television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series run together on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are shipments that I have created myself, and not only produces. I have to find time, really stille, creative time to gather my fans around bonfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, warehouses that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes it?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody, so I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it, because I know what you think if the word "author" fall.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, so that all of you who work so hard whether you are now a company, a country or a classrooms, take a business or a classroom, so you understand that I'm not just sitting on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say, I understand that it is not going to dream about dreams.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, everything work, all reality, all blood, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am deepened in the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It's like I put troops on, as painted me on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as to get a high tone, liefe a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, soundly and rational, cruelly and rational. and the best thing is money.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums it sounds like a busy road, I could always drive to her.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people assume that when I tell them the buzz that I'm writing my writing that writing me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began working with television production when I began working and work and work, to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The money is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The money is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The money is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The money is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, you cannot do otherwise than by size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling, not to be different than looking for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I just know I'm not going to fail for failure, and I just know I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to put it into question.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work more at the same time, the more watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love working, not true?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land, which I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high clay, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the money.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overlap, exaggerated, spread.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mum is a single worker.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">And Emerson says, "estimate, I want to go to Shonda land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of an Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-tians.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums were heard.</seg>
<seg id="649">The amount of the engine died.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The money did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours days, worked out weekends, no remorue, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps, there is not, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "grasshoppers from the author-Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know, you do, you are doing a teacher to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a boy, Bill Gates, you just got a different one and that gives you a buzz when you knew the sums it feels when the sums stopped, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then I put my" "" "southern states" "" "one question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says," "" "Mama, do you play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to all and secondly, she was not calling me "estimate."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls anyone more "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything is changing from my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">And so she says, "mom, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"" "we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatic from the book" "" "Everybody Poops" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the Summering, I can do nothing except to match.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land, which I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, alerts, and the song in which it goes on to let go, or whatever the girl in "The ice rink" let go.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me triggers.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that is not right away, but it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The money is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzz, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzz, the working environment, the titanium-summons that is just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I wonder who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums it is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The money is not strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real money is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The money is the current that comes from lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real money is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real sums are ignoring the pressure of the history, the task of completed tasks, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real money is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real money is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan's?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a solid rule, so I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear it again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not possible to do so, how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working as home at the workplace.</seg>
<seg id="726">This concession is painful, because what a person does rather work than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rode in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shattered soap-bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">Thereby I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I am always afraid of my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">Yet it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzz of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we quit playing with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! say she always Yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you stop me for naïve, for a daydreamy.</seg>
<seg id="742">You will probably be right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you also know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child finds you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me until they digest, that they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Mariansk or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenager every 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, more needs it not need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Every one can catch 15 minutes in a piece, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the kids are praying.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums of money to have a place for his soul peace.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it is about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Allow yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I am not perfect in it. I failed and I victories. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "want to play?" "" "just stand for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training when I wanted to excel myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not have a full 15 minutes indulge?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong anyway? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The money came back in my spare time. the sums it seems to go back when I did not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens up and I find myself in my office again. I listen to an unfamiliar melody, it fills me and my soul. she tempts me to new ideas. I use it in full moves and love my job again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I do not love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the money is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap Pases and sticky finger, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The money of the work is part of me, but just one part. and for this I am so grateful.</seg>
<seg id="778">It is clear to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan, the journey to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land which I created, the marathon, I run, the troops, the canvases, the amount, the sums, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel of this sums, the more this unusual, inspirational, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things from, I get you down to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means to live his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">That is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said yes' to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgical in.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how to change your life from one second to another, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has very small capacity for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a sustained, heavy disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I got functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have heard of one of the most prominent, the "deep-brain stimulation." in this regard, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain to affect the circuits of the neurons so that neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time, I was managing director and working day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I gave patients with skull-Hirn-trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-trauma the brain is swimmers and the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life, you have to decrease the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">To do this, you sometimes have to remove some of the clouds brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To allow cells from a tissue to grow, comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This saw him under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biologieunterricht that stem cells unripe cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small navy of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to maintain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly split up slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new, strange cellular population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed for a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">These are from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make 4% of our grandhirnrinse cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they provide for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them at higher concentrations, near brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brains.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So, we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to see a piece of brain from the non-lingual area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then, simply highlight them, to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we replunged it to the defile of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologised Transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reproduce these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in implied brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we realized the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared, as if they were taken again, they go back home. the space is occupied already, they will not be used there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario, we added an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells and now the cells receive -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof that they show are these little points. these are the cells, which we rowed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we have monkeys with a manual destiny.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had reached a stable level of skill, we injured in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Thereupon the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen with people, they recovering spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastifictional brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side they see the monkeys that recovering spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from infringement.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now let's see when we implanted the cells: the same ape, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later use them.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use them in other neurological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implanted them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that even now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can need it."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on human beings.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. proceeding from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It has been a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate if it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multi-centric study.</seg>
<seg id="897">One has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting us and told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to look at them as granted.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which it is in reality, but as a inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging geance.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitahmer in Beijing have doubted that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not the austerity programmes that have been implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my undue friends who told me that democracy would have abolished, if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup, we believe we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceltic democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Because without democracy our societies are common, our future bleak and our great, new technologies wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">Regarding the waste of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "" "" twin "" "" Paradox. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and know him as the debt mountain, who casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We are all recognizing the debt of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet only few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is, however, is too anxious to invest in there where it would be productive and incomes, with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in the USA, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars worth a lot of money, until you compare it with the $1 trillion in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do, except the stock exchange rates and the property prices are highly accurate.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital make up the twin summit, which are not equal by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low demand fearing the pessimism of investors resulting from fear, the prophecy of the ear, would be true that his son would kill him if he will grow.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unquestioning the circumstances that cause them to kills it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hades with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedling capital All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteldefined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be an error, the significance of the athic democracy due to these outcrop." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive role in the atharian democracy was and is that it gave up the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of speech, but more important and more important to them, giving them the right to political codetermination with the same balancing of equal rights issues.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not long lasted for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which is very bright, it is also fast remarked.</seg>
<seg id="937">"" "" "" "however, our times of liberal democracies are not their roots in ancient Athens," ""</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruler.</seg>
<seg id="940">"" "" "" "for the liberal democracy came only when a full separation between politics and economics is possible and the democratic process has been limited to politics, while the economy - i.e. the world of corporations - a democratic free zone was established." ""</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-day democracies has begun since the time that this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle between the two, and the economy is gradually immigrated to politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are not as much as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not part of a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because you cannot be in the government days, and still does not believe in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and which areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">When you think about it, it is about such a herd of beasts that are so sustainably the animals, of which they are nourished, that they are starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that politics emerged as far as the economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful of capitalism distributes "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the Twin Towers, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the wealth of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to restore politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" control the control, as in the antique Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and wastage.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage sainting with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin-up summit will be higher, the wastage of the wealthy, and the social conflicts are deeper, just as I think -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must reorganise the economy and reunited the areas of economy and politics, and take care of the reunified field otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyperautocracy that can appear as a documentary film "matrix" as a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth to survive --</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "the most interesting question is whether capitalism is" "" "matrix" "" "in the" "" "matrix" "", "or by something that the society in" "" "Star Trek" "", "that people use their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" "" "Agora," "" "in a long talks to the meaning of life." ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would do it like, how could it look like to have this "Star Trek" like Utopia instead of the "Matrix" like Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples soon.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please choose a capital market, where you earn money while you work and in which your funds will follow you from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who're currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and from exhaustion and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work at them, and employees working there, which the company does not belong. no exchange between capital and labour, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no more productive twin-ins.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please pose just before that our national currencies would have a free hesitant exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest prevalence], in the interest of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call them "the cosmos," in units of "Cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial excess of the respective country, into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "also imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investments are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today, we, particularly in front of the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world that I describe you is at the same time liberate, in which it favored privileged people, and Marxist, because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesias, global kegonal.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or do we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work together in common.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I just said, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do not do it, technological development will produce such a massive decline in economic demand, what Larry Summers were referred to as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">Through the transmission of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberalistic democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like keynes, and therefore I am also totally raging.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are at ease.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not inhospitable, you think not enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you told very clearly what you hold from the point of view of the West in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "in our liberal democracies, we have the form of democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of it plays, -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I can say that provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember - we tend to reconnect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can be observed in China now, resembles very the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now throw out what the West has done in the 19th century to act violently to hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listener are curious about your experiences as the Greek finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I reiterated that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half of six months?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal standpoint, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start with the eurozone a new beginning,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the euro zone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">Namely to adopt us from self-sufficiency, and the lasting denial is that massive degradation line has passed through the euro area and continues to reach a massive threat to the development of the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">It is true. unfortunately, the powers within the euro area, within the European group, continue to be elected.</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try a business system which is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, one perhaps can delay it a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Finance Minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance, or any minister who claims after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, he made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Naturally, I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the donors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not there.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to the USSR, only because they did not want to deal with the objections created by the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to confess that they had been catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Worse than during the Great Depression. "</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the Troika's creditors, imposed by this policy, has stressed:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive troduction of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>

<seg id="1038">By Roy Price most of them have never heard, although it is likely to be responsible for 22-minating minutes of your life on 19 April 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leader at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as "movies, TV, technique, tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV-series that Roy did not choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows, which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV-series on the IMDb website. the rating runs from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows can get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows, like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows, addictive, where, after having looked at a season, your brain asks, "Where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left side, here on this end, shows are like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- which should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not care about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to "" "" Toddlers and Tiaras "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1056">It makes more thoughts about the middle outpouring, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not delight.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available and of course it is the first time Amazon makes such a thing, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he is holding a contest.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects through an analysis of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can look at all free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon releases some stuff, then it is up to, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However they don't know they will be observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when to start the show when you pause, which parts you start or look at once again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process these and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a Sitcom on four republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Do anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many of them can remember this show because they were not so good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House is estimated at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">At the same time at another company, another manager took place a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always searching for finding this a super show and he also uses data for it but it makes it different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews that they give the shows, their time, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom on four senators but a drama series on a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Know the show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has ended up a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"" "" "" "house of Cards" "" "receives a 9.1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted to go." ""</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data reverted companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that that should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If one collects millions of data to make a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, or?</seg>
<seg id="1089">When data analysis does not work so this is something startling because we live in a time in which we will gain more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you will be in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal takes place or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be real bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence for this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data sanctified companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">2009 gave Google known that by data analysis outbreaks of flu, the bad way can predict -- by data analysis of the Google research.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news-sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawless, year round year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data can be accomplished, such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life -- in the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we'd prefer to make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">Also I know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I realised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">As a first, you place this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items above; as a wide range, you put the items again together to grasp a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help shit a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suited to re-compose the parts once more and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">This is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put together parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to then get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and mind where they are also in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, why they would otherwise not have been able to understand, but the decision on how to take all of these parts, once again put up a show like "House of Cards" that was not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their choices, first as they are weathered by TV ideas, then as they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "that tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, it was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it is amazing. for decisions using a Jaar or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technology demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in retrospect on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more cloned, like data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the base structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So perhaps the ball will be wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions, if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that in spite of the large amount of data still pays out to make decisions, an expert in what you do and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because at the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
