Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards which change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people are to meet today .
a greeting @-@ chapel , where now for the S @-@ Bahn grid .
small @-@ den@@ ser cultiv@@ ating the in@@ vigor@@ ous reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up to date .
that knows everyone who had to get rid of themselves , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a byp@@ assing way showed a green meadow .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of the State Government , are far from current - yet very conclu@@ sive .
especially when you compare it with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mercury in the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that one cannot recognise as such .
in the big coverage map are more detailed map for cities and communities , so @-@ called urine sheets , which works .
these were developed according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 , and jump from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army forces occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ thic war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course to military purposes .
even though the French troops eventually moved up with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a region @-@ covered Bayern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph led the project to advance the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Audit Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Journal of Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is available as any other website from the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of E@@ arly / Today is most impressive at the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is under@@ d@@ ling that appears in the card of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated .
Send@@ ling was conven@@ ed 21 years after the map , so 1877 , as a Munich &apos;s district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ é focus on 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbers with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered copies of the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ge &quot; from which the property tax was derived .
small plots remain there today no farmers more - but a gar@@ dener of the complex &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 show@@ room of the October Revolution , was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the Ur@@ posi@@ tional Journal , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the road name &quot; at the guest &quot; or from the height &quot; On the air , &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , there are once people with madness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner circle of Ireland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden employed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is connected to King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive in his time and ended for example the accus@@ ation of so called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients had been first square , later it was extended to 500 places .
sometime these capacity no longer ran@@ ged - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East is located there since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s biggest Psych@@ i@@ atri@@ ums in Germany .
on the area of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt can now be meeting young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and changed it into a youth @-@ house with training .
west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses dating back to the 1980s .
in 2015 , the Children &apos;s House &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; - in architectural coun@@ sel on the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , had been destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks .
the Marien@@ bad was listed at 18@@ 56 als &apos; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ finger was named &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies were torn in December 1944 , many holes in the city center .
a big stayed until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages had once been at the Marien@@ hof , where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 by the sp@@ ade for the second S @-@ Bahn .
with the sli@@ der aer@@ ators , the old Munich card can be compared with the air image of today - and re@@ plen@@ ish the hole at the Marien@@ hof .
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ souri
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national union to promote colored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; colored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ souri , on the basis of discrimin@@ atory politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the state of Mis@@ souri are to take special attention until 28 . August 2017 , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ ans to leave particular attention through the state , since a series of frag@@ ment@@ ors @-@ based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and can be noted down here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group .
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ souri , which makes it harder to win discrimination , as well as the prosecution bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to release the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they will hold off because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of Mis@@ souri NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
the group reported incidents like rac@@ ist ver@@ tices against black students at the University of Mis@@ souri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after having no gasoline anymore and taken away by the police for Mis@@ souri , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also pointed to a recent published report by the Office of the Secretary @-@ General of Mis@@ souri , in which black drivers in the state will be 75 per cent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ souri , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; people must be prepared if they bring che@@ ating money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
Mis@@ souri awarded 100 H@@ ass@@ crimes in 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the H@@ ass@@ ary @-@ reporting program of F@@ BI , which proposes the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ souri Law , which would make it harder to shor@@ ten a company due to housing or employment discrimination .
prior to the American Civil War Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) Dest@@ inations for Texas and Arizona , following the states of immigration laws passed , local criminal enforcement authorities had to commit to res@@ tra@@ int people because of immigration violations .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times the measure have been implemented as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
extinction project is elementary
the fisher@@ man @-@ past@@ ure fence @-@ project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Bundestag , Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have found a picture on the spot .
at the Vic@@ tim@@ el@@ hof of the family Sch@@ wen@@ demann met representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U &apos;s association with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
Markus Sch@@ wen@@ demann gave us insights into his farm , in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and housed in five apartments Ferien@@ ga@@ este .
the &quot; Black @-@ ald@@ milk &quot; is for him the alternate filling away for the milk of its cows , so pi@@ wen@@ demann .
at the table of the Ferien@@ ga@@ este it comes exclusively region@@ ales .
as he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the gra@@ vi@@ ar project as &quot; elementary . &quot;
I can not gain le@@ verage on such steep surfaces .
the green spaces for a lot of work , much should be edited with the motor@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the terms and conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and managed to run this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ isers , even if it does not lead to bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognised the significance of the settlement project and is happy to promote leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , the farmers should be supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope so that the for@@ estation of the areas could be drawn up still quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
in 2013 the total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the conservation area amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of its leader was promoted , a quarter carried the village of Fisch@@ bach .
thus , the farmers love 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of past@@ ure .
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ demann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac emphas@@ ised : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter We@@ iss stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are the best food produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the agricultural @-@ law firm ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state promotion of past@@ ure @-@ go@@ ons .
the goal is the revelation of the Black Forest .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR has been established .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the fence may not be sli@@ pper@@ y . ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by for@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the fisher@@ man &apos;s Christmas project , 2018 currently runs the motion of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of Zau@@ n .
the conservation area is 35 hectares , the cal@@ ulated cost lie at more than 112 000 Euro .
is nothing more sacred ?
now , the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty .
the safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to att@@ acking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic t@@ xt in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller does not attack the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ters would have sh@@ out him if he had done it .
but he attacked their significance , and in particular importance that it was attributed to it , when the famous poem of Emma Laz@@ arus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , has been added to its basis .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta sho@@ ots : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world .
the poem which you relate to that was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he himself formulated it , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Laz@@ arus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your exhausted , your poor , / your aff@@ liction the masses , who cra@@ ving for , free to breathe , / the miserable of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ ende waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller got dedicated not to literary critic - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ ump@@ tion USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and their friends who set themselves up to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that she has accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , showing them in an ab@@ used classical imaging representation the feminine embodi@@ ment of freedom .
Laz@@ arus changed this significance : in their poem , the feminine figure is no more abstract , she has received a voice .
and they themselves have a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
and just like Laz@@ arus , the importance of the statue changed , people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing .
the great cry as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Bap@@ tist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one @-@ charge but rather an early Ne@@ oc@@ on who bring the American flame to the converted world : &quot; Lady Liberty is proceeding .
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not intended to enligh@@ ten the path to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the significance of the statue is entirely and a question of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Laz@@ arus was to see it as it was from the exhausted , miserable , but hope@@ ful people have been seen after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives .
their statue said to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective , which Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to recognise .
her tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power .
world Championships 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two steps were part of the United Kingdom &apos;s team .
the Director @-@ direc@@ tor of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member cont@@ ingent of the World Championship &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland developed something special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it , until we figure it out , &quot; said Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the stre@@ et@@ corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to the team of team .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ ie got quite natural , were great . &quot;
the Commonwealth of silver Medal , who will compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 jack@@ ets are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which was reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mu@@ ir @-@ runners Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
it will take part in the 1,500 square and the 5,000 sqm .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was looking for a great season that included the victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary games .
he was reminded of her first world Championships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
the Mann@@ it@@ ts capit@@ al@@ in says that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and with the fin@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special to be in the team that was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour to know , but to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and have chosen to make it very special for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the car@@ rots who belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on Po@@ dien .
what my speech as a captain in matters ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .
so it &apos;s really important to put on these home@@ support and benefit from having we are back at the Olympiastadion .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
block critics concerning Facebook : del@@ ve not a public office if you cannot wear the inser@@ ts of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans also loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers put him because of everything , from internal policy to its political principles .
he pi@@ ped at the cri@@ tiques , safe .
but he did not sil@@ enced its critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid we are led like the sheep to the slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Maryland , governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil War did not def@@ endant it from the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the heads of the govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important if there is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhel@@ m@@ ingly democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the highest @-@ ranking approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary he@@ ater .
he has a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very fond of using Facebook as the primary means to join with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the govern@@ ors of the govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially referred to as officially and by employees that are paid with public tax dollars , need@@ less and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ person defended the actions of the govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of sun@@ glasses or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ asser@@ s people who are online the whi@@ p vibr@@ ate .
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entreprene@@ ur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls .
they all said that their comments are respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ited .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ ddy Catholic faith .
Law@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , MD . , was not filled , but she asked about gra@@ zing .
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other latest news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the message &quot; The post . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are rather classified as a so @-@ called collective engagement and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors of the govern@@ ors were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated Spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ language &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to watch a message by simply blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical models and to burn or to burn prot@@ esters and to silence them .
but that is exactly what is happening now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze it that he described Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Supervis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County received the first A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the U.S. District of James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she ex@@ iles a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters on his leadership .
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ lls .
the people who use pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , Trade and cruise with Great Britain , over@@ power its position , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project .
but he did not sil@@ enced them .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is celebrated in the next three days on home comfort , as the Renaissance club in East Lo@@ th@@ ian organized the 25 edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , which took place last year next door in Ar@@ cher@@ field links up to the final class , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected with the new eye site and acts as a tournament @-@ ambassador in the name of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raphael .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous suppor@@ ter of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , even though he won his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; this really feels especially true , &quot; he said in South@@ port set players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was in the year after I won it , taken out of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year to European Senior Tour , returns to the campaign to return home .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more , if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ps .
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad how far it worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the trio in the field the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ faculty .
Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six car@@ rots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond .
the entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with a in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates .
all proceeds to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer through pas@@ si@@ vity
over the past two decades fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
the researchers at the University Clinic Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come to a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer is attribut@@ able to pas@@ si@@ v@@ smoke &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Studien@@ ladder Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison he moved with an own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to pas@@ si@@ v@@ pir@@ ated per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
primary accounts prove to be very complex
the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and will be somewhat isolated in time , &quot; says the head of the court Fred Hein@@ ze .
in the area of the house closures , the location was more complicated than suspected , as in the underground is much ver@@ ted , which is not noted in the plans .
the traffic , which hin@@ ders the construction work again , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ out is already enormous , &quot; reports Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the regular @-@ buses are justified for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z has been employed by the St@@ ump@@ p company for weeks with the work on the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting already . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were looked after by our friend Fritz Matt with refreshing mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gol@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she uses no stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the Un@@ calm Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the hung@@ red wool was taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , in@@ washed hands , and swal@@ lowed up .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the pine@@ apple - she has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby bo@@ g .
a bu@@ cket in a homeless space serves as a Lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to fields .
poly@@ gam@@ y is custom@@ ary here .
of course , late at work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are here the soldiers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody sha@@ kes so , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 El@@ der would vote before the occupying forces before the occupying forces .
an existing movement that stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch reign , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , who owns control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or jurisdictions .
in 2003 the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , where independent part of Papua New Guinea has occupied the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo @-@ trees , and of wave @-@ roofs , which were converted by R@@ ost in various yellow @-@ brown sounds .
very few Indones@@ ians have made their trip here , failed because journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans had a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and pointed to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , you dark shirt and her bright rock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indones@@ ian province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s most important children and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also Indones@@ ian gol@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , grass berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a stronghold in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 , Free@@ port was built in the value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollars and copper .
in addition , Papua with wood resources has a value of estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are however a source of misery for the Papua which ensure that Indones@@ ian armed forces retains a sti@@ cking presence .
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 paid almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden G@@ ans and are mer@@ c@@ il@@ essly treated .
according to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed and incar@@ cer@@ ated since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military .
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal u@@ pland in 1970 @-@ 1980 years have been subject to genocide , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police de@@ tained more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All Ver@@ sions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Brisbane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports about atrocities and torture - rape and electro@@ pl@@ ings are particularly popular according to a different report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s difficult to count the number of victims as each week will happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bol@@ ts have reinforced themselves as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83 % Christian , but demographic developments changed because Muslim economic migrants are from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ning V@@ ine sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ uts .
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; the migrants started to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to work in the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , in the popular and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 to tackle inequalities and infrin@@ gements in Papua .
the former Zimmermann @-@ secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua a little has changed , and today the locals feel che@@ ated .
&quot; our hearts have broken , because we voted 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You .
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai actually suffered a low point in October after Jok@@ ow@@ is initiation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorbike by the darkness bra@@ ins .
the sm@@ elled children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took an impetus to her tone and came later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who drunk , mour@@ ned , and stroke the group with their rif@@ le , they said victims and witnesses .
then , one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Yu@@ li@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government Commission was put into fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered themselves on a football field in front of the local police station and the Military commander in order to demand justice .
they practiced cerem@@ onial hunting and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in the circle continually and a bird @-@ singing im@@ it@@ ous - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ Stamm .
some demonstrators started to s@@ wap stones at police and military post .
when the atmosphere was heated up , the soldiers were sent via an internal radio : &quot; if the masses could afford more than three resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of T@@ IME that has not been released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ min@@ ent danger and called for peace and demanded the crowd to return home .
nobody was listening in the mood .
&quot; when I turned down , I suddenly shot my wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colorful be@@ trot@@ ter wooden house .
Kay@@ ame does not still know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the sho@@ ots .
&quot; I ran into him and studied his body to make sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indones@@ ians only carry one name , the T@@ IME in gri@@ mmer mood .
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters , that his officers wanted to only secure their station &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they are attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others are wounded .
the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate talk in which he voiced sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ am to address the historical griev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved right away , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safety Minister W@@ ic@@ anto said in October 2016 that he used an extra@@ judicial mechanism for breaking historical violations of human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the pron@@ unciation began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; he said .
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he spoke to T@@ IME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said , he did not have any plans to set up into Papua mechanism .
instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , whom the UN had indicted for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been fixed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Vor@@ incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were opposed to such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ mm@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , have fear to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was defeated by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military looked after me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between the inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital , died a person and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned , when he f@@ ished in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital .
high @-@ villagers were prot@@ esting before the company &apos;s site office .
the police said that the villagers were dump@@ ed stones on officers who re@@ acted out by fire them by warning .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and a k@@ ills .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the injured here was quickly delivered , so the T@@ IME .
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ gade of the police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a ru@@ gated board for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of sensual development strengthens the satisfaction of the tribal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , who claims to defend the rights of Papua by encounter@@ ing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in prison in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pretext of safeguarding the national sovereignty . &quot;
some never dive again .
among the people of Papua ( Pan@@ i@@ ai as a &quot; deadly , forgotten place &quot; ) .
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
the bit of rice , who is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women working in four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a ko@@ ves only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ien ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
over time , economic inequalities between the local Papua and the new immigrants have grown since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in larger number .
the few jobs that exist in the region are usually due to the better educated and wealthy migrants .
they rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to competitive their own enterprises .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John G@@ ob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense .
at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ le and Basi@@ cs Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission were given to the film .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the re@@ assur@@ ances of Jok@@ ow@@ is Elec@@ tions , the limitations of reporting , to promote transparency and development , are not realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indones@@ ian un@@ calm provinces of Papua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the direct neighbours Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March called six Pacific countries - Tong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; different and widespread injury &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r pointed the re@@ pro@@ aches of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and aff@@ liction him , &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also participated in the meeting , but remain anonymous .
Indonesia will be another presidential election , but the Papua say that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says G@@ ob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military lives , is in impover@@ ished gu@@ ardi@@ ans and health services .
G@@ ob@@ ai says that the pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , have to look at their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must rep@@ ay .
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and intimi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ offerings led to the last symbolic act of the Des@@ p@@ ite : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried on a site opposite the police and the military station .
they know they may never give justice to them , but at least they have not forgotten their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a precious head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai its break@@ through@@ s and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is easily called the Tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stood at the fire alarm and scre@@ ams of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; said a resident , who gave his name as George , Re@@ uters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building desc@@ ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said it was working on providing accommodations for those concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in foreign areas of skyscrapers around the world .
a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its brand in 2015 yiel@@ ded that the largest part of the damages from the dis@@ guise , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came .
in Britain the police , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and clothing to the London Gren@@ fell @-@ Tower in June has contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ ch in June , in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Bureau of tennis ( IT@@ F ) has fallen by its great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting was supported by this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single @-@ single , only on two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority .
the fact that often very long , but also so much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the tradition of a tradition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member countries vote for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scarce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these i@@ kon@@ ic and historical competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the rates .
even after the vote , the proposal came to a neutral place after many contradictions .
new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively small details : so the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right in the first round in the first round .
to reduce costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements in training places , etc. will be facilitated and the players will need to complete less official media outlets before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers brings bot@@ tom@@ ed items to the plane , finding a survey
a survey conducted among aviation , yiel@@ ded that more than 20 per cent consciously or un@@ consciously prescribed articles on the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration is crossed over , including at least 6 percent that entered the plane while they acci@@ dentally used kni@@ fes or other objects with blades .
less than 1 per cent were claimed , they would have bel@@ ated that they were mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey on more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also realized that more younger travellers should rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents , the en@@ cor@@ es that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were .
the most common items that were passed to T@@ SA agents were visi@@ bly passed by , were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent declined to have know@@ ingly solic@@ ited items carried on by the safety control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents confirmed that they could have deliberately failed drugs into the plane .
the company said it was asked for travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mug@@ gler brought in through the airport security and how many would have done inten@@ tionally .
it &apos;s no surprise that people who are most likely s@@ mug@@ gler - know@@ ingly or un@@ know@@ ingly - by the safety carry those who were most often flying .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA Gui@@ delines are a little complicated and confusing .
people are often unsure which fluids are allowed to take them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA waste .
for a time , people thought the T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mug@@ gler .
liquids is permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ customers cancel Order
electric @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k offers the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
at the same time , he has so far signed that a part of the customer has withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the continually triumph@@ ant figures of revenue growth and a gigantic market target , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k betrayed a different , less gl@@ amping number : the cancellation Policy in the new mass market model 3 .
Mus@@ k was frequently advertised in the past few months with more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery is just starting .
now Schmit@@ t Mus@@ k : by the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been re@@ trac@@ ted .
critics were always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
when cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
currently , 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are currently available , sp@@ un Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
that cancellation of up to so far twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , however , the Tes@@ la boss doesn &apos;t believe .
its argument : the challenge facing the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year Tes@@ la 8@@ ,000 vehicles delivered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2018 : all models will be taken together - 500,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a million &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , are currently available per day of 1800 reservations .
those who ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can be expected in the second half of 2018 , at the earliest - if Tes@@ la creates it , his brand @-@ new , have never been able to carry out production roads without major interrup@@ tions with maximum utilisation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , then the ob@@ scen@@ ity of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot go away from satisfied customers in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ itt moves forward because of the addition of the rules of the Obama Administration to reduce emissions
one day after which he had w@@ aged from 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce emissions Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollution .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the Shift , as his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities to reaction faster than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit , which had been raised against his previous place in a federal government .
it is a deadline that ran on 1 October for countries to comply with O@@ zon standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will delay the compliance with a year in order to give more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was appointed president of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeated over to blocking or delay regulations , to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels continue to resist .
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal retreat for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal State Court in Washington decided that the EPA has passed its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas company to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt said that his turn@@ around at O@@ zon@@ ate was simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate fully with countries through the complex process of timely meeting of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often observed the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others , and in an agreement struck the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation of jurisdiction and we take time seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also accept the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA approved that P@@ ru@@ gged sometime his &quot; authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full authority &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on solid politics and the best available information is based . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re@@ setting of o@@ zone rules .
a bill for the last month of approved legislation is to delay the implementation of the rules by 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made in the Senate .
the New York General Manager , Eric tail@@ oring , who led the coalition of the States who had compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans affected directly from the smo@@ g , which flows into their communities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said tail@@ oring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ s@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone comes when pollut@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the im@@ pending smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of men , and every year contributes to thousands of premature death accidents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejoice at P@@ ru@@ ining &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chang@@ ing Course change &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is troub@@ ling as much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible person responsible for protecting the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to so@@ ak up against pollut@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ her@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg certificates of Ans@@ wer : Graf Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the sanctuary of the parish church with the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; an Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , on the tum@@ linger mountain apart from the erst@@ while parish church was also a splendid court that belonged to the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age rather than the other way round .
so there were people there .
as is the description of the lie@@ der Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlements of the village .
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was born out of the earliest medieval property law .

thus , the right to advocate a pastor or to propose a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars there were in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two zer@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell appeared then for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be given later during World War II in 1942 .
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the wind@@ ow@@ ls were pushed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .
in 17@@ 96 French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened 18@@ 09 .
until 1869 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was used as the last resting place for the deaths from listening .
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ary Church was disman@@ tled .
only the cherry walk was standing .
in the New Year 18@@ 34 , a storm took a storm storm and the half rus@@ hed .
to avoid harm , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the present tower still available today was to be a witness of the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are employed by the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen &quot; as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .

society wants to check the approval of windsurfing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not looking for legal requirements for the construction and has therefore directed itself to the coun@@ cill@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been asked to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on December 30 , 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , none wind turbines can have been approved , since at that time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal there exists a wind power @-@ concentration zone .
within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration zone but the exclusion of wind use for the rest area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all zones should avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the town four days ago had decided only a few days before , a second wind power station in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the District government was not approved by Düsseldorf , because of a form fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirement , the assigned authorization is still remains un@@ lawful and therefore also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christopher Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current status of the things : the town@@ ship once again decided the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , for the approval of the district government is still off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; er@@ kens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this point , the creation of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines was not excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been sent to the circle since past week , &quot; said a spokes@@ man .
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
but they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the ongoing trial at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself on the line of reasoning by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , an affiliate of the NEW , is planning to build on an area on the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette to build four hundred meters high wind@@ wheels .
already last year , the company , in which the city was founded Qu@@ at@@ ander , particip@@ ations with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of large tanks .
with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power supply is to be covered by around 11 400 households , which is equivalent to one fifth of the power needs of all quadru@@ pe@@ ers households .
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
in the past summer there was a green light to buy three wind turbines during the wind park lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor stro@@ kes together : woman dies with a terrible accident
one dre@@ ad@@ ful traffic accident has taken on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 at the L 3@@ 33 between the Lower @-@ up and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ district ) .
a woman has been fatal .
two more people were slightly wounded .
the Landes@@ straße remained locked over hours .
according to police statements a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch had with their cars in the frame of the accompanying riding with its 53 @-@ year mother as companion people the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ ls and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping area in the city of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents for the shopping stroll into the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the president of the Trial 1 , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; weekend will sensi@@ tise the customers to the public , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket .
according to this , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .
furthermore , the companies are to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city center are to be invited to the &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ night shopping . &quot;
the promotion of action was not only at the residents of the city and the surrounding region .
in preparation are commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , which point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian king .
city management and commercial Association cooperate with the industrial and Chamber of Commerce .
this concludes the industrial branch and the city into a further stage of the project At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Brun@@ nen@@ fest and every Sunday , discussions with all entrepreneurs , to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the res@@ igns at parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened again or again .
these include tourist guests and tourists .
but also many local people would have lost the city center when shopping out of the sea .
in the end , everyone would have to rev@@ itali@@ ze the city center - up to landlords , the activities of the whole city and associations .
it po@@ unded to sur@@ mount a network of le@@ th@@ arg@@ y which have been partly wide , had said King in spring .
Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen shared with them that participate in the nationwide third &quot; home shopping &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Al@@ cher@@ ode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day sol@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Feder@@ ity of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can be influenced by his buying behaviour and influence the environment itself .

Tr@@ ump sat down after a spot@@ ted trans@@ criptions by phone calls Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a phon@@ em@@ ate with the Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to , to stop , publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President condem@@ ns him , because he denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . tell him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the reason that you cannot say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump began his presidential campaign to start the presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and s@@ wor@@ e to pay Mexico for the project .
trans@@ crip@@ tive of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m TR@@ bull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ stones that emigr@@ ated to Australia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ridiculous &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that the c@@ ess@@ ation on the trade that was conve@@ yed by the Obama administration to look like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dep@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after spending a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ stones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ inking to the Ford &apos;s Bridge of Moore .
before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had reached the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block its way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strike - took a long turn to its ci@@ gar and looked forward to the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates were pl@@ assen in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ min@@ ent of the man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ l it from the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ened the silence , as a young black man was torn away from the passenger seat .
fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a post@@ position .
but when then a loop around the throat by &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience got very real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 we return to the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it truly is unmistak@@ able that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organizing the post @-@ position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congresses of the State of Georgia and a life long civil rights .
for him the post@@ position as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that wron@@ g@@ ly been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a cour@@ thouse holds a beg@@ gar on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ chens on July 27 , 1946 .
according to F@@ BI files obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding el@@ ands in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process .
but none has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the open foot for decades , say citizenship , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made the black people in Georgia for the first time to release their voice in the summer .
about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI &apos;s black colo@@ uring , Roger Mal@@ com a white base owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly on account of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby who bore it was not from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from the prison , so F@@ BI .
he was created by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when she went away from the prison and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b embr@@ aced the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared the mor@@ de and arranged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes a F@@ BI Report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , pointing the evidence and mis@@ ses the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a constitu@@ tive massacre , &quot; he said .
&quot; you were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and let you vote then this will happen to you . &quot;
for nearly a decade , C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual post@@ position of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their presentation is vivid , po@@ ignant and founded in a kind of deep racism , of which many believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and even more difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ x because we are then confronted with the u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have through . &quot;
the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of Black - in a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed , as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece started .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ ce@@ ds for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester &apos;s cri@@ es and stro@@ kes , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n -@@ -- he , dev@@ out of my own property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona pays the fire .
there is a break .
and then each ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ ck@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think white people then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; n -@@ -- he said &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you only need to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
and it is just that the energy shifts in the room , a sense of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaced the discomfort .
everyone is busy to get this properly , not just because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins once again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona the N @-@ word says , he says it sharp and with p@@ im@@ prints .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman , lined with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and introduces che@@ e holidays sad@@ dened &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot;
their voice breaks out in every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it there is a group of about four dozen spect@@ ator sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come just down the street .
they have all experienced an almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bst@@ ones of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the Mor@@ de has stayed a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now if one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels f@@ aint .
when the last notes of the song ends , Gre@@ ene invites you to get closer and to insp@@ ect the body .
children ho@@ cken in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering one another .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ ders a little boy , as if he want to remember it .
after a few minutes I would like to thank Gre@@ ene of the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope off and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit who has played the C@@ lan@@ a .
Nick Ras@@ cona nest@@ les two of his fellow @-@ players and then we@@ eping in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sets up with the actors for dinner .
at one table chat@@ ting a white pair of Atlanta , stimulated by the post @-@ position with a black couple that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find words which has left the performance of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you yourself and that which do , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today the only Police shoot is called &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one is holding Broo@@ ks &apos;s yard at his table , he eats and remember the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the post@@ position is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is like we do nothing from it , then it can happen again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he who did not study his own story who does not know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the big heat again in le@@ ased leisure wear .
the performance was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
in 2013 he had still had a strong arrow @-@ concert about himself , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; covered by the single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed it .
&quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said just before the performance of d@@ pa .
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of this point of view .
I prefer a positive reset .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in multiple places in their Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in furniture , once a week I spent here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have worked on the school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late professional volunteer .
how does that come about ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ it@@ ur .
and then a civil engineer , we say , successfully interrupted .
I have known for me that it is the Fal@@ se and I want to do something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
have a social year , there is a look at it , there you can see how it is on site , in focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will study dual statistics , probably make in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social @-@ job training and study in Ham@@ m at Fach@@ hochschule .
is it not uncommon to have several different resorts in voluntary service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends on where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very diversified .
I was partially in the O@@ GS , so in after@@ math support .
for me it was the right thing that has irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different from civil engineering ?
quantity : well , here it is not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one always has another person &apos;s head , which each have a very different story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you must always deal with them individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but so life is just .
Pear@@ son flies further 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will build more 3,000 jobs and cut their inter@@ sections by 72 percent since another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing .
the job@@ building , the General Director , John Fall@@ on , announced mainly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 places were already lost .
Pear@@ son announced a plan to reduce cost reduction by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in order to revi@@ ve a deal with the rapid step of digital learning .
the company , which last month expressed its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House at the Partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after the first half of the year achieved a sales increase of 1 per cent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds .
con@@ voy attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldiers killed in suici@@ dal attack
a suici@@ de has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several other injured , civil servants .
five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded , shared an explanation of Nato .
according to these reports , un@@ confirmed local reports showed that in the incident in the district Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suici@@ de were killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of Nato it is to happen , the explosion on Thursday night was done when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was impro@@ vised by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an army &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state and in the U.S. military hospital on the plane Bag@@ ram will be treated .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suici@@ de @-@ car@@ om@@ be killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attacks of the country , since the US @-@ led troops took over the Taliban from power in 2001 .
the violence underlines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suici@@ dal attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EPA is returning to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule by pl@@ agues around
the US environmental protection authority has a decision to wai@@ ve a regulation of the Obama administration , wai@@ ve what the states are committed to in@@ dem@@ ise the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 countries def@@ endants the agency because of the pac@@ em@@ aker .
the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zon@@ ated &quot; 2015 , &quot; and said , it show the obligation of the agency to work with states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we will respond to our state partners &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA , to specify O@@ zon@@ ated emissions in June , in which parts of the country should be measured in order to specify where inc@@ isions are to be made to delay more stringent balance standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 , mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , held on Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a broad range of environmental impacts which former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which shall boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
however , efforts have triggered the impact of the Democrats and nature groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health .
the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lungs &quot; function and increase the respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma .
common community wants community @-@ space
at the end , the decision was clear : in two votes decides the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ds the establishment of a common space in the future old inn .
in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement was signed for the missing piece of land , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ad .
although there will still be until the churches of the church community are owned by the parish church , but there is now no planning for planning a private investor to a static project more .
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
one of the two investors which are still in the boat are offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a total of 70 square meters area available for a special price .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and majority of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such a common room is not only to be viewed as a meeting place only for residents of sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly in the community . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the turn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the decision adopted by providing resources for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , through funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the refurb@@ ishment region .
the establishment of a common area would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent conve@@ yed .
the decision @-@ advice is to signal the investor to show him no bil@@ lets between the legs , the finding that both Satt@@ el@@ - and what is reduced to the environment @-@ building - as well as a counter @-@ roof - which reduces the tear @-@ up and the construction of economic power - which would be possible .
need@@ less , this is not only Wil@@ fried son@@ mer , be this supplement .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously does he pass the body .
it is not that simple at the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Call points to the many own buildings with whom you are not going to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; they are now looking at the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely to speak for the common room - but absolutely against a local participation .
it will see behind it a co@@ vert sub @-@ invention at any rate of high @-@ bearing or even foreign investors .
this is not so , because with the purchase of the area do not give any allowance , but get a real , in doubt , in the case of a doubt , is the counter@@ line .
state of the request to raise the decision @-@ up , will find three supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , it remains in two counter@@ votes at the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller concludes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we hold the decision so we make a giant step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern walking to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the har@@ z the federal first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be developed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte San@@ kt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planet @-@ track is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come forward to the needs of many hard@@ ships , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it uni@@ fies nature , science , exercise and athle@@ tic performance .
members want to set up along the schedule route and inform them about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the first phase up to 2018 , the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ achie@@ vable installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
infrastructures in St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ he@@ dic@@ ation and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supple@@ mented by the Internet .
therefore , in the sit@@ ing of thousands , a good mobile net @-@ reception plays a role .
barrier @-@ free is a crit@@ erion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train should be expanded by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path the viewer will learn a great deal of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , even though he is much further away .
I am also taught in which constellation can be a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 the association has been operating in the Urban Urban centre St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest located observatory in Northern Germany .
the location in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda @-@ galaxy were clearly visible with the naked eye .
in the UNI @-@ City , since 2003 there has been an initiative of the funding of Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen somewhat similar to the planned star@@ wer@@ age - the planetary track .
starting before Geb@@ h@@ ards Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet leads along with its ste@@ els up to Hain@@ berg and observatory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the con@@ w@@ ns with the individual planets - including des to the Zwerg@@ Plan@@ ets degra@@ ded Plu@@ to , at the end @-@ point - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sco@@ op of 6.5 milli@@ metres , while the sun is about 70 centimeters away .
the whole distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light is needed from sun to the planet Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedest@@ rians a good hour up to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedest@@ rians are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would still last a half year .

they were in separate rooms at E@@ SP@@ N offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ initiated World Bo@@ xing Council , lightweight , the corridor downhill to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing organization super @-@ spring Champion .
after Gar@@ cias &apos;s victory due to an agre@@ eable decision on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
Gar@@ cia stretched forth the right hand and said , &quot; How is it about thee ?
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on E@@ SP@@ N .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the pair of photos taken , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect size &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m rising for bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to be down on light weight .
and he has to move on light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko has agreed .
&quot; bo@@ xing needs this fight . &quot;
climate asks whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound its debut in this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winners of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell in the forum on September 23 .
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all fans after him have asked , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and fell later openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .
we are the best .
no other name can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he said Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous comb@@ at@@ ant &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday fighting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ fight champion of River@@ side looked very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ Aus . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said , the focus was to show head@@ set , then boxes .
both said , they could feel the momentum that built up for your own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that has to be performed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and this is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire @-@ space
in an accident on the A7 motorway , four people were injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira had lost its control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 clock shortly before the connection point .
the car tow@@ ed to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it was over and then lie down on the roof of the green strip .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured due to the rescue service , the A7 towards north for about an hour was blocked , then the traffic could be subject to the accident strip at the left edge of the accident .
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points .
with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , if not the two oppos@@ ites were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ore to much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .
the triple chain should also be further optimised in the Or@@ e Mountains .
and a gate after a l@@ isto@@ ß would no longer want to catch out on the lag@@ o@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no longer runs alongside Michael ( R@@ ensing ) to the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experiences in preparation with the triple chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ man Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is one of his cause , &quot; because we just have in the triple chain on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann player who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is , however , that we are still better and we do not afford to play as many play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; if one cannot speak after a draw from a mis@@ o@@ iled start , do not know .
the performance might be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start of the season , I assessed only after six to eight players &apos; days , &quot; said Fried@@ man Fun@@ kel , who does not want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ g , only because the game of Saxony had to be broken down pre@@ mat@@ urely due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be somewhat fres@@ her , as they might have no heavier and complete game like Fortuna against a ascent fav@@ ors in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inner defen@@ ders of Fortuna .
although the guests from the Rhein@@ land act as a lighter Favor@@ it on Sunday in the meeting in the last ( almost ) completed stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep away only because we are entitled to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fun@@ kel , whose record is at only a defeat against Au@@ g from nine games quite positive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to strike from the outset , &quot; says Fort@@ unas Chef .
&quot; such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and over@@ seeing . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel does not want to experience his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of the Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests
the recent findings of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the people tested older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzle medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun with the implementation of the tests last year .
they are to take the assessment of the age during the asylum process after the Swedish migration authority ( migr@@ atory ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were lesser @-@ round .
until today , migr@@ atory bit@@ et 6,@@ 8@@ 80 has been sent to tests and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion that the person may &quot; possibly be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests will only be carried out in cases where the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of last months , the numbers are quite consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers over his age has been lied .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the 5@@ 81 findings presented , it fixed that in the 243 cases the person had openly told that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age rating , which is made in x @-@ ray @-@ rays of wisdom and MR@@ I scans of squ@@ ats , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas .
a Sk@@ ep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ olin@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later as usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the way the measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro .
Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended however the accuracy of the tests : &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is un@@ true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is that the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it works great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ er , Bau@@ leader at the department road and traffic in the government of the government of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work started at the same time at all three gentle bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the installation is planned for October and is safe to keep the schedule .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is lined with red bun@@ k@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4,@@ 80 meters .
it was built in the year 1900 .
like the other two bridges , she has now come into the years .
to ensure the stability of the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the other two bridges lead through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were established in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now facing on Wednesday morning a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called Brü@@ cken@@ cap .
that is a margin@@ al correction , which is also used as a farm .
on the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meters wide bridge can be inserted on Friday .
then the wal@@ lets go away .
the particular thing is that these parts are fabri@@ cation , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already fitted with the patented bridge @-@ caps .
particular finger@@ tips that requires the wir@@ ing of lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ fibre cable connected to which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ writing about the project .
in addition , fish and cr@@ abs had to be f@@ ished at first .
for the bridges between the building and the collective , in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic lights .
for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bacher &apos;s entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof , &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is fully locked .
the cost of the three breasts are combined with 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ ch in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest with German potato salad
yes , it is not so frequent that parties go on a pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ ales ) , together , what else is difficult to bring under a hat .
the parties &quot; parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ W@@ G , left ) belong to a broad coalition that demonstrates this day peacefully , because the Af@@ ales in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ invites to the poster &quot; great electoral campaign . &quot;
and known names at the start brings - as Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land formed the top not@@ ator for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already hours before the start of the event are not wanting to listen to the Af@@ for@@ ties , but demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
originally , the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but takes place now on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ ales event in the Stadthalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forums One World and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; original potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ ales problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with me .
the police demanded many officials from Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues .
how is the Af@@ ine actually came to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ ales volcanic Ei@@ fel zoo , he tries to take care of such an event and get the surcharge .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there were a cancellation , because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes does not have enough parking spaces available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 20 am on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse Red@@ ner , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ic Af@@ y @-@ president Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 audiences who are waiting to keep the top did@@ geri@@ atric for the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening .
something more than an hour takes the Af@@ ales event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is said just after 21 hours .
the police can dis@@ locate - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re @-@ hearing with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ Concert tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the Kloster@@ kirche .
together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ can@@ ic &quot; meets on a classic German education with roots in brass music .
both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have set Sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European top orches@@ tras .
in this way Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ trumpet is the SW@@ R Symphony orchestra .
both combines the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments but also merge the boundaries of the different gen@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so Johann Sebastian Bach at the two like in a new guise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Y@@ at@@ ze@@ ch@@ op@@ re@@ istr@@ ates N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classical , jazz and free play to a fascinating overall artwork . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this nuclear piece of the program has only been premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its particular acou@@ sti@@ cs is deliberately included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Stewart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Kr@@ isten Stewart completely open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I stick to gri@@ lled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ wood stars was the one in her &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who ultimately went up bitter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite everything ass@@ ures the brothers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone I am writing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kr@@ isten ceased to say that she has bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I just liked it to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially among them suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the school time when they prefer to be like a bu@@ b : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this really injured me very badly .
when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b .
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and feel angry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me to be un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he switches the party
the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party .
whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice .
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as a inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration for re@@ public@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a coach I would say it &apos;s time to play a different game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised previously a grand announcement of the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not pay the democratic candidate Hill@@ ary Clinton .
Justice , according to For@@ bes the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes manifes@@ ts that he possesses coal mining in five countries , and inherited a coal @-@ shop from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee gave a statement on Thursday night in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would work us rather than to work out to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top down to down without leadership , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for D@@ oping sc@@ andal
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised that he described as an un@@ question@@ able excuse from Russia to a D@@ oping sc@@ andal , but he reiter@@ ated that it is not the moment for the country to be res@@ umed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin taught at the eve of athle@@ tics world championship champi@@ onships that the exile of his country was correct from sport and determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have picked up gold and silver medals for &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the prohibition , which was imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) has found evidence of state dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the repor@@ ters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that she has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Ms Co@@ e , he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted that Russia has accepted the criteria for his re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dep@@ ra@@ ved system , &quot; he added
nin@@ ety Russian athletes at the athle@@ tics world championship which commence Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the Director of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Andersen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting .
dro@@ p@@ ests are still inadequate and forbidden trainer are still working freely , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a presentation at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral service for in Mali devast@@ ated soldiers
at a funeral service in Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two are thought of a helicopter @-@ crash in Mali up@@ swing soldiers .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
to an un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they called the two up@@ swing drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ ön@@ ner of their expert &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were ple@@ xed to this highest sacrifice which they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a Tot@@ en@@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom San@@ kt Peter .
at mid@@ day , only the relatives were in the church par@@ ting .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general secretary of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
grapes laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the branches .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defense ministers of the Le@@ yen awarded the revers@@ ed soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ an soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann received the flight operation of the battle @-@ helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with and was one of the first six educated Tiger pilot of his regim@@ ent .
also Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; if these crew could not turn the crash , then it would not have mo@@ cked . &quot;
Zweifel at the UN Mission in Mali did not show the Minister from Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is of high significance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the s@@ mu@@ gs were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are best@@ owed , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife .
the house divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish Ga@@ ar is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard fer@@ v@@ nia a coff@@ in for the two .
the Queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it says furthermore in the message .
where prince Hen@@ rik was buried , be still unclear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have loved to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he went into the retirement and also sets the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prin@@ tings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted , he sees himself not as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene b@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker at the Danish king &apos;s house .
where the last resting @-@ term of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be unclear .
but he did not intend to teach in his French country but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
at the Thames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always coinci@@ ded , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his barely 50 years of rain .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ings instead of stro@@ kes , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the call here had the reputation to be the brand social @-@ critical intelligent@@ sia , I could not hope for tut@@ oring .
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
pre @-@ causing Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green governmental majority for a quick re @-@ election of the country , but he doesn &apos;t want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke on Friday for the Parliament resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the un@@ iting res@@ ignation of a Green Parliament from their country @-@ group members in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its cap @-@ majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Group El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets founded their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it on Friday in Hannover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to record them .
with this would have CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Parliament , SD@@ P and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship was the other way round .
the new landing day will be re @-@ elected on the 14th of January .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green State government must now decide whether or not they can be ruling in this situation without a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l is necessary however , indispensable for the day that the day is as quickly as its self @-@ dissolution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state of State considers the possibility that the Minister @-@ Parliament gives the trust to the Prime Minister and chooses his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally checked and &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are not adequately checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something short &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat cur@@ i@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politician himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she drew itself as a ad@@ ress of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the ab@@ ir@@ onic parliament@@ arians to return their country to land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we think of course , that they have received their country house , which has received them via the green country list , shared with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared the Landes@@ presidents Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have decided not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend that step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ head of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of the former Green Democr@@ at MEPs in Nieder@@ sachsen is not only a betra@@ yal of the voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but also betra@@ yal of red green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the president of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) to re@@ define the country &apos;s day .
the exit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its injured van@@ ity and in her frustration , her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critical SPD @-@ Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that strikes the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony in this dirty game and is trying to beat out political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chairman of the CD@@ U leader Björ@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wanted to recommend his dep@@ u@@ ties , El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ jack@@ ets , with personal career thinking the result of the Pre @-@ election 2013 to fal@@ si@@ fy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U was then the strongest force in front of the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD and Green in the Parliament had a very thin majority from one voice in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
agricultural Minister in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editors of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect themselves from toxic eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumers to look exactly and check the eggs in your fridge and check the st@@ amping pressure .
the federal states provide the latest information on the passenger char@@ ms for the consumer protection portal at www.@@ gro@@ war@@ e.@@ .de .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ard is virtually eliminated .
now Al@@ di has the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
nevertheless , my house has immediately turned up immediately , and since then the du@@ ff@@ ness of Germany has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade has the same way as the manufacturers to ensure that the selling products are busi@@ est and health @-@ uniform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if in eggs of the claim level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not traffic @-@ capable .
un@@ loaded eggs are however sold and consumed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time are not the businesses to blame . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the knowledge of knowledge , the manufacturing companies meets no immediate fault .
rather , it must be due to the measure of illegal practices of service companies with economic damage .
as always there is in the crop for little controversy .
is there only a lack of personal responsibility or competence ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 per cent .
it is precisely because of this , a consequ@@ ent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist , of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already highlighted several times that I expect a seamless education from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the regular alarm system at food waste really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and transpor@@ ting food .
if a non @-@ cured insec@@ ti@@ cide in the food industry is used , consumer and consumer are rightly disgu@@ ised .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the programmed funds manufacturers , distributors and consumers are into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food labels is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .
it must be done consistently at all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the fact is quickly elu@@ sive and un@@ brid@@ geable .
how the financial rules of football have to affect Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ obstruc@@ ted issues of European football , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power , cre@@ ws of access to the most prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A in 2011 , means that P@@ SG must show sometime that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without large losses .
Barcelona has paid € 2@@ 22 million ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
P@@ SG can safely make the money loose so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich mist@@ ress of Qatar .
clubs may apply to players a lot of money to acquire players , but they must be controlled with legitimate objection sources , which allow them to allow the break @-@ point in their on the football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs that had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success , effectively de@@ fraud and ris@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P took the attention to the debts of the clubs for the monitoring of their losses .
the amendment meant that the business model , the Roman A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invest heavily to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses from EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini was fallen by the presidency in Bel@@ gn@@ ade , its UEF@@ A successor will continue to di@@ vul@@ ge Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending .
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ fal@@ so , who is responsible at UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week .
although the P@@ SG has paid the buy @-@ out clause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ ices over the duration of its contract .
Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a 5 @-@ year contract , so that the resolution can be transferred for the next five years to the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the year .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the P@@ SG together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the P@@ SG received a penalty of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are eligible for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual normal 25 player .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to ou@@ tw@@ ave their financial perspectives by connecting their revenues by companies who are connected to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could be sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SG if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income .
exactly that happened 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsorship of the P@@ SA was collected by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it has been reported that a part of the P@@ SG payments to G@@ ym@@ ar on payments of the Organ@@ s Committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
but P@@ SG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar Cup amb@@ ass@@ adors will be able to find and such a man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could easily figure out .
the previous sanctions against P@@ SG mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to notice any attempt to byp@@ ass the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with P@@ SG about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , sag@@ ging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the P@@ SG situation .
the last published reports show that P@@ SG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .
P@@ SG expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ics .
the association assumes that sales after the signature of at least 30 percent is rising .
the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers to see and she tried to avoid Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s dri@@ ch by claiming that P@@ SG would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financing dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of P@@ SG .
arsen@@ al Manager of Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State that financed an association .
&quot; it is the consequence of the land@@ lady , and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football for the past 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday .
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financing of Fair@@ play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss Life is searching for a new shock supplier
in the past years , Cho@@ col@@ ate Fre@@ y Board has been produced for Swiss Life .
now , the work is presented in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract anew .
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ red confirmed on request from the newspaper agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northern Germany &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the Air@@ line will launch a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spe@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white sand@@ boards reach 14 grams per year the flight ladder from landing to the passengers .
Swiss Life wanted no information about the costs .
in@@ sider estimate the order volume according to &quot; northwest speaking &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achie@@ ves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more importantly , the advertising effect is more important : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious mission .
how many applicants were there for the new tender , the Swiss wants to betra@@ y it .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to take a renewal of the contract beyond spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA was the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer not available for an opinion .
chocolate boards distri@@ butes Swiss Life since 2006 on board their flights .
before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablet .
the possibility to place the logo , Swiss started off two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
the First Class passengers are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie jumps , in the business class wal@@ lets passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also in the short distance Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia go into &quot; W@@ et hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is nostal@@ gically due to the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ he @-@ year @-@ gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ age the Sk@@ et@@ ch com@@ edy ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 before their stars , as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ ody and an embodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as Franchise feels , the time would be short .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for promising d@@ ose vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by moving at the core of the g@@ ags - actors middle aged men play s@@ cour@@ le children , who will grow up - they still managed to gain the possibility of winning the last part of the wid@@ ows .
&quot; ten Years later , &quot; with his adult , which are now grown @-@ up , is less emotional rooted and his par@@ ody goes more after the casting principle , including a riff for the Stal@@ ker &apos;s films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , who looked at the cradle &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point you have a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ age ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) .
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost its vir@@ gin@@ ity .
and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ ignant P@@ lot , included in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ old ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well known impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the courses are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it makes especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singles &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ usion that could take this franchise like a sort of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I &apos;ll show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twist Years later , &quot; how she will show the premiere of &quot; W@@ et hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; to the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ low &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Q@@ at@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , together with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , there is a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main glasses - a hard sk@@ inn@@ ed Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ ose@@ f - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dialogue of ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be syn@@ ced in English .
it is an in@@ geni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice days for watching ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , such as Americans now do it football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ der &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda emergency - a mur@@ derer , who carries a Re@@ agan mask , will be involved - that it often plays like a single one .
in six long episodes there are gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was neg@@ ated to a smaller length , could better supply its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ ose@@ f always come back to the American message whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ oured a bunch of bur@@ gers .
the message for the ima@@ g@@ assing communist public is that Western culture can make everything for a spring .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
impact on drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police have been a blow to the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar @-@ district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , const@@ ancy , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart were searched numerous objects , such as the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance on Friday afternoon .
15 sec@@ ts were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years and had already en@@ acted un@@ warran@@ t against this .
moreover , the officials put greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundreds of thousands of dollars .
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects , there were German arrest warran@@ t .
therefore the two are probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
in the campaign Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the members of the ma@@ fia becomes organised drug crime , severe violence , tried murder , as well as rob@@ bery and black@@ mailing .
already since the summer of 2016 , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s Con@@ stance against organised drug @-@ trade in the South @-@ German region .
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an inspir@@ ational exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .
therefore , the big effort on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
in the sight of the investigations , above all , Italian national nationality related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ b@@ began where several shots were fired into a restaurant at the early morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
how large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ Registry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : one report , the foreig@@ ner tab in Germany has considerable shortcomings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lead to some serious lack of lack of lack of asylum procedures .
the dra@@ fting for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen mode , has taken attention to a media report , according to large gaps in the country of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the registered data could lead to asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to some serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an analysis that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Register , it is estimated that ten million people are captured with foreign citizenship , including about 5.5 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data were not adequately taken care , the data quality in parts has not been very good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer show in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faul@@ ty data transmis@@ sions can significantly slow@@ down substantially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the statistics about travelling people there are EU citizens that would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false concessions but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led to a distorted debate about how to deal with out@@ flow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is therefore in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the German government began to send refugee @-@ families with 16 @-@ year old children back to Italy when they arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this appears from an internal paper of the Federal Minister for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this paper the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper has a reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the Dublin agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if an migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the eland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the reason is now : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the entrance capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ Cr@@ t@@ HR ) hold these commitments for sufficient .
other EU states would also leave refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
the interiors of political spokes@@ man in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision , &quot; families with children thre@@ aten because of the in@@ adequ@@ acies in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful mounting conditions and a haz@@ ard of childhood . &quot;
second @-@ best result is achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living people are already available for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were welcomed on Friday .
meanwhile , Jürgen W@@ owl , who has meanwhile shared 100 litres of blood with his meanwhile 100 litres of blood .
traditionally , the community at the meeting of the Council have multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is genius how our body is laid out for it and we appl@@ aud the donations , which provide their blood for foreigners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood @-@ saving helps multiple people , &quot; explained the circle coordinator of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves are de@@ composed into its components .
this is how three people could benefit from a blood circulation .
at the same time Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported of the actions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year we achieved with 114 don@@ ors the second best result , &quot; said the DR@@ K Kreis@@ ner manager .
obviously , the change to the theatre house took place a few years ago to higher cont@@ est@@ ants .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Scho@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a w@@ berry to the multi @-@ specialist cal@@ ms and were awarded for each 50 years .
half so many sold Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mmer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll , and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ l@@ iter of her life saf@@ es .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates by 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England will probably be announced later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation is decreasing the speculation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contracts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; when they held the interest rates on family income in the midst of an ampli@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereby less members reached a rise in this month since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on the bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , whereby the inflation in the autumn is expected to rise to just under 3 % .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years Zin@@ ser@@ mo@@ cks would be necessary to breed the inflation of the Bre@@ xit and said that the credit costs may possibly be more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a portion of the Mamm@@ ut business package which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February , even though it is expected that it will make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Ster@@ ling .
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pre@@ diction of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak as pressure on the real income of households continues to impe@@ de the consumption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the interest rates they repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ lication of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is needed for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slightly larger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets predicted the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
the Bank emphasized however that increases are &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and the next year are projected in a forecast of 1.9 % and 1,@@ 7 % compared to the growth forecasts for this and the next year .
it has retained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to this news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell about 0,5 % to 1,@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to no change is coming after the recent dis@@ closing growth pay the rising expectations on a interest rate and GDP increased by 0.@@ 2 % in the previous three months in the previous three months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
growth is expected to increase by 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by an increasing inflation and low prices down , as the tigh@@ tening first is worse before it is better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it added that monetary policy could not prevent monetary policy during the coming years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it imp@@ lied that wages will recover from the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods which is due to the weakness of weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the sound .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
in front of the last judgment of the Bank on interest rates the reputation has risen by a interest rate since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ mounted households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanding a rise to 0.5 % .
inflation has declined last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
the Bank said the passage in relation to its goal of 2 % is to be allocated to the weak pound of pounds .
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; given the recent return of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the len@@ ders firm looking strongly to stores and want to end the year in a positive way .
the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing de@@ parts are running out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are close , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) aims to pres@@ cribe more controversial HIV @-@ drug than 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment for September from September following a fight against funding of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England revealed that a pre @-@ employed preventive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) which can decrease the infection risk in high risk @-@ risk measures , now delivered by health service over a first three @-@ year study for 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice in the past year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that local authorities should fund it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) in the &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced to England in April 2018 .
prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV infection from infection types .
taking an EP prior to having sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs may be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .
those who come for the treatment into question include pregnant or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated successfully .
in clinics the appropriate participants identified , which will agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status is not known as anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of the European Parliament by analy@@ sing clinical evidence as it is highly targeted and implemented in a large scale .
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts of preventing HIV supplement and over@@ hau@@ l HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in addressing one of humanity &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is targeted at most vulnerable and endangered people , the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from September to people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiating with a partner which leads to the improvement of many , many lives .
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority has to be done so that the study is rapidly carried out throughout the country and that no one has left a risk for HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EP test &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow @-@ Health Minister said : &quot; the start of the Pr@@ ison process is welcome and hesit@@ ant after months of delay and hesit@@ ant realization through the government .
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of such life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of the EP .
now , it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to step closer to the spread of HIV in society .
the big life live : me@@ zz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , was taken in 2014 by a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their pockets and sold her bags .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this flat in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ ying storage space and a me@@ zz@@ anine to best use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my request , &quot; she says .
for this purpose they assigned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill , to make use of 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home which was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on each other , allowing the architectural challenge to create a me@@ zz@@ anine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think creative in order to release the assignment .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were ski@@ pped each other without having to decorate them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down . &quot;
this order allows it to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama .
for the me@@ zz@@ anine a classic copper light of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous area .
vocal finishes , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illum@@ ination expos@@ ing the style to the program .
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a quick corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to make it longer work .
the kitchen feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance we provide carp@@ eted units place for all seating and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a glam@@ orous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of Ingenieur@@ kunst went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , frigh@@ tened M@@ DF door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is equi@@ vo@@ cally important , so if you push the door highly , very easy it leads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne offers extra 16 m ² , one additional bedroom and added layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; Er@@ fan says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and create a calculation based on bottom size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical so@@ ckets of the walls .
these are important , but they are not playing with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of somewhat standard into something very astonishing .
in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fighting for less than 500 million US dollars
two brothers are located four decades after her Italian family founded the dynasty , in an examination of one of the largest real estate imperial Vic@@ tori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and its assets are to be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice .
together with her mother Anna the brothers have collected 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood , since 1973 .
there , the family of West@@ co founded Je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with its late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; was described in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s character and Paul about one third .
a judicial system states that col@@ in property retains the value of 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the worth of 17@@ 6 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in proposed it with what I thought for the best objects &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it 2015 in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday past Friday , the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers also fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but casts Paul before , to manage some possessions .
in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to bring about the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage is written that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the cost increases in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides of the law firm .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ acy from the late 1950 @-@ 0s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick &apos;s early 1970s .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood Property , in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ ing of the family opened .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co , when he was &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says she died and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their children .
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial , &quot; she wrote .
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group of companies , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark on aband@@ on@@ ment of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million were paid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of its financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in has changed very well although he was a former AF@@ L pre @-@ board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very , very sorry that my brother Paul decided to shor@@ ten me and drag our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote .
in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father did not want to say that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be solved in the near future by courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ umps of new Stab@@ le@@ f is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Daw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff of the White House , at his first working day , he welcomed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he wants to repair : bad information that got into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ fing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
wa@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ump Tr@@ ump by monitoring its media .
President Tr@@ umps relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong .
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs , which were to convince , &quot; the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Key to hold Tr@@ umps Twitter habit in control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media intake includes a constant praise price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ umps is ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridiculous .
perhaps these fighters @-@ g@@ ators know something we do not know others - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets had even more f@@ ath@@ ic without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the Tr@@ ump is not sent .
if his employees have succeeded in holding it away from him for several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .
but nobody has consistently prevent it that Tr@@ ump controversy calls out .
part of the problem is that people in a white house , which sets off from competing parties , always try to move their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ors to conduct the President for strategic reasons without question@@ able information .
this was an example which was described by repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , above all such with damaged le@@ aks and that he tends to figure out where these originate .
exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of mali@@ cious a printed copy of an article of Got@@ news@@ .com , the site of the Internet provo@@ cation in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was ban@@ ished due to har@@ es from Twitter or that he did not have any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump reading the article and started to ask employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ makers added that the then staff member Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his consultants still seek influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the assistance of the population is praying and hoped .
the police in all of Europe can be ma@@ iled in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
since the addresses of the requested criminals could not be known as in accordance with , will gain indications from the population and pray .
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; calendar from winter .
the experiences have shown that many p@@ oul@@ try to hide holiday destinations , was it part of the Euro@@ pol .
you have collected 21 post@@ cards for requested criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 it has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted to visit more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requested could have been arrested , at least eleven thereof , due to references to the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; Million@@ aires @-@ Series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some compens@@ ated travelers on war broke , which negotiated one from the municipality of drawn dit@@ ch to rec@@ ap@@ ort a box in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; million@@ th series . &quot;
they brought with horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , having been ki@@ cked out of late May , without being de@@ ported from one by the Council to prevent their accidents .
the tak@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and thrust their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; desol@@ ate inhabitants have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; useless &quot; to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are pulled there on Monday night after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw those stones on the pas@@ sers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be obliged to put into action by shame , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long instruction to protect their parks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to keep my com@@ mon@@ d expensive if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who did not want to be called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ person at the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of a un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that many inhabitants subscribe to an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former hotel Birken@@ hof , the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closing of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience Oper@@ ating company mbH and the 13th of April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by tourist tax .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the rising numbers of refugees , the hotel building has been offered as a collective accommodation , which was controversial for controversial discussions .
the city prevented accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but in particular , Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts Ober@@ may@@ meister Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the location of the hotel and then spoke of serious interested parties in the house .
he was supposed to keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ er &apos;s company with its headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former hotel Birken@@ hof in a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former hotel Birken@@ hof have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the so@@ ils were swe@@ pt out , blankets partly down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do in March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ ans in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are fitted with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area will be converted , new windows are installed .
everything sol@@ ves later &quot; beautiful bourgeois , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer pus@@ hes .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the equipment .
it doesn &apos;t want to position itself on the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale downtown level , empha@@ sizes sh@@ ank .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are spacious , explains the amount of she@@ ers .
both individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism dire@@ ktor Michael Kr@@ ause he already led , so Sch@@ ager .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are on the same line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to define exactly .
nearly under a million Euros , he reck@@ on .
also the outdoor facilities are brought forward to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard comes a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant which is publicly available .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ aires : U.S. Special Jury for Grand Jury
in the Russia affair about US President Donald Tr@@ ump , he has to have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury for a report on a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
in recent weeks the panel was recorded in recent weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote on appeal to the cause of familiar persons .
the newspaper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded his investigations and intensified .
the sender of CN@@ N reported that there were already first inv@@ it@@ ations of the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services accused the Krem@@ lin for prolonged , targeted in the Presidential campaign in 2016 .
mu@@ eller studied , whether there were paragrap@@ hs between Tr@@ umps election team and Moscow .
the investig@@ ates will be a number of men who acted in the election campaign as advisor of the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ umps , private and corporate surroundings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Scottish Tr@@ ump has moved into the center and asked the accus@@ ation , whether the President prevented the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to check this evidence in possible waste , and to decide whether charges are to be charged .
Grand Y@@ y@@ ys are therefore also called Pro@@ secution .
mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on from the Public Pro@@ sec@@ utor to invite people for engaging under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N channels have already been issued pre @-@ inv@@ it@@ ations , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report .
additionally , they should provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ umps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law Jar@@ ed Kus@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign Paul Man@@ afort .
right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the installation show that Mu@@ eller should not let go down in his work and that he should be necessary to act fast .
however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned up at the end to decide on the trial of an indictment .
nevertheless , the replacement of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump .
amid the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; the Russia @-@ history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the Democrats a way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good to feel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b commented in an opinion , he didn &apos;t know anything about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
but this work also commonly performed in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advocate all measures that accelerated the work of a special agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former F@@ BI boss James Com@@ ey did three times said that not against the president .
I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it was in the explanation ahead .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to this re@@ pro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become loud , nor did he want to impe@@ de the judiciary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump urged him to have asked him a stance of investigations against the then national security consultant . Michael Fl@@ ynn .
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
in the presentation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special er@@ ters and its employees .
the dissolved speculation over that if Tr@@ ump mu@@ eller was released .
unlike an independent special feature of the congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later returned President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position where he could theoretically could be fired at the President of the Federal Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties wish to predomin@@ ate such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft law on Thursday after which the Special Off@@ ers could no longer be dis@@ missed .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ice@@ berg drives in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has solved itself from the narro@@ w@@ ly size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
the shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar@@ - and Se@@ on Research with Wednesday .
the more than one tri@@ llion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers major pist@@ on driving now to the north and will need two , three years until he mel@@ ted .
with 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it has been one of the largest ice giant that the researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger to people from him .
to what extent climate change has played a role in the break @-@ up of the ice@@ berg , is still unclear .
overall , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the US @-@ Research Centre for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fac@@ ts@@ i background .
according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming .
the now broken pist@@ on was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America nearly at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this shot was the balance of wax and vom@@ iting a few years ago .
a full sc@@ rap is torn there , writes AW@@ I scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there are some reasons that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the leading edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently .
also , the ice @-@ plate stand up under tension and can fall , if at a key set of slow@@ down .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ice@@ berg increases the sea level not because they float on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it yields after the f@@ use itself .
however , the loss of shame leads to the fact that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before .
that could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a very low extent , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( MID@@ AS ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is according to AW@@ I data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth biggest sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
although there is a natural happening and not a direct connection to climate change , the ice@@ sign comes into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most advanced retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under scientists may be disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will be back again or long @-@ term , and potentially collap@@ sed , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even though these researchers did not withdraw the advent of this gigantic ice@@ berg not on climate change , so in the last decades a lot of ice @-@ cl@@ ut@@ ches of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are dis@@ inf@@ ested .
this long ornam@@ ent of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has been dated around 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drop in temperature have contributed to the decline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Antar@@ c@@ tica peninsula has gone by around three degrees over the past 50 years and were t@@ amed to the areas in which the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants to get Hau@@ star@@ if near the staff
because it &apos;s getting more difficult to fill @-@ free spots , call the CD@@ U to step out of the employer association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break the cre@@ ag has ra@@ ined 41 new jobs in administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now even 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves .
the cur@@ riculum with the circle are obviously very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were available for the places this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers are employed as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ W@@ G initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is intended to work out a concept of recruitment and recruitment during the request of the parties . &quot;
the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term need for skilled workers but to counter@@ act forward @-@ proof of the application scar@@ city , it is called .
the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside , to indicate concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include an figur@@ ative offensive , calling CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ W@@ G .
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has it with staff problems that you didn &apos;t know earlier .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is by a down@@ right &quot; contest of the public employer . &quot;
this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ related causes of service .
highest time for action thus , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ ers , leader of the CD@@ U , continues his party with his party .
he had long ago already been in the f@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he en@@ ched publicly on the staff and the other parties were ast@@ ounding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all nations want to be reviewed that all possibilities allow a res@@ ignation from the local Emplo@@ yers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come in short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should be entitled to trade unions - maybe also in cooperation with the European cities - an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hau@@ star@@ if &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CD@@ U is trying to pay better for employees and officials than it sees the collective bar@@ gaining of the public service .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money only if you change in a higher level , which is oriented at professional years .
the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which to deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law .
last but not least by increasing numbers of asylum seekers , coun@@ cill@@ ors Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direc@@ tor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ating the tone to NGO @-@ migrants life@@ jacket
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs , the b@@ ail@@ out boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue it if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner Daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; youth Savi@@ or &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
the aid organisation that has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself to detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor of Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , it remains our top priority to save the human life . we are very sorry that we can not operate in the search and the rescue area in the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can judge all alleg@@ ations that are currently being collected , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; youth &apos; , the Iu@@ v@@ enta , who have been monitoring in October .
it is assumed that his crew takes the din@@ gh@@ y migrants to board , delivered them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that s@@ mug@@ gler can leave them , so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles in front of the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose content was published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to confront the authority of the Italian coastal state , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other moti@@ fs .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iu@@ v@@ enta also need to have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been prepared to keep on the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they wouldn &apos;t make any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refused to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates organization doctors without limits ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy during the last few weeks , the efforts to reinforce the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and tri@@ c@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest @-@ drivers met in Gro@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to spend four days in Tri@@ als and sights .
three friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ au heimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle , above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
the point of view , partly on towers , of which one could look far over the Pf@@ alz Forest and the prehistoric levels .
in between there were always extended asc@@ ents to reward for the long tri@@ c@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to sal@@ ine and to the popular saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , the viewpoint at the point of view , linked to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate pi@@ cks . &quot; &quot; &quot;

console instead of lawn - Bundesliga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in the future sit before computer consoles instead of going through in wind and weather over the stadium ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ages .
these have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ des that are increasingly engaged in this area .
in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ FL Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department founded and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 took under control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire quite new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says CEO of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is certain that there are several clubs in this move . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the next weekend of FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the gam@@ ers of different clubs each other . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , such as Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eind@@ hoven quali@@ fies .
Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people continue to go to the stadium in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract you could be more often present on these markets online than once in the year the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ as to Asia .
what is this exactly ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; computer games are computer games like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; League Of Le@@ gends &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even the football simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
long ago , as in normal sport also , li@@ gen is established , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the Asian @-@ games , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is this a correct sport ?
for many , the performance is safe to make .
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long faced a question with the question .
for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress actions , hormonal changes .
it also need cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick response .
professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console , but also train their body and pay attention to the diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ rob@@ ous also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform at online play , and in the scene the structures of classical sport failed .
positive highlights the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
the players are on the road internationally , this is like a big global family , there is no intercultural mis@@ understandings .
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ aktive Book software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
in 2016 , it was 50 million euros to be implemented in Germany , primarily on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments .
in three years , turnover should be at 130 million .
the only 2.4 billion euros in the Bundesliga is low .
however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors &quot; write .
international countries are already going on .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez join the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school this e @-@ sport was introduced as lessons , says F@@ rob@@ ous .
in the Netherlands and in France the premi@@ er @-@ league associations according to Dut@@ t has now been obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison to Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann .
only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to be clarified , today is no longer sufficient .
it &apos;s about preserving the tradition of society , but the company at the same time align the modern market .
&quot; we are living in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; also Dut@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you cannot cling to that only when football stays as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the texts , the Con@@ rad Roy , for suici@@ de , condem@@ ns
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend through texts and calls for suici@@ de .
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind G@@ it@@ ters and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Carter was sentenced in June for the kill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free up to the appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years but their legal representatives argued that both she suffered as Mr Roy in a mental illness .
in red pants and a cre@@ me@@ colored bl@@ ouse dressed , Carter was standing with tears in the eyes , with fur@@ ious hands and to the bottom oriented eyes as it was condemned .
&quot; their actions have taken Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor of the court .
&quot; she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it has no responsibility &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ ue shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ avan said a lawyer , it is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; circumstance she fully depl@@ orable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day , in which I am not sad@@ dened the loss of my beloved son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want it to be proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain , which we will carry with us for eternity , for his sisters there &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be prosec@@ uted from the knowledge that she would never take part in the marriage of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children .
&quot; no more this only person to have with whom I was together with me since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep in mind for the rest of my life , &quot; she said .
the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit another , suici@@ de , suici@@ de .
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon mon@@ oxide in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention when Car@@ ters statements revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hanging on Spring of a building , you get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suici@@ de , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All you have to do is to switch the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Carter was looking attention through the death of Roy , and orda@@ ined that she was sol@@ dered by any press by the case .
the case has the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 because of murder in their British room@@ mate , before she was acqu@@ itted of two years ago .
MS Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua for me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run for me with the Audi Cup as captain , is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern dar@@ ken@@ ed to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation was not mistaken .
anything else was there differently on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua for me immediately , even though the additional gar@@ ment was very , very small .
but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself the Bin@@ de halt on the arm .
&quot; the coach did not have it announced , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain .
well , the deposit could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from Coach could also indicate me this way .
not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was born in those of teenagers , Deb@@ ate and especially from the holiday spent professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as game leaders , but he .
su@@ gar@@ s are most often distributed to those who are a lot to keep in mood .
those who were chosen to establish the heritage of Lah@@ m , can only use a small extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m above the box .
to the right rear , that is now its position , the white tank on the arm did its rest .
and at all , I would like to im@@ itate me in this run@@ way like the one who can take control of the ruin .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ finished tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the Wh@@ ole , while many others were busy with himself .
V@@ idal therewith , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( fol@@ dable hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches thus , to tie in the services of Asia @-@ Travel ( fol@@ dable only partially ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as South , in order not to dis@@ miss in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
the still fol@@ dable very well .
Sü@@ le ran beside me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agile sovereign .
the nam@@ eless occupied Nap@@ oli wind was often difficult , in addition , South Africa was also trying to meet a few times in the game building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave me that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even he showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; play@@ back , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also caught up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how un@@ accustomed to this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw afterwards the game .
Ru@@ dy for example gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but surely six or seven interviews .
for a few scarce statements made in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase , &quot; what is going on here , I have already noted .
in Bavaria you just need to win any game . &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new one more .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies

company content with the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Minister : economy praise wisdom speed
it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) and Economic Affairs in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
this is reflected in office after more than one year in which the new Minister for Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
Cham@@ bers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ inquiry from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ames at the same time the old ministries .
Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to the Lem@@ ke all blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the complete road between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the pri@@ ori@@ ental list of the country now quite up .
this year the Ministry is hoping for a planetary procedure , to 2021 the construction is to stand right .
a role in the plans of the country also plays the West byp@@ assing Tri@@ er , which stands in an urgent need for the Federal Government .
the aim is to take the track in operation in December 2020 , says minister@@ ial speaker in Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees it a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er aims to boost the vines as a Rhein@@ land @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .
moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to start their own business commen@@ cing the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
provided a premium of 1000 euros for the constitu@@ ent Master of Master and 2500 Euro , if graduates are independent within 10 years of master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the scheduled road construction are quick facts to create , at the same time , it l@@ acked it to the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive director of the I@@ BC@@ Tri@@ er .
of 56 new engineers who wants to adjust the knowledge of the country &apos;s mobility , have been occupied until 29 positions so far .
the Chamber of Industry demands more orders to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ Le@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bald@@ auf refers to calculations by the accounting system , the country &apos;s investment 2017 and 2018 , more than 20 million euros less in the conservation of national roads .
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
serious broad@@ band is also in the country as a result of the previous broad@@ band cultivation .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the note of 3.4 .
you describe sc@@ aling Internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
at the moment Ex @-@ Economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , at the moment , is out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green &amp; D Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where it has already set up the field after four months due to un@@ votes .
Audi should change a 80@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a counter @-@ reaction
a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would be offering to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW @-@ president said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are intelligent options as driver restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limit vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but the nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers , plants to neutr@@ alize the sales of diesel vehicles , take charge as well , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful autoimmune companies and ignore signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that regulate emissions in order to comply with regulations when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month the former manager of the company mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and therefore is not protected from delivery and could be put to trial in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities used Audi to byp@@ ass the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could strain Volkswagen heavy : the luxury car manufacturer carries an over@@ proportion to the profit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on the Is@@ ar on Saturday
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
as a result , the is@@ ar @-@ visitors also take a raft through Munich , which has a special message on the mor@@ day Saturday .
if there is a big raft on the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Reichen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building refer@@ at wants to open up .
on the raft you can see a great Inf@@ otran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo has been one of the best @-@ published carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 marks the Argent@@ inian yet and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ er@@ mo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he suggested himself as an artist for lucky cards - what it was frustr@@ ating .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris joined him at the end of the 60s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paris Match &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then also in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire you .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the s@@ late Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , he is still sitting in the drawing room on the early morning , working on every day almost ten hours .
about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches will continue to find his lo@@ l@@ ent figures continue to spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any test@@ es animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ pi@@ s@@ s@@ ler as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures are talking in the 3D movie , which is expected to come to the movie screen .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
therefore he uses more to the TV series , which , like its original desig@@ nations , is produced .
la@@ ven@@ der is threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is due to dro@@ ught remin@@ ders of dro@@ ught and due to the tick @-@ borne insects backward , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to find great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agricultural research institutes CR@@ IE@@ P@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender del in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the last few years , which in spring has brought much less rain and in the autumn much more .
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf @-@ cades , and with very dry weather , there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ m said , &quot; instead of having very long plant breeding with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened .
so we have fewer parts of the oil . &quot;
among the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the improvement of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of sorts which are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ ür@@ sti@@ cal R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating his 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
Fes@@ tivities is this Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval dinner .
cro@@ mer , ig@@ h , dealers , vag@@ ant or a country @-@ office are to be experienced in these days in the city center .
the assass@@ ination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly paper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce is usually meeting in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change her routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what will feel safer : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the target of an attack with gran@@ ates , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , allies .
they ask the re@@ porter , to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal tone .
there are drug mug@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the side@@ ts@@ list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest @-@ break from the violence , and throughout the country the bodies of cor@@ p@@ ses are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a Nie@@ to came to office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are following terms and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
under the latter , your editor and the inspir@@ er of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his lack is felt deep though its presence is everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows its medium @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , who show its smiling face with glasses or its typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although 2010 was established a Son@@ der @-@ Federal Ministry in order to edit the cases of journalists , it initiated only two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee to protect journalists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders that are linked each year with drug @-@ trade and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely challenged .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are barren and although the terrain is still available .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting of the discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we suspi@@ cion of all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced by two men . he was shot out of his car , and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ v@@ th river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and the delivery into the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t slaughter of the country , because rival factions are fighting here to fill a vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of ated , two @-@ story mouse ole@@ ans for drugs , which are bigger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drugs trading routes in the United States has .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understandings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival filters in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , gu@@ essed car@@ es bought each copy of the issue once they have been delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was that Val@@ dez does not force to comp@@ el the same story after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which has published the same story to leave the country at its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his kill@@ ings is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues em@@ ulate that he would always be there .
he had worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the h@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and revenue and advertising .
repor@@ ters loved it to be hard @-@ ahead investigations without fear of cens@@ or@@ ship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he was voluntary to believe that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento on the last October .
&quot; you have to take the task that you as a journalist drops - either that or you play the Dum@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do with so many things ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team mixed Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wn @-@ bird , who was like a harbour workers , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go there always sit at the same table .
well , she ask her : was his love for routine to ruin ?
his death also brought her to question her own assumptions on how to best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their c@@ anny and run@@ ways , to move drugs .
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ preservation .
your own instinc@@ ts trust .
when it smells wrong , keep away from it .
the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the employees met from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce to security training , were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days previously became known that Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
they sought two polic@@ emen from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the government government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a vi@@ ti@@ ary building in a mid @-@ story building of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who are Gover@@ nor themselves as trustworthy .
it has been months since the Reporter has gone into the mountains , where the drug development are de facto under control .
for the edition of this week , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has given three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the hometown of the govern@@ ors .
and there was a group which led to one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the Pro@@ sec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or as it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug traffi@@ ckers and authorities .
a re@@ porter was drawn from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled almost the entire century all political levels .
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the Reporter to write about previous incidents in this e@@ at@@ ery , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ man &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack .
only a few months before , readers would have seen the colum@@ n@@ ist of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before we had already knew what happened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something that they themselves have never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ters Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez got a few signs and went on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is of its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole country journalists have become sound@@ ly stronger by having written in organised protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SOS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on pav@@ ement and construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a , on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pronoun@@ ce journalists and make them change because they said the truth .
she has since then asked for her to be divided by the government , because she is worried that her anger has hurt their obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico was surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security guards , organized with organised crime under a blan@@ ket .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Artic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you have , because they want you to dis@@ rupt the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez .
obviously the murder have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as , in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ etas @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer stat@@ or and ear@@ phones lay in addition to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as there was El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo L@@ are@@ do according to the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez made public the drug collection with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home states , or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they will hunt , as evi@@ dently , the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who want to stay back and continue the work , it &apos;s a daily dance with risk of risks .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be Po@@ ets , gives to the fact that drug trafficking are frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was repor@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already ended , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , than once all their phones started to sum@@ mon@@ ed .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with Band@@ enri@@ v@@ alen and security guards in the vicinity of the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed deaths .
the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell emb@@ assies in the region .
from the boarding edge , they have published the news on the site of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ dges in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the polic@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid they did not show it .
under the vast portrait of the Fallen Fo@@ under , the newspaper whose medium @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; how can you also remember to close it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day she was assass@@ inated , the tra@@ ine@@ eship asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dinosau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to differ its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , though a terri@@ fying .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain@@ e@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa , Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well preserved that they could even realize that his energetic skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something from a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drew him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most bar@@ gaining ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was ever found and one of the best dinosau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well preserv@@ ative condition has researchers , which it can be described as &quot; really remarkable &quot;
according to reports in National Geographic , the plant @-@ based plant @-@ feed is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn funk on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , mine .
he met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more precisely .
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy @-@ cl@@ ums@@ y .
after all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you just flas@@ hing a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it is going to enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved dinosau@@ rs - Mon@@ a Lisa , the dinosau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with armor and a changing tank , probably the meat @-@ eating dinosau@@ r has been threatened .
the strongly arm@@ oured dinosau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an tan@@ king technology that is known as a counter@@ part , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to mix better in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , say experts , sug@@ gesting that it was threatened by major dinosau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs made its headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild beast and known it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta with Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to un@@ cover it carefully .
the ast@@ ounding preservation of the specimen allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of scales and armor on his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ atti@@ cation , a widespread Defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ atti@@ ing is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the animals living today .
it points out that the dinosau@@ rs hun@@ ted from enough pressure by meat @-@ end dinosau@@ rs , that the evolution fav@@ ored the vei@@ led of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use counter @-@ atti@@ ture - think of deer , zeb@@ ras and gir@@ d@@ ots - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs was exposed to a real struggle for survival .
&quot; strong beast @-@ animal behaviour on a massive , strongly @-@ ar@@ mor@@ ed dinosau@@ rs show how dangerous the dinosau@@ rs of predat@@ ors have to have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; said Brown .
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosau@@ r is brown .
scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his consistent showing , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe the dinosau@@ rs when he died , went into a river and went out into the sea where it sank to the sea to the sea .
at that time , Alberta was as warm as southern today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserv@@ ative skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast , &quot; said Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you do not need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with the eyes , you could almost believe he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous dinosau@@ rs , which stood on two legs , the earth crossed .
although the king of them , the tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus rex , millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta lived , the arm@@ oured dinosau@@ rs hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this belongs to Acro@@ pro@@ th@@ rot@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was pl@@ ank after death in the sea and was converted to mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn funk on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , mine .
according to the museum it is the most ar@@ se @-@ ar@@ ed dinosau@@ rs of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hips .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ ghed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch @-@ long tops that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant @-@ feed by the Western Canada was s@@ war@@ med down , until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea .
but the underwater price of the dinosau@@ r kept his armor in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy armor plate down the dinosau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in Lot@@ to .
the more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied resistance of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy armor plate , which carry the skull of the animal .
his re@@ chter &apos;s front is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass am@@ bol@@ on@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
fierce accident on Thursday night on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass am@@ bol@@ on@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , kilom@@ et@@ ric steel and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people have been wounded on the late Thursday afternoon .
after the first information provided by the police at 17.@@ 00 pm between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , almost 30 cars , including the trucks , there are probably also trucks .
on the exact number of recent publishers there were no information .
it is light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ person .
a large range of b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident scene .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of riding Munich a couple of ten kilometers long back@@ st@@ au formed .
like a AZ re@@ porter , it also came on the opposite way to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire@@ bri@@ gade notes the hall@@ marks of the vehicle &apos;s cars , who have now reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
here it was a collision between a car , spor@@ adi@@ c and a truck .
a rescue @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter was on the way to the accident scene .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just an in@@ geni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
does the creative work come from an uns@@ an@@ ft or her@@ t the driver in the middle of the work@@ flow .
ticket @-@ card control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test the job@@ less ticket control .
you simply confirm your phone that you have taken up your seat and thus value the ticket .
there is currently a test run on two routes .
&quot; come with the offer , we expand it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many more remote races in Germany at the beginning of next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is the way the train de@@ valuation without the de@@ valuation .
in order to be able to use , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already the most passengers do .
one must also have purchased it via the app of rail , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket sales .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works as follows : one gets up in the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the test customer a button for electronic de@@ valuation appears .
the traction Manager will get on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and has taken off seat Y .
if the train driver is in the vehicle control at square Y , he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already paid online ticket .
one can thus continue to sleep , continue to keep on silent .
the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who relaxed without a ticket control through our train service , check out the DB Navigator software . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this enables the passengers to shape their travel time in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who often runs rail , knows that apart from delays and missed by the road safety controls to the biggest nu@@ ances .
because often you have , in any case , however , one of the fellow travelers are not all the documents that you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the flow of personnel or otherwise a document that you have to indicate .
the result are endless discussions between train guides and chassis , which leads to bad mood in the waste or large room and delays in control of one &apos;s tickets and takes over time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this is also based on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further traction numbers on the same route are not released yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken to its core .
just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a mail of someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
be@@ wil@@ dered , because no one otherwise posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the manual @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saving on her tim@@ eline .
the R@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed , squ@@ ad live .
he beg@@ ged an image of Brow@@ n@@ le@@ blo@@ ly body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell with himself .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone in order to return to T@@ we@@ et later in the evening about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people , crying , and by a man who claimed to be a shield who bore a sign : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police have just killed my un@@ armed forces ! &quot;
she watched a live Fe@@ ed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an was faced with a group of prot@@ esters with a bar@@ bed dog .
in another video , she said , un@@ secured another poli@@ cem@@ an his rif@@ le and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell reminded of its statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt che@@ ering fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a flight back and went home the next day .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she finished her six @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in cinema from 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the viewpoint of the people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel was with her daughter who bore a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , after F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two were a conversation that they had inn@@ umerable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded me of what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you need to know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves .
even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience where she personally experienced no e@@ kl@@ at@@ ants , she is no different than the next black women child .
I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was transformed into a camp rather than activists waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags before and helped to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began to embrace a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after the 9th August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ souri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food safety and health inequalities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organ@@ ically .
it has all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening @-@ demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted only to document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came into mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of men , often by white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an explained recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , who have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collaborated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field that is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt @-@ Ins@@ assen .
his involvement brought the project closer together , along with six other locals , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us . we talk , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the revealed participant of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , how they fell in love and mar@@ ries their wife . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like nude , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and lau@@ ghed when saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability during this work and the human@@ ization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ is history repeated the role of black gay women in the broader black @-@ lives @-@ mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager , Martin in 2012 has shaped the film &quot; Black@@ big Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as pregnant .
&quot; black , gay men in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts .
black , sul@@ try women must bear the main last of all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , they insist that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a affir@@ mati@@ vely type of action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which Fer@@ rell was chosen as the heart of the movie . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front line , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands so much at stake .
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras have long gone from F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ ages of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that it calls their home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , they complain about a song and she feels bound to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to gain .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south bank of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itted from the first presentation in 2009 to the people of prop@@ onents and opponents .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; is the subject discussed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to say to the bit of the bit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nicole Schau@@ sten ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not need a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or simply plain : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; size wa@@ its ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the prop@@ onents rely on that a gallery will attract more customers into the city , of which also the rest of the shops take advantage , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ ede .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farmers market hall is available , in the 13 direct market entry .
the beginning of construction will be concluded .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed there is room with possibility of sitting outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying a weekly market hall for many years now .
mostly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always happy to be very happy .
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we have discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; if a direct market in a market hall can be moved in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but that is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva Kili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s why shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
clothing , shoes , d@@ ger@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find that su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many stores here are empty - some have been here for months and years .
since this is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least receive the market hall .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is largely offered by the producer and is ob@@ end@@ lessly clean .
as you can see , charging shops are located in a shopping center only of bigger companies , because the dor@@ sal rents are often not viable for a retailer .
too bad , special stores there is almost no more and that which is still remaining , will then also disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ als : &quot; a mall with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does it create the gh@@ ost Bit gallery before , to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it will simply not work .
and a shopping center that stands empty also no one needs .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer @-@ market riding there are thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a matching similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - that are hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , aus W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ ola and Haar@@ lem , that you were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st made a 35 @-@ year imprisonment of imprisonment , after having publicly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A matching similarity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united their professional competence in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and a indic@@ ative dis@@ student , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted through the algorithms analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and look out of the 30 portraits , like anyone with these genom@@ ic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and created the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , who has spoken about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the es@@ par@@ rot Act , computer acts and theft .
in the prison its image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a bas@@ kets , black @-@ white sel@@ fish@@ y , sitting in the cre@@ ing clearly on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ ous per@@ l carries - with which it was associated .
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 @-@ project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
it produced the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette bl@@ ers and che@@ wing g@@ um , that extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
that was the time when they received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; she led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition .
and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were given to un@@ equal letters , which in the course of two years were ex@@ chan@@ ted letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Supp@@ lement Images &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which would fores@@ ee a future in which President Chel@@ ation Proce@@ ed judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release was asked for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep in opening the exhibition at the opening of the exhibition and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump introduces a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et paths that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange tim@@ ing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
in one on the wall of the gallery , cre@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature , called &quot; i &quot; in its family name , is equipped with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is sex , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ ondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ wich of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the involvement of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing , at least in biological aspects , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories can also be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stories &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece of the exhibition , which is stored in an own space is a page from the above mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le .
she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a hands @-@ pre@@ diction in hand from the in@@ discipline bar@@ racks of the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they are speaking your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get ge@@ ese if I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic sim@@ ul@@ ls , which collap@@ ses like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
that was also focused , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ ins have been written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which is also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University because of killing .
a nationwide human @-@ hunt is now underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford which was considered to be susp@@ ects as a man has been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly wounds .
on Monday we exhibited for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ a ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) War@@ rant for murder due to their alleged involvement on the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the off@@ ences of the University of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several sticks .
a mention of the Chicago authorities published by Chicago , stating that the ly@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of the event for dead , and det@@ ective examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seeks the two susp@@ ects , they said officials .
La@@ o has been an extraordinary Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for Universitäts@@ Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them can now be consul@@ ted now and ruled by the end of the campus of North@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal issue that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and North@@ western University co @-@ operates during this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the US investigations into every conceivable way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said , he urged the susp@@ ects to challenge the susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the residents : &quot; police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian prime minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian prime minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
the W@@ ada timetable has been updated in this regard , &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
the PM ann@@ oted the second part of the W@@ ada &quot; plan to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization of the organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could give rise to Russia .
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented .
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added .
one of the criteria mentioned in the list stated that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities reported the reported results obtained by the W@@ ada @-@ approved investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly alleged dop@@ ings in Russian sport .
in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we have led the examination as our Anti @-@ D@@ oping system got a mistake .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ity words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission .
talking to the Russian sales centre of R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , S@@ mir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from the W@@ ada of implementing dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ Director @-@ General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .

this shared the company groups .
it may be a pure precau@@ tions , it could not be assumed by any health draw@@ backs , it was in the message .
as of now , only eggs are delivered to Al@@ di who have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ able anti @-@ lung cancer .
Al@@ di wants to establish clarity and transparency with its customers .

Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ cent has deployed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees .
now , as the company comm@@ itting off , problems that have previously been created by leaders who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or false practitioner @-@ - faster identified and addressed .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree point in experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company began to take ethics , values and staff commitment in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen was collap@@ sed by the En@@ ron @-@ sc@@ andal , said Fifth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it lasted until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in front of the use of technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service and strain the company with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors which have supported both start @-@ ups .
conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , where the whole capital was raised to $ 47 million .
gl@@ ist@@ ors secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments hardly come surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than ever before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high prices and interesting projects are only inser@@ ts .
the employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices heard , and that the work that you do is worth , then feel more committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , who uses both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t .
investors want to reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well if employees work and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third party promise , commitment and commitment to increase employee , it &apos;s no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employees engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of a company will not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and wor@@ ship@@ pers .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has seen himself too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you do not follow your employees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
and whom do not care about why should I ? &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly surveys now , was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem about G@@ lin@@ t is reported , so salvation .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ating employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , capable of organising multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customer , you will lose your company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ges
it is about 23 o &apos;clock to get a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot@@ ine parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team this is a mid@@ day break .
players who are ins@@ cribed to the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final examination before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; that &apos;s for guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday to Tuesday .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of the players and it has actually leng@@ th@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three tests of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will start to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ges postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school during Mor@@ as &apos;s six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 at the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he is supporting the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add to the busy itiner@@ aries of the players another point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , in view of the clear view of its fields from an adjacent parking area and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel that is already ch@@ opped with foot@@ notes , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ step which will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins @-@ Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set out there to record an exercise .
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ or from an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about this too .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ f@@ uses to fac@@ ten@@ re@@ inspec@@ tors of third parties and show their results under the original fee , then the world &apos;s largest online social @-@ network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News .
the company said in an opinion on his website that will commence it with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect any possible false reports and to send them to Fak@@ ten@@ audi@@ tor , which may display results of the Fak@@ ten@@ check out of the original article .
Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main points that was called F@@ ake @-@ News , many of whom believe that they also have influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were flooded in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan , after which social media networks are to be punished , if they do not manage to remove h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook was told in a separate explanation in German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts &apos; review .
&quot; besides the realization , which stories of fact @-@ audi@@ tors are challenged , people want more context to make profound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product man@@ ag@@ ger for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his messages , to decrease wrong news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ ole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ years .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ eping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg .
it is not the first book by Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expec@@ tedly emotional .
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b printing on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ time in the 1700 @-@ he years who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b expression ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always cried to smoke ; for at that time there was a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were even there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so connected with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little over @-@ rated &quot; ) it all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vic@@ tori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , to see the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the produced hy@@ ena heads at the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch .
he emigr@@ ated through the grounds and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke to Land@@ scape , and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees started taking care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which Ar@@ isto@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , whir@@ l@@ f it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps , who , who possessed : &quot; one could mean that country @-@ conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought the two families .
guys , let everything go down his gang ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive at the iter@@ ate base into the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who follows a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the farm up of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a turmoil that entered 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly City of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farm itself started in this area and I thought a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it director , who hidden the Dar@@ rell &apos;s family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mug@@ gler &apos; , represented by the s@@ mug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , who filled his own funeral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was du@@ g ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be almost once more of debt and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men sol@@ ves their debt crisis by married rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of hand@@ cu@@ dd@@ ling boys before , with a talent to advertise . &quot;
after the end of his engagement in the castle , Rhodes is looking for another unique scre@@ aming experience
he has taken a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about pus , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been res@@ igned by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned lives . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the promises of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf started the city of Bad Honnef on Friday its campaign to introduce a new brand name ( Rundschau with Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August , there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
or ? &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do this ( obviously ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; write them on their un@@ activated website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that many is better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we strongly believe that we as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizen to know the beauty and attractiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event it is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ reaching promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally they stand in the competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit rate can be awarded the city of Bad Honnef for its new roof brand and the campaign .
military reform in Turkey - Erdogan &apos;s fear of the army
each year in the beginning of August advises in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ings and subsidies in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine by the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the presidency of the government , the five vi@@ vi@@ re@@ mi@@ ers and the Minister of Defense , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the proceedings .
the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number of survivors .
the government is attracting the breeding in the military .
general homage to Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the Navy have been dropped .
since the failed Cou@@ p , State Erdogan has fired in 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdogan as a dra@@ wer of the coup .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved in the coup such as this week , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdogan had referred to the overthrow of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he give him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdogan really get the army under control ?
in late February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; Un@@ ab@@ gen in the military headquarters . &quot;
in the general system , there is concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , manifes@@ ts in the abolition of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for Sol@@ dat@@ s , wrote the newspaper .
the large corporations in the army and the security guards continues at any rate .
in the middle of July Erdogan sent by Dec@@ ree another 7@@ 3@@ 95 coup , including 2@@ 303 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdogan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier described as the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them on appeal to their role as a watch@@ man of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers , Erdogan drive targeted a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a name not so @-@ called officers who sought for the coup attempt to be searched for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
meets this , such a development could not be cold .
in any case , there is doubt in the alliance after the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato @-@ diplomats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , &quot; said President Donald Tr@@ ump , c@@ ites from the media .
he sees to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , more stringent regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a reason@@ ed working permit , and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do this by going the way the US will change the way to citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of chains and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , c@@ ites from the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to embark on a track for racing
over the past few months he had been argu@@ ing over the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les - now it &apos;s going to go quite fast .
even before the end of the year is expected to be on the mar@@ sh track , on which the tourist railway is running , built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the race against sh@@ utt@@ les long term , according to the Ministry of traffic , the Ministry is still to start on the track . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g further , the country is familiar to this especially for tourism , &quot; explained traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling of the track takes about 2.5 million euros .
from this sum , the country over@@ took 75 per cent .
the contract , based on whose basis the shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , is currently complete coordinated , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen train as the operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the driving plan , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway sector will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ shuttle on December 2017 will be ordered .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , it was tested in the course of a pilot plant , whether the route is used by sufficient many people in order to reproduce them in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the track is also very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it may not be even crazy , a new report comes across technological developments in the field of sex robots .
yes , really .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ated professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye @-@ color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pple and type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; people are worried about it , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ on in the publication of his new report .
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silic@@ on con@@ fer@@ ment that feels warm in touch - with aware human reactions , which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also adjust its robot according to its beliefs , &quot; and select everything from the eye @-@ color of the robot concerning the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of its f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots would possess the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a steppe @-@ woman progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed to robots with a silic@@ on skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt its robot to the properties which they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex robots with pre @-@ programmed people like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the Website of True Con@@ ion .
so you like what you like and they don &apos;t like what you like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tuning ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine traits , the references to rape , if one goes one step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : re@@ pri@@ eve ) Far@@ rah is , be@@ wil@@ ful one most .
on his website true true &apos; sp@@ y Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibration , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fairy or just a different sex toy .
their emergence and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will of course do not hold any sex robots , and while FR@@ R notice their increasing popularity , they remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture .
but what perme@@ ates from the edge @-@ zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive .
and many people are not strange or ins@@ ul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to them .
but there is a certain reasoning that these highly developed sex robots are occurring in a time when the rights of women are threatened in the world , in which there is a president in the White House who is pra@@ ising women sexually attacked .
the most horrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the wi@@ ped body and the out@@ to@@ ken eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( although with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their pe@@ ers want to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , to the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women .
they can not separate or just walk away from her companion .
they have no placement , or a background story , nothing that hin@@ ders on independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission .
other words : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human
it has become a binary of the Tr@@ ump era that pol@@ arized political sp@@ ouses that have split the U.S. voters to also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Ern@@ te@@ thank@@ fully there were newspapers with advice on how to handle the horror of the tick @-@ chosen relatives .
we all told us all to let our filter bl@@ isters leave .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ umps , to bring families together .
I chose this because my C@@ ousine , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family for a long time this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful enemy against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , with whom they had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page .
around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it also falls to me that this will bring significant risks to me .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the un@@ iting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and &quot; Tr@@ ump , &quot; we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ty possibility that no more will be b@@ illed to us for one day .
but there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing , &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear as a term of reasonable price compared to its standards .
I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ic version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car model , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked at ) - which both occur when compared to Tr@@ ump in effect of a very mild criminal off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only must be mentally healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel of Central Park , the largest of the car@@ n@@ ells of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals are turning to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conve@@ ying this in surprising ways .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines will become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themes @-@ pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London .
however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go to it and have all a great time .
if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full scores , but fortunately no one had asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale ranging from one to five stars during this week before I could go through my credit card .
at the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tips - this to buy something about the counter .
this leads not only to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required .
the poor wife in the department store was exc@@ usable , while I felt tired the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit the second time .
he was transferred to the hospital in the last year because of the treatment of s@@ lei@@ ghs to the hospital , which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to an appeal for an appeal to prosec@@ ut@@ ors to an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ en@@ kamp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tor@@ ia .
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he kept his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der that hidden himself in the c@@ ab .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year imprisonment of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , from which they say they are too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national law prosec@@ utor said that they will be reck@@ oned at the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold found a strange egg
the last of the Blum@@ berger schools were the premiere of the premiere of F@@ itt@@ en@@ hofen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen to leave during the holiday and in subsequent schools .
three of the aband@@ on@@ ment will go to high school in the future , four to the real school .
school@@ master Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ hofen .
as a symbol of school dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 students of the four classes elected under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and reg@@ ine , a young eagle which grows in the chicken yard , but then be released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this led the m@@ lower sh@@ ar a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it out of its chicken .
instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out .
but the hope to make of it a chicken , sm@@ ashed , the eagle scre@@ ened up on a high mountain its wings and de@@ ple@@ aded .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken .
the exec@@ utes danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cy@@ linders were wearing to the bet .
the eagle stand for the integration , said Schul@@ tz@@ y Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
you wish every four @-@ ring u@@ gl@@ ler that he feels accepted in his new school .
it followed acceptance to colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who jumps again and again at under@@ wear and the parents representatives .
the kitchen @-@ time was over now , explained Cl@@ ass@@ instructor Sophia Schu@@ macher .
she leave her students after two years of lessons only very odd , because it had been a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ kl@@ u@@ gl@@ ers .
at the end , all students end a song of summer@@ time and holiday @-@ time .
in doing so , the children broke great joy with the children .
for the new academic year eight first u@@ gl@@ yp@@ s are already registered .

two Bulg@@ arians were de@@ tained in Greece for illegal Camp@@ s in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television , with .
on the morning of 1 August in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police a group of illeg@@ ally inhabited people , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an examination is currently running .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free movement and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not intended for this purpose .

software update for diesel vehicles : what those who want to know now
how exactly does the software update be held ?
need a diesel driver to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
at the Diesel @-@ Summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates are offered for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they should improve the de@@ gas behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emissions classes 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe are estim@@ ations :
is the new promotion binding ?
no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional .
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
its retro@@ fit has arranged the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
the makers have announced a breeding implementation in the coming months , but no exact date is mentioned .
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
if any case is due in case of inspection , this will be done in the context .
how long should the retro@@ fit all over ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
the hing@@ es on the commitment of the manufacturer as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should this update be ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming might be to get an appointment .
what do motor@@ ists do , who will not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE is waiting for wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would be re@@ trac@@ ed , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in .
is now threatened a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas there have so far been no valu@@ ables for older diesel .
the ACE ga@@ thers , with a sale still to wait .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - out of protest .

the Le@@ ar series with progressive TV @-@ series announced today Le@@ ar already announced to rel@@ inqu@@ ish participation in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them the means - and the bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city li@@ vable
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes in R@@ ente next year .
the place is already written - suitable applicants are rare .
for 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun as he has taught in the press meeting .
he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it aston@@ ished him that so far no application will have the application profile .
the city looks for the next time an architect or civil engineer .
so should - taking into account the regular termin@@ ations of notice - still enough time for a review .
since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administration &apos;s administration as a sub @-@ ordin@@ ates authority , the applicant must show corresponding agreements .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
would it not be able to fill this out more , the citizens would have to continue for advice up to Off@@ enburg .
but that &apos;s close to the city and it himself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working environment as well as good mood between authority and citizens .
in office more than 30 years in office have accumulated a number of important projects to look back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the building office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ als and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen@@ park area approximately are taken .
the kin@@ ship bridge between Boll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject .
the latter is going to beat around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; says W@@ acker .
&quot; all in all wait great tasks to my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
gest@@ alt is present for a city @-@ tree @-@ master big room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gardening can react to plenty of flexibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces are often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what it fits , &quot; if new buildings are approved , stresses the cra@@ fting urban master .
in any case , the cit@@ y@@ master has a high responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a farmer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything is going on over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in attendance and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( High @-@ building ) has been with Manfred Schön@@ er for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Tief@@ bau ) for 15 years already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even though his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working environment , but also for the further development of the city .
those who want to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker should be a diploma from a diploma or Bachelor &apos;s degree for information of the city of Has@@ lach and have good expertise in the fields of civil and construction law .
the municipal office are under construction and low @-@ construction , construction planning , under@@ scoring operations , administration of the urban property , urban environment with construction and municipal garden building , as well as sub@@ contractors , including refurb@@ ishment protection .
bicycle on lines thrown off : south @-@ tram line closed
according to the police , the uni@@ denti@@ fied perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so severely damaged , that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for after dinner .
near the scene were witnesses of a pink rolling Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike driver had been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ is rich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator or the perpetrators brought itself into great danger and also threatens the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the lo@@ k and the system , as well as the delay and the cost of rail transport you could also add P@@ ön@@ als of rail customers to the perpetrators .
overall , be out of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; said the speaker .
the damages were repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ side route could be led without disabilities .
barely ten person@@ enz@@ ü@@ ge were Friday morning , two of them considered the correspondence .
Gü@@ ter@@ ades fell not , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres above the cable .
the ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , milk products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel )
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare .
but a new study claimed the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300@@ ,000 affects ga@@ stri@@ c , recur@@ rent diar@@ rho@@ ea , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected usually fall to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzüberein@@ kommen that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han are contributing to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food , do not enter the body .
cells that have been able to extingu@@ ish inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues .
when the equilibrium too far into the direction of inflammation tends to result from it a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
in experiments were determined that a type of tolerance conve@@ ying immune cell on mice occurs that carry out a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium uses tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of proteins &apos;s components - to em@@ ulate the image of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacter@@ ias - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
it suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition suggests , less inflammatory bo@@ wel , if the same system is also wir@@ elessly .
the Post@@ doc@@ torate in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explored a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance when they found out that a group of study ar@@ ouses had such cells , but another group of the same tribe who was separated from them .
they suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bial of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , who normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the D@@ är@@ me of the mice were detected DNA sequ@@ en@@ tes and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them mis@@ ses on mice .
mice were raised in a mortal environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria committed to the immune system , the researchers can grow L. reu@@ ter@@ i in an fluid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
as the active component from the liquid was pur@@ ged , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food processing , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ ous were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us are protecting L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal markets .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells ste@@ amed inflammation towards the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ous values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic committed a &quot; genius &quot;
at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia .
the 40 million Po@@ unds signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pres@@ e@@ ason game , before the UEF@@ A Cup Cup on Tuesday starts , and draw attention in the semi @-@ roll as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to Beli@@ eben .
however , MAT@@ IC had been excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and only got 45 minutes to do M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; we will help him be ready later than later . &quot;
besides M@@ atic rigid also Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho its start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was still three further newcom@@ ers , but he insisted that the Club has already done a &quot; fantastic job , &quot; three of his four priority qualifications .
&quot; three of four to get , thank you for the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happier if they were four of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar coal was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole was a stamina test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new low@@ n@@ ment for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem
as the wind is about , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , the Social @-@ Democratic Prime Minister said before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin .
just no stor@@ fire from the party central , merely no head@@ wind out of the covenant - the most important desire of the campaign fighters .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt and Willy Brandt are monitoring the events in the SPD member state capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described by a head@@ wind .
there were pl@@ ung@@ es .
and one after another .
the Bund @-@ CD@@ U sees after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Green .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fra@@ gment of a green @-@ president has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the landing @-@ election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ president Michael Kellner has asked the ab@@ ir@@ ate Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Green @-@ MEP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ers to return their mandate .
the crossing to the CD@@ U means a clear del@@ usion of the elec@@ torate .
El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate &quot; said the Federal Bureau and Elec@@ tions of the Gre@@ ens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; si@@ ghs an SPD @-@ campaign fighters than on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ serves the party central . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , is standing after the over@@ flow of green MEP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CD@@ U without its own governmental majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expec@@ tedly elu@@ sive defeat at the Saarland election in March .
one blue eye , more not , re@@ ass@@ uring himself the comrades @-@ time .
according to the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , everything will be different .
this was then also much worse - and it was notic@@ e@@ ably worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute @-@ headed the party .
lab@@ orious back the comrades in the weeks after that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 Summit came from Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with him the next row came .
Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member state , lost its Nim@@ bus at that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned .
and because he did so much wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW Ab@@ gas@@ a and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures came to be added .
nevertheless , or perhaps right now , Wei@@ l tried to put more strongly in the federal acc@@ ents over the last few weeks .
the aim of the former mayor of Hannover , his power in Berlin , also was not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .
they left him because they were promised by Wei@@ l a stabil@@ isation of the party .
now the exact opposite could arise .
incidentally , Wei@@ l hits the party @-@ internal we@@ ars of the Green Party in essence no fault .
and Schulz was not at all .
sometimes , the comrades try to close their own ranks .
their anger refers to the Gre@@ ens , and here mainly to the ab@@ ir@@ ate parliament@@ arians T@@ jack@@ ets .
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , like Mrs T@@ jack@@ ets her own career options on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag faction , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected as a direct candidate , but on the state list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , so the Euro MPs will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD Bundestag faction , laments a &quot; un@@ democratic man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Sax@@ on SPD as a leader in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career thinking of a future CD@@ U Euro MPs press the electoral result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clear the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there has been more or it has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suppor@@ ter of Ort@@ ner III
who wants to be hidden in the years will be able to get support from the country soon .
he informed mayor of Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg town development on Wednesday in delicate .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler was once again a review of the previous events .
since 1991 it has been in sensitive areas of refurb@@ ishment .
back then , in the San@@ itation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg has yet taken over two thirds of the funding total .
the grant was still at 60 percent in the refurb@@ ishment region II from 2005 to 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to encourage the interior design , and not only new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4th we received the information from the Govern@@ mental Presidency and received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total amount of EUR 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euro from the country , the rest of the church received .
how is a rehabilitation area now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role , whether in the planned sphere ever interest , to san@@ ship .
if necessary , the borders of the territory could also be postponed .
the jet@@ ty on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Kr@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Stadt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the boxes would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of domestic cities , improving residential and working conditions and maintaining the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is to be performed per property .
the re@@ organisation would finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
the authorization period for funding exp@@ ires since 1 January 2017 or 30 April 20@@ 26 .
even until September this year , however , this would only once be carried out the inventory , as part of those who want to fill out a questionnaire for filling in the re@@ organisation area .
in November or December , the rules of the statutes is to be made possible , so that in the coming year the refurb@@ ishment can be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann said that each Comm@@ une should carry out the predicted previous investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a question to evaluate and decide the city &apos;s urban abnorm@@ alities and to decide when re@@ inst@@ ated and to what extent .
I will also be registered for the particular plot of land in the basic book .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after hearing and get a picture of the situation she spoke .
Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be question@@ n@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property panel , in which it is among other things about the building condition and the refurb@@ ishment views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can get information about size , division and residents of a living room . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to fill only if in the building business areas are operated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is noted that Got@@ zel pointed out that a fulfilling questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , new measures are not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphasized that the distribution of funding depends on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wind and ration@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - who first comes , gr@@ ind first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can make no funding for later &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a reconstruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get in house and car with a hand@@ ler movement
a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a microphone , so that he can open his door@@ step , enter his office and even can start his car with a hand movement .
Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he has joined together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory board of aes@@ thes@@ i@@ thes@@ ists at the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to make sure the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra fee of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House will cost tax@@ payers thousands of
the decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to an event that highlights American production last month , costs tax@@ payers to the particulars which were left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board was the heart of the event on 17 July at the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift truck from Mississippi .
the White House requested the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary Order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ters in the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the deputy commander of aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 am on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock in the morning and remained so long until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .
the note adds that when departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second crew for the back flight would be needed .
the original flight was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
in the records available from the T@@ IME provided , it wasn &apos;t clear whether ultimately a second flight was required .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal government officials for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 was asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question that we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Act and we were informed about it that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; said the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to the reform of the reform reform , which was in the Senate in the Senate , and he trained the efforts towards con@@ tainment of government regulations .
the use of the plane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is , from politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for travel .
but their use only for a photo OP is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February in February , when the Presidential aircraft was taken in front of the background of his first campaign appearances in Melbourne , Florida , taxi service , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the area around Washington and in South La@@ wn , to set the US President in the White House with precise cuts .
when Tr@@ ump in early July was at the G20 meeting in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led 58 training land@@ ings at the White House 58 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was dealt with in the training needs of the airplane for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Heli@@ kop@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential sions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps that were presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget fees for the Presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ ress of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D replacement for the v@@ H @-@ 3D however is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of the unit register the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argue that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ payers to set tax@@ payers are on the basis of the estimates for revenues , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an AND study from the year 2015 , the revenues for DO@@ D will not contain the recruitment costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Sean Sp@@ readsheet , the use of helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things this week , which are produced in America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said spam . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphas@@ ise that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his round about the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of fire cars .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media of his own fleet of company products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

despite his five games still flaw@@ less record , the leader in the Second World Cup has received the sense of reality .
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .
especially at the back positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V take care of the imports from the far north .
&quot; their insulation and Finn@@ s can even refer to the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre Go@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ irs and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas Bj@@ ør@@ hus ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is always difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there you also need a good serving luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ kus@@ z again could put back into the team again .
it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was in January 2016 the number one of the j@@ uni@@ ors world rankings , do not fill someone from the trainer by Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
really happy Donald Tr@@ ump is not when he put his signature by the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his pants , the law en@@ acted , &quot; the Congress has packed a few &quot; constitutional provisions . &quot;
also the reaction from Moscow was so sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US initiative .
after all , the draft looks forward to pun@@ ish European companies who help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU .
since then , investors of the Local O@@ MV are co @-@ financed with other European firms the construction of Russian Eastern Europe @-@ Pacific Nord Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is tremendous .
nevertheless it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring sanctions even by executive order to life .
twelve weapons are available to him for election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has viewed which the group could rep@@ el and which could actually do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role backwards : the town provides 46 kitchen@@ ware .
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a correlation with the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gartens , the clock is revers@@ ed .
in September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban centre of children ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy leader in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth aid &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked continues by house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh @-@ cooked cool@@ ed .
the city operates in the Krem@@ lin area 46 children &apos;s day care centres , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
in the past Kit@@ a@@ year there were 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , the 45 Wo@@ ests will be taken care of , in the K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the offer is also available in 35 @-@ hour care if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
46 part@@ ements from 1 September kitchen service : you heat the angel@@ ic foods , supplement them at salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the food out , clean up , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ch@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decide about the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier to implement these concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this is why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot;
the direct connection of the chef &apos;s power may be useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has beside the quality improvement of the kitchen power as well as the charm that it has placed itself in the cost @-@ comparison between the origin@@ als and foreign loans for the city as the economic most economical , it is said of the press desk .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ hired .
&quot; but these hours fall at about 750 people in the gu@@ ardi@@ ans area not so strongly in weight , &quot; Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can be only representative when all members of society , including the women , play a role , said the boss of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting head of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are united at the R@@ ats@@ sel@@ ections in the provinces . three women are campa@@ igning for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement .

GM@@ B concerns over investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to make a trade union with managers of the Bis@@ cu@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie for the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company l@@ ull over the future of investments at T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work in the plant that puts next to other products of Hob@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested over 5 million pounds over the last few years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the branch of the company GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies plans , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here , and the workers have a strong focus on the local community and wholesale Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high levels of unemployment and social de@@ priv@@ ation .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of living and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently recommends a thri@@ ving production volume in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch of T@@ oll@@ cros@@ sover has just received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union officials .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ cros@@ sover , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we discussed with the employees that we work like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain business climate , our business continuously checked and this applies to all our business units and locations - to be competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognize the legacy of rab@@ ies as a production place whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ tedly . should our factory courses change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the P@@ SG Barcelona warned three years ago in front of Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Germain is not letting go down in its persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after leaving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release his free@@ wheel cl@@ amp , but have warned Barcelona three years before the world volume ?
the sensational approach has been ki@@ cked out in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned last season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United .
after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and to the highest paid professional athlete of the world . P@@ SG offers wages of over 500,000 GB@@ P per week .
Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way to the outside , although a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans show that the Club always has given his best to take care of him since its arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the P@@ SG @-@ president in front of this view ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players in P@@ SG .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried , because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line with the Spanish Association earlier this summer interest in the P@@ SG @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
P@@ SG made clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar .

an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese seeks the police witness .
because he came across a car on his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to ev@@ ade and tou@@ ted the leit@@ motif .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um was travelling with his VW at 19.@@ 55 p.m. at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au coming to Le@@ ese in the direction of Le@@ ese .
in the area of the center of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car met him on his lanes , so that he had to go to the right .
tou@@ chi@@ pped the tour @-@ drivers the Leit@@ plan@@ ke .
on the car appeared non@@ violence .
the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ hau@@ led a truck and continued his ride without taking care of the traffic accident .
it may be good for indications of accident that the Mer@@ ce@@ des@@ ist had not noticed the accident at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police now ask witnesses of the for@@ f@@ le as well as the driver of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ riculum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get in touch with the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ Report ent@@ last@@ et Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of abuse of the Pope George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the abuse sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen continued for discussions .
Christian Weis@@ mann , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication in front of the German press Agency , he expects from the former Rain@@ sburger Bishop and today Car@@ dinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed pop@@ e Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve to serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would like to express their profound regret on their own om@@ is@@ sions or their back then false assessment of events .
the Vatican newsletter &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen is measured with &quot; two levels . &quot;
regarding the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it must be punished by &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; handle , however the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; thus the author Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committees .
&quot; the habit to design@@ ate the ca@@ tho@@ lic church as a source of all evil , is already part of the everyday experience and preparing the public opinion that is for normal &quot; wrote Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis supposed to be in an interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would love to go on the church and that &apos;s a found fres@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were a quite normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be with s@@ assy children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abnorm@@ alities , often Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often emerged .
completely wron@@ g@@ ly , says author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who dealt with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg with the clarification of the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Rain@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high pl@@ ou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , it is defined that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also be violent .
nevertheless , contrary to numerous other alleg@@ ations , the fact that many victims estimates the general humanity from R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even link positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview Hes@@ emann , why the final report for the abuse sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion are relie@@ ved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pre@@ incidents of Viol@@ ation Practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a lift , many students stand forth his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the other he appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist that was able to take the o@@ cher &apos;s hand , if a domain was musically set no top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his Bi@@ ograph ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : when one turns into the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it .
he is particularly dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly spoken by any suspi@@ cion or fellow @-@ words in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside his sphere of efficiency .
you can blame him if you &apos;re going too late or not take the first hint seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ar school in which he worked , was perceived from virtually all respon@@ dents as - as literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
thus the wide majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents a very excellent reference , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who cat@@ ered the guys with cakes , biscu@@ its , and bondage , and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to tan@@ tr@@ ys .
that he did not only cast with chairs and cast the key@@ hole on the ground but also ear @-@ ears , and too distr@@ acted guys went to the hair or ears , he even has been given years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for this .
to his volunteers must be said , however , that such educ@@ ators in the question@@ able time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , at parents like with teachers .
do you also know such re@@ breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state school .
compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool is that of course dre@@ dging .
you wonder if it is not to do with his famili@@ arity and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media has just rus@@ hed to him .
on the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood it , still are eager to work .
but the truth is : the report is relie@@ ved Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media in connection with the report , a lot was reported on the topic of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also put any dis@@ sertation or compassion in terms of sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a du@@ pe for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse has been and is , however , that most of the victims are not silent .
if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ator .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulate it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he would have had timely findings and would have been able to stop the respective perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that ... Bu@@ zz@@ ling a ha@@ unting or more clear , or more likely to be opened , compared with their parents , inter @-@ nat@@ s@@ guides , teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students affected in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of every fellow @-@ knowing .
it cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad .
therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these dis@@ war@@ dly crimes , as it was unfortunately in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former cathedral @-@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is dis@@ car@@ ded in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and dec@@ eived was a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly what is an abuse of the report .
namely , it is kept clean : between the pr@@ enti@@ ment and the grammar school of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , we say again , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report has been dealt with in the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral manager .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases where l@@ ad were f@@ aded and mal@@ igned and mal@@ toler@@ able , were all on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out .
but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , for he got the boy only to face when they were already on the school @-@ school @-@ school @-@ school .
on the one hand , as the most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; pr@@ enti@@ ce &quot; tab@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was only happy to escape it and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavenly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different in the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ar school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there is discipline that has been discipline , but there is no profound violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims estimates the general humanity from R. , and therefore in many cases , despite violence even link positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so most still remains the accus@@ ation to be looked at .
but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the processes at a school where he had not worked and responsible , ( such a witness ) did not want to hear , and then again until 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently pursued the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral @-@ school school , even re@@ produces the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out to that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the test will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
already in light of the danger of negative media outlets , he recommended urgent inv@@ ading .
this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test of testing was forbidden in Bavaria too .
before that they did take place in a legal gray area , as each of us probably knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate correctly , where those affected are perhaps excessive or dram@@ ati@@ sed , and where really the permitted border had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say he had always looked at .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .
Für@@ stin Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis maintained that yes , it is unfair to apply the educational standard to the then time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger to evaluate the past moral standards .
the princess was already right .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was ab@@ omin@@ able and also not for what was st@@ acked in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence against in@@ culp@@ able te@@ ab@@ els , that goes far beyond that time usual .
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am glad that it is finally working .
but at the same time I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , thus ear@@ ns and to pull to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
as a physical punishment then it was forbidden to strictly adhere to it .
which image from his rainy season has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &apos; ?
did the topic test ? also the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , because the cathedral @-@ sp@@ at@@ zen also played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not understand that he took a strict regim@@ ent there .
but that also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the unilater@@ ally un@@ condition@@ ned discipline , it would probably have been possible for him to form an institution of World tran@@ g up to the true Cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which entered the tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with biscu@@ its and bondage alone , you do not even make a big singer and stand before every success , just in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of people do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with their book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger over and over and over again a wonderful , hum@@ orous , infl@@ atable , deep @-@ believing and heart @-@ good people , from which one could not imagine that he could only di@@ stract one fly .
I regularly receive how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still get in touch with him today , 23 years after his embar@@ king , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who have not for@@ given him today that he was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are today grateful to him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely dis@@ respect to which she still watch and honor them .
and please , once again clear : everything you re@@ pro@@ ach are gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were at the time of the day .
we can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al scap@@ e@@ goat .
there is the evil intention behind it which is not so obvious .
because the report that was just published , relie@@ ves him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the rise of people , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally in peace ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
