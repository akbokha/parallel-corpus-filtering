<seg id="3">A greeting-chapel, where now for the S-Bahn grid.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small-denser cultivating the invigorous reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">That knows everyone who had to get rid of themselves, because the car-Navi instead of a bypassing way showed a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas of the State Government, are far from current - yet very conclusive.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a splattered canvas that one cannot recognise as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big coverage map are more detailed map for cities and communities, so-called urine sheets, which works.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were developed according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and jump from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army forces occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Koalithic war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course to military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops eventually moved up with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was today's neighbours that created the idea of a region-covered Bayern.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph led the project to advance the" "" "topographical Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bayerische Audit Committee." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional Journal of Munich dates back to 1856 and is available as any other website from the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is most impressive at the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is underdling that appears in the card of 1856 still relatively isolated.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was convened 21 years after the map, so 1877, as a Munich's district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Untersendé focus on 1856 along the present Plinganserstrasse which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbers with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered copies of the so-called "Urge" from which the property tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots remain there today no farmers more - but a gardener of the complex "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, since 1810 showroom of the October Revolution, was in fact a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Urpositional Journal, one reads in the area of today's district au-Haidhausen not only the road name "at the guest" or from the height "On the air," but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, there are once people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "there was 1858 / 59 the Münchner circle of Ireland" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden employed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is connected to King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive in his time and ended for example the accusation of so called Irish." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the staff to apply violence against the inmates, "says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Haidhausen, who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients had been first square, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sometime these capacity no longer ranged - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East is located there since 2006, one of Germany's biggest Psychiatriums in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="40">On the area of former Auer Anstalt can now be meeting young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and changed it into a youth-house with training.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses dating back to the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" - in architectural counsel on the origins of the Irrenanstalt, had been destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienbad was listed at 1856 als' main square, "the Kauffinger was named" Kaufinger alley. "</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies were torn in December 1944, many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big stayed until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages had once been at the Marienhof, where these days will work and take place on 5 April 2017 by the spade for the second S-Bahn.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider aerators, the old Munich card can be compared with the air image of today - and replenish the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "the national union to promote colored" "" "colored" "" "has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri, on the basis of discriminatory politics and racist attacks of the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the state of Missouri are to take special attention until 28. August 2017, visitors and Missourans to leave particular attention through the state, since a series of fragmentors-based incidents occur in recent times throughout the country and can be noted down here," says it in the opinion of the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win discrimination, as well as the prosecution bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to release the travel warning, said the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights to happen." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They will hold off because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group reported incidents like racist vertices against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after having no gasoline anymore and taken away by the police for Missouri, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also pointed to a recent published report by the Office of the Secretary-General of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be 75 per cent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and about their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be prepared if they bring cheating money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri awarded 100 Hasscrimes in 2015, according to the latest numbers from the Hassary-reporting program of FBI, which proposes the state in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri Law, which would make it harder to shorten a company due to housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to the American Civil War Union (ACLU) Destinations for Texas and Arizona, following the states of immigration laws passed, local criminal enforcement authorities had to commit to restraint people because of immigration violations.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times the measure have been implemented as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Extinction project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisherman-pasture fence-project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag, Peter White and Kordula Kovac have found a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">At the Victimelhof of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fisherman CDU's association with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave us insights into his farm, in which he cultivated 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengaeste.</seg>
<seg id="72">The "Black-aldmilk" is for him the alternate filling away for the milk of its cows, so piwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste it comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">As he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Fischbach, he described the graviar project as "elementary."</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not gain leverage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green spaces for a lot of work, much should be edited with the motorsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the terms and conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the elteral operation and managed to run this without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if it does not lead to bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the significance of the settlement project and is happy to promote leader." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the expense of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers should be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "" "" "we hope so that the forestation of the areas could be drawn up still quite a while." ""</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their business," "" "stressed the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013 the total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The conservation area amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of its leader was promoted, a quarter carried the village of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers love 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac emphasised:" "" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farming." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiss stood firm:" "" "here are the best food produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The agricultural-law firm (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state promotion of pasture-goons.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the revelation of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR has been established.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "furthermore, the fence may not be slippery. (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by forestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">For the fisherman's Christmas project, 2018 currently runs the motion of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of Zaun.</seg>
<seg id="96">The conservation area is 35 hectares, the calulated cost lie at more than 112 000 Euro.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now, the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime transfer is when they begin to attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic txt in a heated argument with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller does not attack the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitters would have shout him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he attacked their significance, and in particular importance that it was attributed to it, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, has been added to its basis.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta shoots: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to that was later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your exhausted, your poor, / your affliction the masses, who craving for, free to breathe, / the miserable of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "elende waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller got dedicated not to literary critic - he clearly made that these people are not welcome in Trumption USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who set themselves up to place their words after their death on the base - knew very well that she has accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicanism, showing them in an abused classical imaging representation the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this significance: in their poem, the feminine figure is no more abstract, she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just like Lazarus, the importance of the statue changed, people wanted to change it for a long time from the right wing.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is no one-charge but rather an early Neocon who bring the American flame to the converted world: "Lady Liberty is proceeding.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not intended to enlighten the path to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely and a question of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people have been seen after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue said to them the words of hope and of the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective, which Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch should not enlighten the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Your captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were motivated.</seg>

<seg id="144">The Commonwealth of silver Medal, who will compete in their fifth world Championships at the 400-m hurdles, says that it is "incredible" that 16 jackets are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which was reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The muir-runners Muir leads on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>

<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics concerning Facebook: delve not a public office if you cannot wear the inserts of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans also loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers put him because of everything, from internal policy to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He piped at the critiques, safe.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silenced its critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783 Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid we are led like the sheep to the slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland, governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil War did not defendant it from the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the heads of the governors left the lawsuit as frivol, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican Governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest-ranking approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heater.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very fond of using Facebook as the primary means to join with his voters and to debate his haired head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governors of the governors - which is a public forum, which is officially referred to as officially and by employees that are paid with public tax dollars, needless and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson defended the actions of the governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of sunglasses or spammers or hassers people who are online the whip vibrate.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>

<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical models and to burn or to burn protesters and to silence them.</seg>

<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, which were launched in 2011 by UEFA in 2011, means that PSG must show sometime that the transfer of Neymar was financed without large losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid €222 million (262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make the money loose so that Neymar writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich mistress of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may apply to players a lot of money to acquire players, but they must be controlled with legitimate objection sources, which allow them to allow the break-point in their on the football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs that had taken tremendous debts in their quest for success, effectively defraud and rised to ruin, if banks or owners returned their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP took the attention to the debts of the clubs for the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The amendment meant that the business model, the Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invest heavily to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses from EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini was fallen by the presidency in Belgnade, its UEFA successor will continue to divulge Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly, FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Trafalso, who is responsible at UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoices over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a 5-year contract, so that the resolution can be transferred for the next five years to the amount of 44.4 million euros in the year.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has met the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a penalty of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are eligible for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual normal 25 player.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outwave their financial perspectives by connecting their revenues by companies who are connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could be sponsoring the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">Exactly that happened 2014, when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was collected by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It has been reported that a part of the PSG payments to Gymar on payments of the Organs Committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar Cup ambassadors will be able to find and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could easily figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to notice any attempt to bypass the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG about Neymars Transfer, sagging on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsorship Deals, merchandising and tricotics.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after the signature of at least 30 percent is rising.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers to see and she tried to avoid Neymars drich by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financing doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal Manager of Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La League against a State that financed an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the landlady, and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football for the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="1156">"once a country has an association, everything is possible.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, was taken in 2014 by a big house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrasse - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne has not packed their pockets and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this flat in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I have fallen in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add joying storage space and a mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my request, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose they assigned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, to make use of 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home which was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on each other, allowing the architectural challenge to create a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative in order to release the assignment.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were skipped each other without having to decorate them." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It's not just about building a simple platform, but to create the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or down. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This order allows it to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine a classic copper light of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Vocal finishes, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination exposing the style to the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a quick corridor is mirrored to make it longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance we provide carpeted units place for all seating and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of Ingenieurkunst went in," explains Erfan of the reinforced, frightened MDF door.</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is equivocally important, so if you push the door highly, very easy it leads." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne offers extra 16 m ², one additional bedroom and added layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property is appreciated," Erfan says.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and create a calculation based on bottom size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they managed to enlarge the surface area and at the same time use high-quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself in the electrical sockets of the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they are not playing with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of somewhat standard into something very astonishing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, as Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after her Italian family founded the dynasty, in an examination of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developers Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and its assets are to be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp examination of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna the brothers have collected 38 real estate assets worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family purchased a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood, since 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the family of Westco founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retailers.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with its late father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" was described in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's character and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A judicial system states that colin property retains the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the worth of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul as a problem.</seg>

<seg id="1367">On Friday past Friday, the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers also fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims to be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but casts Paul before, to manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early affidavit that was filed by Colin, he says he hope to bring about the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage is written that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The cost increases in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both sides of the law firm.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacy from the late 1950-0s and bought a shop in Brunswick's early 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, in which Colin the first Jeansing of the family opened.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco, when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says she died and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their children.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land on trial," she wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis group of companies, whereby Colin claims that Mark on abandonment of the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million were paid.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff of the White House, at his first working day, he welcomed a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad information that got into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Ways diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tump Trump by monitoring its media.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair coverage of jobs, which were to convince," the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico.</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that" "" "the Key to hold Trumps Twitter habit in control, according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that his personal media intake includes a constant praise price." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps is ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fighters-gators know something we do not know others - that Trumps Tweets had even more fathic without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets, the Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees have succeeded in holding it away from him for several times, then their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has consistently prevent it that Trump controversy calls out.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a white house, which sets off from competing parties, always try to move their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - quite busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisors to conduct the President for strategic reasons without questionable information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example which was described by reporters Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, above all such with damaged leaks and that he tends to figure out where these originate.</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president of malicious a printed copy of an article of Gotnews.com, the site of the Internet provocation in Katie Walsh, "the source behind a pile to be of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was banished due to hares from Twitter or that he did not have any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and revoke it.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump reading the article and started to ask employees about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldmakers added that the then staff member Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly attempts to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his consultants still seek influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair about US President Donald Trump, he has to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury for a report on a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">In recent weeks the panel was recorded in recent weeks, the "Wall Street Journal" wrote on appeal to the cause of familiar persons.</seg>

<seg id="1486">The investigates will be a number of men who acted in the election campaign as advisor of the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps, private and corporate surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Scottish Trump has moved into the center and asked the accusation, whether the President prevented the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Lawys is to check this evidence in possible waste, and to decide whether charges are to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Yyys are therefore also called Prosecution.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on from the Public Prosecutor to invite people for engaging under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN channels have already been issued pre-invitations, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">Additionally, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. there were also Trumps consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Right-wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the installation show that Mueller should not let go down in his work and that he should be necessary to act fast.</seg>

<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the replacement of the body at the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray Russia's affair as a campaign of his political opponents.</seg>

<seg id="1520">The shared the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar- and Seon Research with Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The more than one trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometers major piston driving now to the north and will need two, three years until he melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it has been one of the largest ice giant that the researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">To what extent climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg, is still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for around 30 years, writes the US-Research Centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a factsi background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken piston was so far a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>

<seg id="1531">North of this shot was the balance of wax and vomiting a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A full scrap is torn there, writes AWI scientist Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some reasons that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the leading edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Also, the ice-plate stand up under tension and can fall, if at a key set of slowdown.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg increases the sea level not because they float on the water and pushes ice as much water as it yields after the fuse itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of shame leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow far more quickly than before.</seg>

<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were available for the places this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers are employed as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG initiative and face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>

<seg id="1562">The goal is to cover not only short-term need for skilled workers but to counteract forward-proof of the application scarcity, it is called.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be based on the inside and outside, to indicate concrete measures for cross-climbers and include an figurative offensive, calling CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds already after a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has it with staff problems that you didn't know earlier.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is by a downright "contest of the public employer."</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees, the disease or age-related causes of service.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Highest time for action thus, so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>

<seg id="1756">But the nitrogen oxides, the diesel engines, are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities used Audi to bypass the emission regulations in Europe, and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>

<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly paper Riodoce is usually meeting in order to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change her routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what will feel safer: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were the target of an attack with granates, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponent, neutral, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporter, to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal tone.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug muggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the sidetslist of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest-break from the violence, and throughout the country the bodies of corpses are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to office in December 2012. 589 are following terms and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Under the latter, your editor and the inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His lack is felt deep though its presence is everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows its medium-finger with the word "Justice," depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, who show its smiling face with glasses or its typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although 2010 was established a Sonder-Federal Ministry in order to edit the cases of journalists, it initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee to protect journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders that are linked each year with drug-trade and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are only rarely challenged.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are barren and although the terrain is still available.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting of the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>

<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was forced by two men. he was shot out of his car, and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelvth river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzmans arrest last year and the delivery into the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest slaughter of the country, because rival factions are fighting here to fill a vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of ated, two-story mouse oleans for drugs, which are bigger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drugs trading routes in the United States has.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February the publication of an interview with Damascus Lopez, a leader of one of the rival filters in the war with Guzmans's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, guessed cares bought each copy of the issue once they have been delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was that Valdez does not force to compel the same story after the confiscation of another newspaper, which has published the same story to leave the country at its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killings is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues emulate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He had worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the howry problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to be hard-ahead investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"" "eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" "" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" "" "for their coverage in Latin America." ""</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He was voluntary to believe that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue life," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento on the last October.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take the task that you as a journalist drops - either that or you play the Dumas.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what did you do with so many things... why did you not say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, go there always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Well, she ask her: was his love for routine to ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also brought her to question her own assumptions on how to best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their canny and runways, to move drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Your own instincts trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">When it smells wrong, keep away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened."</seg>

<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the government government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a vitiary building in a mid-story building of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who are Governor themselves as trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It has been months since the Reporter has gone into the mountains, where the drug development are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the edition of this week, Riodoce has given three main stories.</seg>

<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite bar of drug traffickers and authorities.</seg>

<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the Reporter to write about previous incidents in this eatery, including one in which a son of "El Chapman" Guzman went to a military attack.</seg>

<seg id="1892">At a meeting with Governor of Sinaloa, on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pronounce journalists and make them change because they said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since then asked for her to be divided by the government, because she is worried that her anger has hurt their objectivity.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He met something that was missing from the surrounding rocks at the Platze, and decided to see more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>

<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished product is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you just flashing a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - Mona Lisa, the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this hernivores, although it is covered with armor and a changing tank, probably the meat-eating dinosaur has been threatened.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armoured dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used an tanking technology that is known as a counterpart, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to mix better in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of Nodosaurs made its headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild beast and known it Borealopelta with Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astounding preservation of the specimen allowed it to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of scales and armor on his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-attication, a widespread Defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-attiing is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points out that the dinosaurs hunted from enough pressure by meat-end dinosaurs, that the evolution favored the veiled of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use counter-attiture - think of deer, zebras and girdots - are much smaller and vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real struggle for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong beast-animal behaviour on a massive, strongly-armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs of predators have to have been the chalk time," said Brown.</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur is brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his consistent showing, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe the dinosaurs when he died, went into a river and went out into the sea where it sank to the sea to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preservative skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," said Brown.</seg>

<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was plank after death in the sea and was converted to mud.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Fierce accident on Thursday night on the A8: almost 30 cars are involved in a mass ambolonage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometric steel and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people have been wounded on the late Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first information provided by the police at 17.00 pm between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 cars, including the trucks, there are probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">On the exact number of recent publishers there were no information.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It is light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of bailout vehicles was at the accident scene.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was fully locked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of riding Munich a couple of ten kilometers long backstau formed.</seg>

<seg id="1982">The firebrigade notes the hallmarks of the vehicle's cars, who have now reckoned with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 p.m. there was a second accident on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Here it was a collision between a car, sporadic and a truck.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group testing "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened in his work and has just an ingenious thought.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: pufff.</seg>

<seg id="1991">Ticket-card control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn currently test the jobless ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm your phone that you have taken up your seat and thus value the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">There is currently a test run on two routes.</seg>

<seg id="1997">"" "it is expected to be available in many more remote races in Germany at the beginning of next year." "" "said S & D spokesperson." ""</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use, however, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already the most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">One must also have purchased it via the app of rail, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket sales.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "for the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works as follows: one gets up in the train, calling his ticket under" "" "My Tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">In the test customer a button for electronic devaluation appears.</seg>

<seg id="2006">If the train driver is in the vehicle control at square Y, he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">One can thus continue to sleep, continue to keep on silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customers, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"" "" "" "who relaxed without a ticket control through our train service, check out the DB Navigator software." ""</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the flow of personnel or otherwise a document that you have to indicate.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result are endless discussions between train guides and chassis, which leads to bad mood in the waste or large room and delays in control of one's tickets and takes over time to take care of other matters.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this is also based on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after having arrived in New York City, sitting in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a mail of someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street," "" "says it there." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Bewildered, because no one otherwise posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the manual @ TheePharoah was constantly saving on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo., killed, squad live.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He begged an image of Brownlebloly body that was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell with himself.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone in order to return to Tweet later in the evening about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people, crying, and by a man who claimed to be a shield who bore a sign: "Fergusons police have just killed my unarmed forces!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live Feed in which a policeman was faced with a group of protesters with a barbed dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, unsecured another policeman his rifle and cried, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell reminded of its statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt cheering frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock, she finished her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?" in cinema from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the viewpoint of the people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrel was with her daughter who bore a flower-dress and a suitable crown, after Ferguson, the two were a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I have taught you when black people must fight for what they believe?" "" "reminded me of what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I could not take her away" "", "said Ferrell later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You need to know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I have the good fortune to give her an experience where she personally experienced no eklatants, she is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">I have the feeling that I would give her a bad service to keep them away. "</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was transformed into a camp rather than activists waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began to embrace a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after the 9th August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food safety and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organically.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening-demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted only to document "what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came into mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of men, often by white - in a community which benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan explained recently in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, who have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field that is known for his activism around Todestrakt-Insassen.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement brought the project closer together, along with six other locals, followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browning.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaking with us. we talk," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because I will be represented." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is not about a Messiah, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - she proved to be the revealed participant of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">"" "as a result, documents of" "" "Whose Streets?" "" "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how they fell in love and marries their wife." ""</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like nude," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability during this work and the humanization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferris history repeated the role of black gay women in the broader black-lives-matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager, Martin in 2012 has shaped the film "Blackbig Matter" in social media, identify themselves as pregnant.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay men in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, sultry women must bear the main last of all. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to notice that" "" "the movement really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, they insist that" "" "this is not a affirmatively type of action," "" "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the movie." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who stirred up this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front line, because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman stands so much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel your energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">In the meantime, the news cameras have long gone from Ferguson, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of the blockages of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"" "it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that it calls their home:" "" "a mess." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless, they complain about a song and she feels bound to this memory, since she went into Ferguson three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to gain.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV-readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south bank of the pedestrian zone has been splitted from the first presentation in 2009 to the people of proponents and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" is the subject discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"" "while the one to say to the bit of the bit:" "" "this would be a dream" "" "(" "" "Nicole Schausten)" "" "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" "" "does not need a human being" "" "(Siggi Betzen) or simply plain:" "" "size waits!" "" "(Lars Scholz)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents rely on that a gallery will attract more customers into the city, of which also the rest of the shops take advantage, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precede.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmers market hall is available, in the 13 direct market entry.</seg>
<seg id="2096">The beginning of construction will be concluded.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and indeed there is room with possibility of sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying a weekly market hall for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always happy to be very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if a direct market in a market hall can be moved in the gallery, comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but that is likely to be very low in the new project." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's why shopping Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Clothing, shoes, dgerie- or supermarkets: I find that superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores here are empty - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Since this is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that we at least receive the market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is largely offered by the producer and is obendlessly clean.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, charging shops are located in a shopping center only of bigger companies, because the dorsal rents are often not viable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special stores there is almost no more and that which is still remaining, will then also disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fanals: "a mall with a Markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market hall during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost Bit gallery before, to expel all business from Bitburg? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And a shopping center that stands empty also no one needs.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer-market riding there are thanks to the insane many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">When the farmers market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost invisible - that are hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, aus Wangen-Tupola and Haarlem, that you were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst made a 35-year imprisonment of imprisonment, after having publicly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (A matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united their professional competence in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and a indicative disstudent, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted through the algorithms analysis of the DNA which could be extracted from Manning and look out of the 30 portraits, like anyone with these genomic data - the many ways of how they can be interpreted and created the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, who has spoken about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six violations of the esparrot Act, computer acts and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the prison its image was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a baskets, black-white selfishy, sitting in the creing clearly on a driver's seat and a platinous perl carries - with which it was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette blers and chewing gum, that extracts the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were given to unequal letters, which in the course of two years were exchanted letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"" "they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic" "" "Supplement Images" "", "which would foresee a future in which President Chelation Proceed judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally." ""</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was released, Manning release was asked for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep in opening the exhibition at the opening of the exhibition and Starkes, since Donald Trump introduces a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweet paths that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen from a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In one on the wall of the gallery, creing with their oversized signature, called "i" in its family name, is equipped with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis is sex, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandwich of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the involvement of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing, at least in biological aspects, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully bring about it is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories can also be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30" "" "stories" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece of the exhibition, which is stored in an own space is a page from the above mentioned Comic-Novelle.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-prediction in hand from the indiscipline barracks of the United States like King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they are speaking your speech, then they have won," says it.</seg>

<seg id="2155">That was also focused, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic Haplogins have been written with pencil.</seg>

<seg id="2184">The PM annoted the second part of the Wada "plan to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-replacement of RUSADA and recently published on the organization of the organization.</seg>

<seg id="2189">In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "we have led the examination as our Anti-Doping system got a mistake.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not function.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers were not grieving the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has been called for people from the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is on guard to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment, it enables companies to provide surveys, specious groups and demographic groups, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to handle the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools like Strava and FitBit for pursuing their health, but where is the FitBit for your company?" Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel at Glint for the three years.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, there is a heat-card of the company that indicates which units have most complaints and which managers have low consents results - so you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the head of the workplace culture you have to stay, so that you won't get the next Uber that has been involved in scandals, since then a former colleague has published a blog post, who described an environment of harassments, in those who have spoken, punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like Glint, this wish is for an overview of a lucrative business possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industries could have no more than $118.7 billion value according to the budgettechnical website let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect evil behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-case in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like Glint, Convergence enables tailor-made "Pul-" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which the employee can announce their bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the main business manager is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the judgment of public opinion has seized the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that his staff is badly treated or behaves unethically, it can experience precious consequences by consumer boycott, workers fluctuation and moan, said Fifth.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, convercent has deployed for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company committing off, problems that have previously been created by leaders who were sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or false practitioner-- faster identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree point in experience with employment," said Vitrano, who manages the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Company began to take ethics, values and staff commitment in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen was collapsed by the Enron-scandal, said Fifth.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it lasted until the" "" "Social Media came to their right" "", "that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"in front of the use of technology for monitoring the ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and strain the company with recurrent fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors which have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, where the whole capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glistors secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments hardly come surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more than ever before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high prices and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that you give your time a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that makes their voices heard, and that the work that you do is worth, then feel more committed to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent as well as Glint.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors want to reach Renditen when their portfolio companies run well. companies are running well if employees work and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third party promise, commitment and commitment to increase employee, it's no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employees engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of a company will not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and worshippers.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, the company has seen himself too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you do not follow your employees," "" "have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">And whom do not care about why should I? "</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly surveys now, was able to initiate action on the same day if a problem about Glint is reported, so salvation.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrating employees, it was able to reorganize several teams of decision-making and the quality of communication, capable of organising multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.</seg>

<seg id="2273">The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, in view of the clear view of its fields from an adjacent parking area and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel that is already chopped with footnotes, which will be a protective network behind a doorstep which will not be an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Bruins-Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admits that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"we will use our security," said Mora.</seg>
<seg id="2276">"this is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people rent a room there and then set out there to record an exercise.</seg>

<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book by Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb printing on the side of a letter, which was written by a double-time in the 1700-he years who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, to see the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the produced hyena heads at the walls and the bottles, the centuries spent in the ditch.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it may not be even crazy, a new report comes across technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, really.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, emeriated professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye-color of the robot, its form of nipple and type of fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are worried about it, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharon in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuds have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon conferment that feels warm in touch - with aware human reactions, which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also adjust its robot according to its beliefs, "and select everything from the eye-color of the robot concerning the form of nipples to the type or colour of its fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots would possess the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a steppe-woman progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuds have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt its robot to the properties which they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots with pre-programmed people like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the Website of True Conion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So you like what you like and they don't like what you like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "it can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in tuning!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient feminine traits, the references to rape, if one goes one step to Frigid (called here: reprieve) Farrah is, bewilful one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true true 'spy Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibration, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fairy or just a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and their increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course do not hold any sex robots, and while FRR notice their increasing popularity, they remain provisional at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what permeates from the edge-zones can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">But there is a certain reasoning that these highly developed sex robots are occurring in a time when the rights of women are threatened in the world, in which there is a president in the White House who is praising women sexually attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphic images, the wiped body and the outtoken eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (although with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their peers want to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, to the point, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are no real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They can not separate or just walk away from her companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no placement, or a background story, nothing that hinders on independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Other words: they are fake slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the speech of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps big performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney to the epitome of healthy human</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a binary of the Trump era that polarized political spouses that have split the U.S. voters to also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Erntethankfully there were newspapers with advice on how to handle the horror of the tick-chosen relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We all told us all to let our filter blisters leave.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps, to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I chose this because my Cousine, a leftist poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family for a long time this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful enemy against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the republican relationship, with whom they had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite peculiar on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it also falls to me that this will bring significant risks to me.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the uniting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and "Trump," we refer to the gruselty possibility that no more will be billed to us for one day.</seg>
<seg id="2436">But there is an even more frightening long-time scenario, in which Trump Republicans of the right wing, "normalized" which suddenly appear as a term of reasonable price compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself nowadays from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomic version of the madman - the dog on the car model, which saw 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked at) - which both occur when compared to Trump in effect of a very mild criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel of Central Park, the largest of the carnells of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals are turning to look at full fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatic music conveying this in surprising ways.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings are old, the skylines will become familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the themes-pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, Central Park-Karussell is still a strange magical experience, as here two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-s can go to it and have all a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could evaluate the carousel, I would have given him the full scores, but fortunately no one had asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale ranging from one to five stars during this week before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">At the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tips - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This leads not only to a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor wife in the department store was excusable, while I felt tired the experience to submit her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">He was transferred to the hospital in the last year because of the treatment of sleighs to the hospital, which he suffered the prison authorities according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was sentenced to an appeal for an appeal to prosecutors to an appeal of the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius asserted that he kept his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder that hidden himself in the cab.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year imprisonment of Pistorius Appell, from which they say they are too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "the national law prosecutor said that they will be reckoned at the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa, and the objection could be heard this year." ""</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claimed the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition that affects approximately 1.3 million and in the UK 300,000 affects gastric, recurrent diarrhoea, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected usually fall to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner Artenschutzübereinkommen that the essential amino acid tryptophan are contributing to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to make sure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food, do not enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that have been able to extinguish inflammation, are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">When the equilibrium too far into the direction of inflammation tends to result from it a inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments were determined that a type of tolerance conveying immune cell on mice occurs that carry out a certain bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium uses tryptophan - one of proteins's components - to emulate the image of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterias - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">It suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of tryptophan rich nutrition suggests, less inflammatory bowel, if the same system is also wirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorate in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan explored a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance when they found out that a group of study arouses had such cells, but another group of the same tribe who was separated from them.</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbial of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The Därme of the mice were detected DNA sequentes and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them misses on mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a mortal environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria committed to the immune system, the researchers can grow L. reuteri in an fluid and then led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">As the active component from the liquid was purged, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-metabolism which is known as Indol-3-lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food processing, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanous were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us are protecting L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal markets.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells steamed inflammation towards the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">"" "potentially high tryptopous values in the presence of L. reuteri lead to an extension of this population." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report entlastet Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse of the Pope George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the abuse scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen continued for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weismann, spokesman of the reform movement "We are Church," stated after publication in front of the German press Agency, he expects from the former Rainsburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the emeried pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve to serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would like to express their profound regret on their own omissions or their back then false assessment of events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newsletter "Osservatore Romano," however criticized that in reporting about violence at the Domspatzen is measured with "two levels."</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the attacks in Regensburg no one doubt that it must be punished by "shameful and shameful deeds" handle, however the "degree medial manipulation," thus the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics committees.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to designate the catholic church as a source of all evil, is already part of the everyday experience and preparing the public opinion that is for normal" wrote Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis supposed to be in an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would love to go on the church and that's a found fressen."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "moreover, it pointed out that in her youth" "" "bats" "" "were a quite normal pedagogical means" "" "to be with sassy children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abnormalities, often Pope Georg Ratzinger often emerged.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who dealt with Ratzinger's memorabilia "My brother of Pope" (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesman," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he adds the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the clarification of the lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 Rainsburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plouting" "" "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, which was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg: "in summary, it is defined that by Domkapellmeister R. were applied in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also be violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, contrary to numerous other allegations, the fact that many victims estimates the general humanity from R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even link positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, why the final report for the abuse scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion are relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Preincidents of Violation Practice," "" "is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "for a lift, many students stand forth his" "" "humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">For the other he appears as a choleriker and perfectionist that was able to take the ocher's hand, if a domain was musically set no top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his Biograph?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: when one turns into the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the rear, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is particularly dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly spoken by any suspicion or fellow-words in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the acts of violence at the preschool took place outside his sphere of efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can blame him if you're going too late or not take the first hint seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengar school in which he worked, was perceived from virtually all respondents as - as literally - "salvation", "" Heaven "and" better world. "</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus the wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents a very excellent reference, "sincere," "sincere," "sincere" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teacher, who catered the guys with cakes, biscuits, and bondage, and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to tantrys.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only cast with chairs and cast the keyhole on the ground but also ear-ears, and too distracted guys went to the hair or ears, he even has been given years ago, deeply regrets and excused for this.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his volunteers must be said, however, that such educators in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, at parents like with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such rebreeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool is that of course dredging.</seg>
<seg id="2926">You wonder if it is not to do with his familiarity and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media has just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">On the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood it, still are eager to work.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media in connection with the report, a lot was reported on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also put any dissertation or compassion in terms of sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the cathedral-kapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said a dupe for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is, however, that most of the victims are not silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulate it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he would have had timely findings and would have been able to stop the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that... Buzzling a haunting or more clear, or more likely to be opened, compared with their parents, inter-natsguides, teachers, etc." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students affected in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">Regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every fellow-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">It cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to connect his good name with these diswardly crimes, as it was unfortunately in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media was a lot of" "" "violence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former cathedral-kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is discarded in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in the coverage it was mixed and deceived was a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly what is an abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, it is kept clean: between the prentiment and the grammar school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, we say again, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report has been dealt with in the period since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral manager.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases where lad were faded and maligned and maltolerable, were all on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous states have to be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, for he got the boy only to face when they were already on the school-school-school-school.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as the most witnesses stress, the subject "prentice" tabu.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "it was only happy to escape it and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" "" "heavenly" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different in the Domspatzengar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there is discipline that has been discipline, but there is no profound violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" "" "many victims estimates the general humanity from R., and therefore in many cases, despite violence even link positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">So most still remains the accusation to be looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported from states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the processes at a school where he had not worked and responsible, (such a witness) did not want to hear, and then again until 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently pursued the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral-school school, even reproduces the report.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out to that" "" "that in the pre-school the test will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Already in light of the danger of negative media outlets, he recommended urgent invading.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test of testing was forbidden in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they did take place in a legal gray area, as each of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate correctly, where those affected are perhaps excessive or dramatised, and where really the permitted border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say he had always looked at.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the test of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Fürstin Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained that yes, it is unfair to apply the educational standard to the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the "Fallstrick of Anachronism," thus the danger to evaluate the past moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was stacked in the preschool of resistance and violence against inculpable teabels, that goes far beyond that time usual.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, thus earns and to pull to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">As a physical punishment then it was forbidden to strictly adhere to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which image from his rainy season has Georg Ratzinger, because in the conversations with you for the book "My brother of Pope '?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test? also the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, because the cathedral-spatzen also played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not understand that he took a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But that also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without the unilaterally unconditionned discipline, it would probably have been possible for him to form an institution of World trang up to the true Cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which entered the tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and bondage alone, you do not even make a big singer and stand before every success, just in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with their book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond, I met Georg Ratzinger over and over and over again a wonderful, humorous, inflatable, deep-believing and heart-good people, from which one could not imagine that he could only distract one fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive how many former Domspatzen still get in touch with him today, 23 years after his embarking, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him today that he was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are today grateful to him that he enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly that may be - but also a lovely disrespect to which she still watch and honor them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clear: everything you reproach are guardians that were at the time of the day.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man, only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intention behind it which is not so obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">Because the report that was just published, relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">"" "" "" "now the rise of people, a 93-year-old man, who acquired great merits and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen (" "" "finally in peace)." ""</seg>
