Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on : I always put in drawers .
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on must not always be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made clear the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always plug@@ ged into drawers or move from the outside label that usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself did not wish to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are rather sch@@ nu@@ b . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ ist@@ on ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are over@@ man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Co@@ pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they said in the fast Gal@@ lop at home to the for@@ te@@ e@@ gen .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and with this the horse@@ men ended then again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament winners - again near horses .
he left himself with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse sw@@ ang he did not try to look for photo .
it was the first time in Aachen , and therefore at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports @-@ help handed out the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Co@@ pyram@@ ide .
on awards it lacks the sympathetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ ic@@ ose , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour of the year ...
even the British Queen has already gotten it out .
a long is the 18 prize winners of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met his first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring .
and so he gave the prize of 25.000 Euro as well .
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two American master@@ ship was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports . &quot;
among the excellent include the cor@@ pse Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , the fai@@ ries Corn@@ elia Han@@ hard , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ eh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard wonder@@ full .
many of these sports le@@ vers were on Saturday after Aachen .
after the official part emigr@@ ated to the illustr@@ ator society into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ umps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and avoid the Trade Agreement of T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
nevertheless , the two U.S. presidential competitors are concerned with tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental request .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the p@@ ale rather small in doubt and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to condemn the economy of death and regulate death , he says .
but he himself would be completely different , claims Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to perform , he has a disadvantage for opening up opportunities and needs money .
therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both of them are very close to the theme of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost like to do .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state Investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the government @-@ critical t@@ oo@@ y wings of the re@@ public@@ ans .
so there is still a party @-@ internal discussion on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policies are evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and rebuild the coal production in the United States .
oil production should also be made possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement he wants to denoun@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton in contrast will explicitly aim to boost renewable energies with their investment programme and challenges : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will create the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreements , do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time both of them want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade but just protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans are to be paid better then , for instance Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ ammed , then he says , it should not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months might well be likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics regard him , so that the budget deficit would only be even bigger .
on the other hand Clinton , who at least want to ask the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics are saying : more taxes are also not the solution .
escape : &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is one of women who run alone , almost to everyday life .
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen four women are sitting .
each has a baby , which is at most a year old .
a little son has put her little son into my arm .
he hung with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until it notes that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
it is the business manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social support offerings in Bavaria , and is concerned with the subject of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen were lying down .
they live in Munich &apos;s North in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for ever @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs founded the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ chner Women &apos;s Aid .
un@@ long she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no - but not as a visitor .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they may be persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a ray of hope for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many ste@@ aling themselves &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , hon@@ ors , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , nar@@ rated life .
also here all the women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worsen@@ ing if ab@@ used .
that leads to some 90 percent of women who live in Munich &apos;s accommodation , have been traumati@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children have certainly not created voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so familiar that they have nothing to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t trust to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they often do not want to help , there would be more accommodation just for them , asks B@@ ahr .
the seven districts of Bavaria are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , &quot; reply some with no .
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken approximately , there is such a thing in the government &apos;s accommodations .
even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women were not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government .
in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common accommodations or homes only for single women and their children .
the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women and Gender equality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published to the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy or will be taken together for men and women , it may be to - constant violence against women . &quot;
the wash@@ rooms should be easily accessible and easily accessible to women is available in the study .
how much the women feel this protected need , you can get the cr@@ ush , which there is in the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for dealing with us , that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
general practitioner : demands for new working measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proxy for the Ass@@ istance Assembly have called their trade union to approve new working measures on their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded his entire advice from beginning September to approve more labour resistance .
the J@@ DC said that ministers failed to address the concerns regarding the contract .
assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract which was agreed with BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government was &quot; per@@ ly calm &quot; about problems , which resulted in the treaty was rejected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Management Board voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations on all these issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today provided a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to approve a run program E@@ SC@@ A measures which starts early September .
the disputes led to the assistance of the Ass@@ istance Assembly this year , the first total waste in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istance Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana joined the approval of the agreed contractual conditions imposed by the BM@@ A , who were recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place before the vote through 5@@ 4,000 assistance and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Health Minister Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and proc@@ laim an official end to the eight months of prolonged war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in receiving , I cannot f@@ end to the expression that Ankara wants to reconcile this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were black@@ ened , and he hardly had warmth of himself , even for his back @-@ time conditions .
Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan , on the other hand , spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I could no longer count it .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve .
the next day she described a newspaper , that Erdogan would have beha@@ ved so badly as if never happened a bad thing .
I seemed rather the opposite to indicate the opposite .
but one of Putin des@@ radi@@ ant , sustainable refriger@@ ation showed that the State of Russia had not forgotten anything .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the fire of a Russian fighter plane in the Syrian border with Turkey .
Moscow was back in response to time .
Putin shared and acc@@ ented Ankara to please Russia in the back .
the accident was even bigger , as it was committed by a supposedly friend .
the met@@ ric to rebuild again becomes difficult , if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media resulted in a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed that the Turks would carry the blame for everything .
the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdogan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria would have prof@@ ited from the so @-@ called &quot; Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look ahead .
finally this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire clear on the hand .
Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after spending the last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually attract several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
tour operators and charter companies will be relie@@ ved when flights are taken again .
you will count on a late season at the Mediterranean Sea .
this week anticip@@ ates the state of television , cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ ams are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in V@@ demographic sti follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is li@@ vid to the West as it regards its reaction to the tried to take power over weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the ongoing Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ails of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ cks is to gain benefits from the cool atmosphere and to reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian state leader won a bonus in Ankara with security for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat , for the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is well @-@ known for Moscow and has a sense of course , which itself has a profound fear of regime change .
the summit in this smooth Palace on the sea made it possible Russia and Turkey , as it once described me an analy@@ st once described &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries , who shut themselves down from the West and feel bad and now ign@@ ited .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support counter@@ antagon@@ istic sides .
it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of first discussions , both President on the press conference said that they would not even comprehend the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately failed to respond to a question about its differences , while Putin decided to stress this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months more open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect dis@@ vice , when NATO members with@@ drew the Russian battle jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will at least talk with one another .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced more to a back office according to the Bank &apos;s shareholders .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for clients outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan gave the BBC Scotland with that the brand R@@ BS associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago and it had to be saved .
at this time Tra@@ de@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands .
they supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands in the focus now .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all R@@ SB references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock exchange are listed at Nat@@ l .
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other , smaller brands for the private customer business that will get more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a visit tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the R@@ SB is becoming one of our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand in which our employees are employed as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now , that we do not pursue global targets , but to pursue local goals .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brand of brands , because how do we focus on inside ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; said the Board of Directors .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can get these brands again , so I think that the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction with its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit in New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori don@@ ates champagne after a double with New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th profit
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori held on Friday his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win in New@@ market .
he sat at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which was trained by John Gos@@ ling , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth yo@@ ckey which reached the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ go@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ ha@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won before G@@ ha@@ y@@ yar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that this has happened at New@@ market because I have landed here 30 years ago .
it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a bank@@ rupt Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am relie@@ ved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he gets the victory on pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a rec@@ ord@@ able career .
L@@ ester pig@@ kin , the ninth der@@ by@@ l had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age , and there is no surprise that he achieved this milestone few of him reached .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic Ambassador to race , enthusiasm and char@@ ism , fans have been enth@@ r@@ alled for this sport for many years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said the Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 winn@@ ings if he would not only be a weekend and a big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already more than 30 years of winning players , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying finishes in Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British low@@ lands for two decades .
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including its famous &quot; glorious Seven , &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug ban .
three years ago he got into trouble when he returned from his six month , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and return to its existence .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue with competitions until his or at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russia Putin feu@@ d staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expec@@ tedly to his staff , Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the most popular trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old has been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s have arranged his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was appointed since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
1972 was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , in 1972 he made his gradu@@ ation at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was director of Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment he said to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as a president in law , and to support the implementation of your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV broadcast@@ er on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putin and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as a staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the staff viol@@ ates his own request .
but despite sm@@ iles to the cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the result of a sort of power struggle ?
this is not what nobody knows at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who was once appointed as a potential President , would first like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came towards great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to trust a job for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December of 2011 .
previously he was deputy prime minister and Defence Minister .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the Security Council of K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( F@@ SB ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted in most .
once was thought that Ivan@@ ov could go to Putin &apos;s second term as President of Russia , since a third presidential term had rejected a coup against the constitution .
but this post was taken by another , close to Putin &apos;s allies , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin was Prime Minister , before he became president in three and a half years later .

ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of the fish help in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act on the 75 fishing around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were split by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Queens@@ ferry crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ bridge ferry cross@@ aire with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four ship@@ ments of the &quot; Deck@@ b@@ lower &quot; which approach each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ lim@@ le .
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister for Defence , Keit@@ h Brown , visited the site for a visit and was one of the first to come to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ bridge ferry cross@@ wise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 ton concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the whole bridge ro@@ cks at its place and the last section of the de@@ cks gets in Ros@@ y@@ th a beg@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the entire Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; the first agreement represents a significant milestone in each Brü@@ cken@@ project .
this fantastic project provides the development of tr@@ end@@ setting high @-@ quality and low @-@ mining industry .
after the installation of the last road @-@ cover and its connection with that in the expansion of the north @-@ deck , we had to close the still existing void in the North or Land page .
this was reached by dra@@ gging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity .
massi@@ vely , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be moved from about 3 % to the top .
heat , as the toler@@ ances that the team have been working , were tiny - on each side they bore only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were cast off from their fishing boat in front of fro@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ station took on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm , after a crew was watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulties to swim in security , while their boat moved out of their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank@@ fully , the strong winds the boat took even out of its range until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and at a sea @-@ hanging without life@@ jacket has been found .
they all arrived on board of the shore boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men that were cast into the water have luck and to be alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot@@ engine had a p@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , however , that sol@@ ves , however , at the bottom of the bot of the person who controlled the boat .
someone has awakened today about these men .
badly hurt - man sti@@ cht on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the non@@ violent offen@@ ders the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when this came into the apartment , he wrote twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured on hand and on the body .
the police could take the perpetrators .
during the 50 years the clothes ind@@ ented his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother .
this aler@@ ted then as a sister .
together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road , they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
when the two women played the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister went on his side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors will be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD suggests a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the next round session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost the question is : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is so far missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Green : who wants to build urban areas in the future , 20 percent of all the apartments must be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social flats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can however also be continu@@ ance @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the great issue in the city hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you want to build with investors to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to create such areas at least 10 per cent , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments are built as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal construction programme , which costs millions of costs and needs to be financed only , is designed for incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , such as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the factions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left still wants to be har@@ sh@@ ness for investors .
regardless of what Brat@@ mann , eased is a tigh@@ tening of the situation in the housing market .
if the action concept is implemented , it will provide for additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
but the program is not completely full of : because the about 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how do you like the loss of other about 1300 cheap apartments , which will work out for the next few years ?
500 apartments will be 500 apartments by 2020 .
to prevent this , so the plan@@ atory speakers at Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city .
furthermore , it would have to be thought of getting apartments back into price .
this is possible in the West city .
at one fell sw@@ oop the problem could solve .
because in the West city the yearly deadlines are running out .
around 1800 apartments you could get back in the discounts for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies .
for the number of social housing in the western city has dramatically increased , one gets from the goal of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling .
there is no need to be a concentration of social weak in only a few urban districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be on board with the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction sites for family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that not yet another compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth
it is fascinating to watch how the world changes .
that teenagers and children are no longer going outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time outdoors , to rigid on screens , has been compl@@ ained last decade from many be@@ ati@@ sed .
at Pok@@ emon Go it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and get more active .
the time on screen was initially limited on the TV , then video games and last on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an App that is based on the characters , which were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later emerged a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July .
market launch in other countries was postponed due to massive demand that the server over@@ load .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , the players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mons that are followed by a GPS and once they were found once found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation who played the game when she was even younger , closed down the whale and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. the game led to a considerable increase in steps that with@@ draws the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , who pursu@@ es 3@@ 5.000 users , shared the Washington Post recently , that within two days of the launch of the game , the number of watched folks who coach each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to arrive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ el to num@@ b ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
who drives regularly sport reduces its odds of suffering from cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here .
but the wonderful on Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun .
some people join in hunting even new friend@@ ships .
as usual , there are also m@@ astic game cor@@ rupted , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what should it be ?
it has become a breakthrough .
even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit has already been able to trace our activity earlier , they do not give us reason to drive sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its charm and use it with time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and be able to help many people on the hunt to be active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic at the jumping horse .
effortlessly on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now also Olympi@@ asi@@ an .
the 19 @-@ year old Tur@@ ymn@@ ast er@@ cl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi@@ plying title and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ it@@ sk@@ amer@@ ic@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Medal , Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es beg@@ s on the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken during the lon@@ gl@@ it@@ ome of women in the art tournament during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American player who wins a multi @-@ struggle title and the fifth , while she has made its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all .
she broke into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey was found at this moment .
this success is the same league as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years their sport , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ asi@@ an from 1984 Mary Lou Ret@@ ton of her said that she &apos;s &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast I have ever seen . &quot;
they expected to be a last test in Brazil , a contest which did not work so much between making Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations .
not returned with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be viewed as disappointment .
the Americans are Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after having won gold and silver in the individual multip@@ lication of women in the arts summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she was at the farewell ceremony that was reti@@ ring in retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi pre@@ appointed as a pan@@ nier .
although Bil@@ es insisted on the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their ground exercises - which would contain its typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by their grandparents as a small child and by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the g@@ ymnasi@@ um was discovered , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the force .
it has lost no more competition for the summer of 2013 , a winning series that will last for as long as it desires .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina was slightly led through two screen@@ ings , the image dra@@ gging the image .
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ken and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship - lau@@ ghed .
she won again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and with an 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor nor on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently as they expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ é - a pure mould - and tears streams in Bil@@ es red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection @-@ book , became reality .
the Power Ra@@ is@@ mans was an revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina was going .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ year teams had called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their ground exercise , they threw to the public Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes was doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for making it , the fast broad@@ ening twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a whole new meaning :
police : 3 victims in serial mur@@ ders in the music hearing in the car
according to police reporting that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ derer from Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a palm @-@ fire , while he rose on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is in the report .
the police shared that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ over , as the Att@@ acker did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who took possession of an adult victims .
the police spokes@@ person from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting for the investigation began to become a closer look at it , whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
overall , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic residen@@ ces were killed within four months in nine attacks seven people and two others injured .
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month .
it is thought that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles including a brown n@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
Ellis , 33 , has been hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to their injuries and died later .
Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which led to an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder and from which it was assumed that it was the work of a serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ sle@@ eves and safer a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the engine .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys , and of course his mother .
but as the least of his Alter@@ ed has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy did nothing knew .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I made it not .
I don &apos;t manage it .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which is not true at all - of course one has settled in it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund she will never recognize it under circumstances and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first response to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to .
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor cro@@ oked up to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he loves to play with his two brothers and singing .
Elizabeth shows the sign @-@ language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing something in front of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language in , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic like in Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as mas@@ ons or the Zi@@ k@@ avirus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the zi@@ pper .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds himself of the emotional price of a certain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will be done ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for a prognosis for a long time because I wasn &apos;t expecting someone to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avirus .
it gets better .
you know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi
fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana st@@ aves the governor who created the emergency on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned all the Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
numerous streams in southeast Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their bank and threatened with large @-@ scale floods to extreme rainf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards shared that government officials are standing in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected municipalities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ c the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multip@@ lied .
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa ended ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system will be used over large parts in the south Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service agreed that in this area you could drop additional 3 to 5 inches on rain .
in the south of Alab@@ ama , a Fl@@ ut@@ an early @-@ system was used , while in the area of Mobile continues to rain .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach track record .
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could fly many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a de@@ th@@ down@@ ward floods into Ascension is a threat , since these rivers will only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ r@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue team still t@@ apped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts Am@@ ites and Wil@@ kinson in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son found themselves among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , by night strong increase .
he said that another step @-@ man who lives nearby , had warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flo@@ cked in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it got my wa@@ ist .
his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years where she lived there , never had such a high rise of the river .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabled , and he would be the only one who can swim .
Han@@ ford said that No@@ th@@ el@@ fer had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military trucks and brought them to the next fire@@ guard in Glo@@ ster where they were staying till Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; had quickly spread out , as there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities need ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer held near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning by 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil is severely sc@@ aled by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rainf@@ alls and road floo@@ ding the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and schol@@ ar were caused in five class@@ rooms .
the C@@ BS subsidiary of WW@@ L reported that a passenger in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 sw@@ amped houses attached .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now both flooded .
the rulers of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed by the flood .
in the cities Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond have been appointed to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; once the water starts to come back , they will be able to walk back into their houses , &quot; he said .
in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets were closed due to the flood @-@ waters and sand@@ bags for residents to take care of their homes , which we hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops .
&quot; the last great flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in the tip , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison says that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his statements a handful of houses on Thursday were reported as flooded , but on Friday were not reported until now .
Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by sco@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survived in Philadelphia
the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy has been shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot .
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grandparents passed that Brown had several shot injury , including in the loose , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in his transportation to the hospital in consciousness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was burnt with balls &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ch@@ z to the radio station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can simply not believe this .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy divided the transm@@ itter with that he is expected to recover again .

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I pres@@ cribes for me under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ ic vessel and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been at every summer Olympic Games since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez who inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin colour .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lic@@ in is , round , makes every pride .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic player and America during the last Olympic Games .
now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , but master@@ ful g@@ ym@@ as@@ tical routines .
on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold for women in an individual @-@ class event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we are experiencing the tip of this sport , but we do not see any turn@@ around in the whole country .
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; last five &quot; because the next Olympi@@ as will only have four tur@@ ner@@ ship in the team . besides , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer .
but the reality looks like g@@ ymnas@@ tics is a more expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private Turn@@ stones which will be maintained by parents who pay for training , furnis@@ hing , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their families and families ) . the list can continue to continue .
the majority of these sne@@ akers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can assist the business .
in these associations , the Tur@@ ner get their whole training and that &apos;s for the families an expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ er by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes , since they started with the tower .
we need to be inspired to the churches of countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a high @-@ performance and easier access @-@ to @-@ gym .
I was founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
during my events , we offer free and affordable turbines in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ nes that earn the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ ning develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits to health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the g@@ ymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ as of the olymp@@ ic team gol@@ ds and thank you , f@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start healthy , strong and successful young women .
general practitioners would like to organize other strikes after calling Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes through acceptance of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ ,000 employees who voted on a election , rejected him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t plans revealed to introduce the treaty and said that N@@ HS was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance should be given a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend work in order to improve the maintenance of odd times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the President of the BM@@ A Com@@ bin@@ aries shared last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance professionals have made serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will cause the current staff crisis and to deal with it to treat all the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time goes out .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve the disputes resulting in conversations with the government for res@@ s@@ akes , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
the happened of a promise that Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had first made about it last month that his door would always open .
&quot; Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t needs to act now , to lift the res@@ pl@@ eness and address the concerns of the assistance . &quot;
should he not do this , the assistance sal@@ aries made clear that they are ready to carry out further working measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine co@@ operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and practitioners were included to provide doctors on the strike chain .
the Ministers hoped to end the dispute over changes through acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better wave re@@ mun@@ er@@ ation for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS staff , urged the assistance to end the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour emergency measures reached nothing of the only little , but they are already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing homes and their families only concerns , need and interruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months , we have spoken to the Com@@ missions of the Ass@@ istance Par@@ ents and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries , responded positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings .
the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ism can blos@@ som in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ for Rah@@ man was arrested last year on ev@@ ac@@ uation of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ c has led to un@@ wi@@ ped that the common election was un@@ know@@ ingly ignored in Muslim communities as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ esses the police , electoral rolls and Rath@@ le@@ ys to have evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister for integration and communal government , who now is a rup@@ rup@@ tion@@ sk@@ in@@ ely , said that intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so badly that it should be allowed to protect the police outside of electoral rolls to cut down elec@@ trot@@ ter .
he recommends that voters should lead a identification with themselves to prove their identity when elections .
at present a vot@@ er must only name its name and address .
the report proposes , not remot@@ ely inks to the finger of a person when they give up their vot@@ ings to prevent anyone twice .
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official com@@ promised or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election , but also the local government in front of the broader corruption and finance culture that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Pol@@ sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special court , that the am@@ using Mayor Lut@@ r@@ Rah@@ man decided to be dis@@ missed after a L@@ itan@@ ei in corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ple@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal fashion , &quot; and that he might have sil@@ enced its critics of se@@ gregation and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign should be based on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation where one person is choosing from others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said that there would be evidence of fraud across the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent presidential election - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the election system , including filling out to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; as evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members was exercised by some ethnic minorities , particularly women and young people in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or bank@@ roll background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour would be un@@ question@@ ably ignored because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including ban , to process political activ@@ ist correspondence to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , is also called tough@@ er registration inspec@@ tions to prevent the electoral directory to im@@ migr@@ atory and social be@@ ad@@ missions .
consider options , voters before choosing to ask for your identification .
not removing Tin@@ te on the finger of a person when she gave her voice to prevent anyone to choose twice .
systematic inspec@@ tions about the nationality of a person to carry out to make sure that they are op@@ tionally entitled .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic letter code .
ban on that political activists are editing complete let@@ ons and envel@@ oping of envel@@ ops .
the police give the authority to set lock@@ out around election stations .
a legislative change , which facilit@@ ates an indictment for intimi@@ dation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Parti@@ cipation Act in 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing offered in el@@ ective stations .
request that only English in the voting stations can be used ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees take the rule that voters go alone to the cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no sentences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy for corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ disabled , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been guilty on a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also has critic@@ ised the effective &quot; waste controls &quot; of the municipal registration departments .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Geri@@ cht@@ sur@@ pass in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a War@@ n@@ signal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country is a proud heritage than the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of constitu@@ encies and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band who has proved to be impressive semi @-@ performer from Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to win gold fighters who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not to give faith in social media .
hon@@ our@@ ing the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces who runs at our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ad that have more than just a certain similarity with wood @-@ wood@@ p@@ ines .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o
apart from K@@ ates Doppel@@ gänger on the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ ink there are many people on the Internet to be like a certain arch@@ ar@@ cher of the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o .
the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star scary .
in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the madness in the social media and revealed that he has already heard about his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big similarity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I must do it as compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the center : the overwhelming similarity between the British Wi@@ jum@@ pers Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian Tur@@ ymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expres@@ sive eyes shall be able to go through a double @-@ group for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a further sustained comparison was brought between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similar eyebrows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the ac@@ tress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ ested Adrian by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face @-@ form and eyes
not the only ones : a Twitter user was very happy about the fact that others are similar to similarities
theory posed into the room : according to this user , there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple perhaps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained its satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the American football @-@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ac@@ tress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes .
further popular comparisons of Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical with the ac@@ tress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal in the Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , wide smile , that resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard on which he asked him a lot of speech .
Twitter users didn &apos;t hold back when they heard how uns@@ ha@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # Ma@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you are presenting the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment from Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a unhappy chosen formulation , so sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC exc@@ used in the end over 90 times in the people who respon@@ ds to the comments on Twitter
the comment@@ ator @-@ mate Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also exc@@ used quickly and gave a communication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible that they will be aired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night we quickly used our spectators on shipment and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify some bytes , By@@ ron &apos;s comments refer to the power of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy chosen formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the mission was apologi@@ zed and tried to justify its remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment for me to apologize for the comment I &apos;ve made after the women &apos;s circuit squ@@ ab@@ el in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ 2015 , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have moved on the power of s@@ wimm@@ ers and not related to it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course there was no dis@@ cont@@ emp@@ t , and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark emp@@ ts about woman , who tries to wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to see them when a woman went out their clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ t@@ osen .
to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered , as she saw it out , drew her out and put them back into the shelf .
you continue to browse further and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , in which the woman sam@@ pled the under@@ pants before putting it back into the shelf
a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , &quot; she moved back and left the business without anything to buy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of shel@@ ters from the out@@ board , pulled off their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; she did not even tried to find a more discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone sm@@ iled , when she returned the under@@ pants , who obviously didn &apos;t like her , because she put her back into the shelf again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she reiter@@ ated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she lost nothing to go back and left .
&quot; it did not seem to bother anyone watching or thinking about the person that would under circumstances buy the sub@@ tro@@ users they had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluc@@ tant to think that someone would take shelter with home which had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got involved , the employees tried to pull the pieces from the sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and finding out that another woman had her and returned and did not have been washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident occurring on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against weapons
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail.com could make him a little more secure .
we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York , to find out how to convert to armed rob@@ bers to the near distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or behind the rear , this video will show you how you change the mirror for your rob@@ ber .
if you turn to you from behind , then you should turn up yourself as a first turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker and get off from the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon then between your for@@ arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bow .
then hit him with his knee into the void and rot@@ ate while the att@@ acker comes together before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while they turn the weapon onto it .
with att@@ ackers you approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the shot line , seize the weapon and turn it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot .
transfer the weight to the gun at the same time and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then rot@@ ate the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and turn the weapon onto it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it Miz@@ ra@@ chi predic@@ ts .

travel Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide on his tongue in the dirty locations of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and throws in a serious test - by completing some of the most dirty and most potent places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sli@@ pped up his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a flush on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a dishwasher kno@@ b with a Zug@@ toi@@ lette as well as a public phone in Russia to prove the immune system of its immune system .
in front of the death of each object , he used a lumin@@ ous to show ourselves and to show us what he is going to get .
but the experiment , which was used under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ reng@@ th , brought some surprising results .
the thought , the sink button of a draw@@ toi@@ lette blade , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact are in a kitchen sink more bad bacteria .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right with doctors and medical specialists said about the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he left , more than a bad night@@ fall in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world and ate especi@@ al as well as wonderful things .
from public funds to train stations up to dish@@ wash@@ y of toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial @-@ coating showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ ic number of over 4000 units .
compared to this the L@@ umin@@ escence is fresh washed , less than 60 .
but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om , which he refused to refuse , after their L@@ umin@@ escence was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands one out of less than 60
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ dating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ reng@@ th &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows the bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst of what I did in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will do nothing here because it is ec@@ static here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner St@@ reng@@ th &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products .
the Company will re@@ funded Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ sen@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer something new .
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explaining the benefits of probi@@ otics .
we led crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended that we said &quot; L@@ ass to call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
instead of talking only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in the gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide the consumer with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who was the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I had lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have told him , just as the ec@@ static Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things , in which it was easier to give Ian to get it , and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we have recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents have been associated with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ine , especially with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing enclosed , l@@ actic acid bacteria .
A@@ social family destro@@ ys pre @-@ emp@@ t@@ ying social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left their social apartment after a del@@ oc@@ ation with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they wre@@ cked their neighbours .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ pic@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their estate , the coun@@ cill@@ ors found the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition .
the walls reported ap@@ pr@@ ing holes in , wood di@@ mp@@ s were opened , rub@@ b@@ ish was disper@@ sed at the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls .
the family were res@@ umed and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said they feared that the apartment would no longer be repaired .
she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider because this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror that had inf@@ lic@@ ted the family , battles with bases , and intimi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , and passing scre@@ ams , stri@@ ps and flu@@ xes .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement of anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
they were tra@@ ded in the estate , where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past .
neighbours told they had to fight it on the streets and regularly called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing grants her and her partner this week by force by the property after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to voluntary escape .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were che@@ ered by facilitated neighbors , they said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; She wondered about anybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived in addition to them for 20 years and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet - we are not familiar !
now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful .
Adam Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long
on the over@@ turned side of the common house , garbage and old toys are thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it fo@@ amed the les@@ h@@ ers to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their families , since a del@@ oc@@ ation is always the last step to take into account Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extremely difficult and its actions were to be taken to look terrible for their neighbours .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the municipality who have been courageous to us and have given us the information we have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development is con@@ sol@@ ent to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is no longer tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fit@@ z@@ patri@@ ck told that all three sons were living in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress , laid down in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ oc@@ ation on the ground
workers of the house management are now to be st@@ amped to garbage , which surround the house
2014 the police led a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ by received a fine sentence after having found guilty of the ownership of a drug of class B in trade @-@ view .
they claimed the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who came to life in 2013 with a car accident .
having stayed without the shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and its partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many rooms of the house were engra@@ ved with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police says that they will be ten@@ ant , who do not stick to the house order
Angela C@@ row from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not stick to the property order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without self @-@ accus@@ ation as well as those who have been damaged by such a behavior &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate a criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .

Catal@@ ans appear in the du@@ el around the Spanish super@@ cup over the FC Sevilla , the back@@ side rises three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ ak must refrain in the cr@@ acks with the under@@ dog C@@ up@@ fin@@ alists and ruling Europe @-@ League champion among others on Ne@@ ym@@ ar , which den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ aly is missing Marc @-@ Andre ter Ste@@ gen .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the question @-@ question of Bar@@ ca is at least prevalent in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen die ranks in Barcelona for two years now as number one .
Coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ oun@@ ced so far on a clear decision and had Bra@@ vo in the league for this , but T@@ er ste@@ gen in most of the remaining applicants .
before the first requirement of the new game time , there is no doubt about the fitness state of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the rehearsal stop against S@@ amp@@ dor@@ ia on Wednesday , Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .
Sevilla again has the 2 : 3 defeat for pro@@ long@@ ation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
Barcelona has so far been winning the record of the record label in this competition .

bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have made it as expected in the final game and made the title among each other .
thus , it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the highest peak box was the former SV@@ S @-@ n@@ ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record alone , between the movements and on time @-@ outs they had no co@@ c@@ aches in itself .
they had withdrawn into the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their in@@ mates in fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches to here I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finals I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang only had said .

the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had to really fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that , he determined the pace of the record and left , there was only a total of 13 points .
due to the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected match .

Donald Tr@@ ump adm@@ its &quot; enormous problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Republi@@ can will be pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative state states to enter their majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump now has given weaknesses of his election campaign in the past Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gau@@ ge and self @-@ confident M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire as something as concerns voiced as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the separate Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts now grow on his success in the struggle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt are false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he picked up his well @-@ known media she@@ dding .
republi@@ can high bur@@ gers
Utah is usually a secure bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and its Con@@ cur@@ r@@ entin of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , equal .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as a threat , Arizona and Georgia are also considered to be endangered .
in an interview by the Sender CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question how he plans to stop the rise of Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is doing nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot;
if for him it would not be rich in the end for reasons of political correctness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to the Press report , the Party has threatened to submit funds to support its election campaign , it should not be able to present any better re@@ frac@@ tures .
instead of accepting the candidates of the Republi@@ can to Congress more strongly under the arms .
Olympics : rotating fraud on D@@ oping @-@ Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary Commission to the event .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud trial in a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to home .
the International Olympic Committee shared with immediately to set up a disciplinary Commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan Fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ary has communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had an urine sample under the name of the 800 meter L@@ ill@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I gave .
this is the team leader of Kenya about the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tor .
the World verband IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C to provide information about the case in order to make own investigations , distributed a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following actions taken by IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; says it in an IA@@ AF explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping Control station and has shown himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I , the rehearsal and signed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Kenya &apos;s head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was owned by the accreditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics Heads of Deleg@@ ation@@ - Michael Rot@@ ich was pulled from the Rio Olympics .
he is intended to be informed of the payments of his country over pending d@@ oping tests .
according to media reporting , he should be arrested in his return at the airport of Nairobi .
Kenya is at the IO@@ C after numerous D@@ oping merits for a long time under special observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the announcement of the IO@@ C more than 2000 D@@ oping targets presented in front of the Rio Olympics , we were clearly pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into the sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia opening .
as a result , W@@ ada Kenya took in Kenya by the list of countries whose dop@@ ing @-@ fighting with the rules of the W@@ ada are .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
in a series of television reports the ARD were repeatedly collected , that in Kenya D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of the sport .
the IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und continued to ask for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had placed them in Russian athle@@ tics .
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ surface and systematic opt @-@ in .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics were then excluded from the summer of the summer .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece .
the artistic director , Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of Classi@@ cal and filled with the role of Mary a youth space .
in orches@@ tr@@ al dig the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ med .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are lots of Latin American ingredients at their pace and tune .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say we have Bern@@ st@@ one &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary .
she reminds himself with melanch@@ oly in her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly , because it is musically exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
so she is clever , of course naive , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character that I have as Roman in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an immense generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passion@@ ately ! &quot;
serving is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a more southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece goes to prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we took the refugees , then the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans came to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
it is the same issues and they are just as expres@@ sive as at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

Turkey : Kurdish municipality anticip@@ ates mass evasion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdogan is sitting on packed bags , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mid@@ end of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany reck@@ oned short notice with ten thousand @-@ thousands of guards coming from Turkey to Germany .
in the medium term , it could be even &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; the association @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes .
because of the tough proposal of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community Germany expects a mass evasion in Germany .
&quot; in the short @-@ term , I reck@@ on with ten thousand , medium @-@ term prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdogan regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the association @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government was over@@ drawn a few months ago with criminal transactions , 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run .
after the van@@ ished put@@ sch and so@@ ber@@ cul@@ ars and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will start anew in Europe if they are going to be re@@ pressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that ga@@ thers refugees in its own country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ pe@@ head def@@ endant the targeted an@@ res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities .
with that Erdogan wants to increase the exhau@@ st pressure on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been wi@@ ped out or marketed in the past hundred years , said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the president called for the federal government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp on Austria against Erdogan and his supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also in Germany there is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wit@@ ch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdogan &apos;s critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not feel secure in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len @-@ Movement also fears the escape of many Turks to the foreign country .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and op@@ position@@ ists .
the Brand@@ ing as Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdogan is sitting on gri@@ pping bags , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ based foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures of the German Federal Ministry of State , the Turks set before the coup the biggest group for asylum seekers in Germany in front of the coup .
at the date of June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 men and therefore barely 29 per cent of all approved as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
this collection does not take place before war , poverty or fu@@ tility of aggression .
asylum seekers after the Basic Law are only politically , i.e. from state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; where to go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer @-@ election campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia may not choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
in 2021 the country @-@ election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the gravity Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for bl@@ iss@@ less than so far it is not about : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ ath @-@ struggle - it bites .
the natives , who are to be convinced by the electoral fighters are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers that are in the countryside , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so do not choose the country day .
in addition , practical problems come : during the holidays are hel@@ pers who are hanging posters , ballo@@ ons , fl@@ yers and ex@@ hal@@ ted at the end of the cast , just rep@@ tile .
until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last summer day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign to Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern close to the people .
the hot phase , if one can say it at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U Coalition , must be afraid to be ministry .
the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
thrilling is how strong newcom@@ er fr@@ y cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 ruling classes , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one can see from his major acc@@ esses .
he travels through the country , spread ro@@ ses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as there were also his legendary @-@ cali@@ ber predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff did .
otherwise past@@ ering has got an old feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel gives the blame for the flowering of the Af@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top @-@ channel data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place .
she has been invited twice the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ; Merkel Bundestag faction is in the northeast .
but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Mecklenburg @-@ West@@ phal@@ ia and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U largely disp@@ ens@@ ed to the usual electoral campaigns on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , then co@@ ert , play only an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sub@@ ordinate roll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also the union has noticed that in the country you have taken away the basis , that they must find themselves very strict , to find a wire with the people again .
you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the vast@@ ness of the country hardly exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election campaign Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Gol@@ dene weddings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering his SPD has now called on an especially dedicated campaign .
in surveys the Socialists and Democrats also last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ ales ( 19 ) .
in the election 2011 the SPD won &apos;t be clear with 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent prior to the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Green , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should be able to make the leap into the day of the country .
they make a modern virtue of holidays in the holidays and lay its electoral campaign largely in the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the Landes@@ chairman Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green pol@@ war@@ fer will embark on trace search for local stim@@ ul@@ ties among the tourists .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ kan@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the Mecklenburg &apos;s lakes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ ting in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : Gast@@ sta@@ ises suffer from Sper@@ n
at the speed , with which the B is 27 sanc@@ tioned , there is nothing to complain about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for the construction of construction , starting at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is any praise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all have done pretty pain@@ st@@ ably , &quot; El@@ vira T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the jet station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is no default .
the construction site could be moved to the weekly back to the half @-@ time planned to the south , until the end of October everything should be ready .
the subject will also be the subject to those responsible for construction work , for example when it comes to setting up Beh@@ ind trips .
since the construction site on Monday to south migr@@ ated and also the block of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse was lifted in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen and therewith , the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation inside the place is relaxed .
the citizens can now go through O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from B 27 again on the sides .
the ex@@ iting traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the responsible management of the reconstruction responsible for the re@@ acting management of the executive director Florian King . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of Bach@@ el@@ or@@ ama , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many s@@ wimm@@ ers were looking and more familiar to their navigation as the sign@@ age .
what led to that some truck in residential areas bl@@ ends itself .
as also the speed b@@ umps are not observed , the municipality will increasingly set aside the meas@@ urer from M@@ ös@@ sing .
&quot; there were considerable trans@@ formations , &quot; says King , who made yourself a position on the spot .
two to three per minute has been lit@@ tered .
the quick@@ est was at 77 km @-@ kilometres at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them to a turnover of revenue , everybody is asked to look through .
however , some more and some are less concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies , for whom the recovery has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z is also talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but of course that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lear@@ ner lacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Local District is the strongest along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the hospitality I have met &quot; hard . &quot;
it was missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil .
we have to be happy about each euro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue equ@@ ated to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road system has left its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been dis@@ missed , politics could have re@@ acted differently .
instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there would be a financial compensation , with the reference answered , the guest house benefited from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it should also include the disadvantages , which result in the reconstruction .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties , where so much gener@@ ously dealt with .
for all charges G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his guest house will continue to pass .
finally , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
that other regul@@ ars are now less common because of the complicated traffic @-@ direction , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also elsewhere too beautiful .
that its stem cell after the end of the refurb@@ ishment has returned , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt .
despite the crises with BS@@ E and Vogel@@ gri@@ ppe , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction works on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the greatest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long history .
six months of work that has been brutal .
constantly being bol@@ ted in the name of the terrorist fight against laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presents a thick security package .
but what has a d@@ ul@@ ment status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ able partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals were &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Minister of Minister for the presentation of his new security system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not asking anybody .
others , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participate in this case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of Interior , he was well located in results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; retreat consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère have a little time after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , they are all the more extensive .
quite a bit is known , announced , that a new security authority to take care of the kno@@ b coded communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU guidelines for passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the safety authorities is also not surprising .
for part , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals that were not to be done with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment and hat@@ ch jihadists with double citizenship of the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sp@@ t the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and demanding nothing , which anyway does not have any chances in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ment .
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
they are partly in themselves : he plans to de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ priv@@ ation of people from deportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are specifically retri@@ ev@@ ed into the country before calling their smartphone and open social @-@ media accounts for a safety check . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for d@@ ul@@ tures for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than so far - about those who commit crimes or throw out their papers in order to conce@@ al their identity .
some of them is political and legally @-@ healing .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and with some points - for the un@@ equal treatment of hurt , for example - raises the question : what actually does this have to do with certainty and terror ?
yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg emigr@@ ated .
many people in the face of the high refugee pay concerns safety .
and things that are deeply employed people were not allowed themselves to complain in election campaign .
inner security is enormous in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are electoral campaigns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Union and SPD can therefore become increasingly in position on the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past few days it was high between the two parties .
only a gar@@ ris@@ ome argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a safety policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , in which the Ress@@ orts is also a Bur@@ ka ban and a shift from the double citizenship .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here about reconc@@ iling sounds .
from a stop from the double @-@ pass he is nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it , be not useful .
and in a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ment process , it is only necessary to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is quite a lot of things that could take care of a dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the SPD is currently attempting to pro@@ ach itself on the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal security &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only a cautious contact and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yet , Volkswagen glimp@@ ses comes through .
despite diesel models , the ex@@ tradition has to be delivered worldwide .
however , it is not going on in all markets .
in the recall , there are verteb@@ ra@@ e around a term .
Volkswagen starts to offer the delivery into the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s biggest highway can be seen in the course of the previous year despite the diesel , thanks to its many brands and several well @-@ moving markets further a plus .
but in July the core brand VW was weak@@ ened above all in Western Europe and to re @-@ sell the overall sales as the company opted in the D@@ ax .
globally , the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , the sales were 14 per cent below the previous year .
in the home market , Germany d@@ gy the deliveries to almost one h@@ exag@@ on .
br@@ anded Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July above all on two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , it was given to a department store in some core markets .
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the res@@ ignation from the EU was deb@@ ited , explained an speaker .
in the USA , where the sc@@ aff@@ aires first escal@@ ated first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech .
a large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is in any way higher than the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months it is merely an ex@@ tradition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech .
the group of group Fred Kap@@ pler continued to report a sales split from January to July .
1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software subscription .
in Germany alone , VW is calling for some 2.5 million vehicles to re @-@ fit into the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the re@@ armament of the vehicles , there are fuel consumption , CO2 emissions , or motor output whatsoever .
the bus service provided the customer after the retro@@ fit an &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in the company &apos;s travel .
the reason are legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen gave its German customers a guarantee for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diesel models &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed on the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of State .
the traffic Ministry was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has to fulfill the requirements of my investig@@ ational Commission and its KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; der@@ og@@ ations of this will not be accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the re@@ armament does not take place , and all the typ@@ ing @-@ relevant vehicle values have to remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the wide term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers for example have a half year after the re@@ armament to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
even in the customer &apos;s interest , it is important to avoid that with any other damage , which at all have nothing to do with the exhau@@ st sc@@ andal that comes to uncertainty with regard to possible warran@@ ties , as it meant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ra@@ i@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see demands of rich as@@ par@@ ders in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it a signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal Spar@@ e@@ er would have to fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not afraid to pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
storing banks all over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay off their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this charge asks the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 cost 400 euros in the year &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been around 40 million euros for a time that could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not be able to utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for every one million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost did he now give to the poll@@ uter @-@ principles &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cash is easy to leave in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four waste , I don &apos;t even like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most customers had understanding and were rarely changed on other assets .
only a few emigr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gen@@ os@@ ci@@ ence verband Bayern explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing a considerable cost at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to carry you alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating @-@ economically permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their fees for accounts , credit cards or credit transfers .
with pen@@ alties for deposits of 3 million Euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land have made headlines with their sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive director of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay for deposits , but competition in Germany and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a banker said , at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cliff which is end@@ owed by the assets something lush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 1911 @-@ founded gen@@ os@@ ci@@ s@@ bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and Te@@ ger@@ n@@ see .
in the region stay known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the gen@@ os@@ ci@@ ence of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate an ex@@ propri@@ ation for deposits of private clients &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Federal Association of German folk banks and Rai@@ ffe@@ isen banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives opposite the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard and there was already the migration of lawyers to the competition .
the customers in Germany will not be enjoyed in the width .
destination plates : who actually purchases Schall@@ platten ?
lonely men middle age love plates .
before you return to the comment@@ ed@@ on to over@@ saw him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ sam@@ le@@ vel@@ v@@ ale men with di@@ gest ins@@ ults , this statement derives from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ licity of sound records does not want to see a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects but back to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are of all predictions according to the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ amm@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older records are retained their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .

if this blog would be a message report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho , a modest gray suit and wild ges@@ tu@@ cked , before I ste@@ er my hands and see something determining how : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly moving to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now fill in the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of outstanding record stores .
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera down for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I know by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young females , three men middle ages ) into the Rec@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , presumably the 20 ) succession , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill a few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed him home ) , dress the walls of his room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates , which he could not afford when they appeared and again bought items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ ite .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early &apos; 7@@ 0s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy plates , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and want to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not very much .
this is my cloth .

he has also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the medi@@ um@@ pe , people who heard about the com@@ eback and let them to buy their old records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the conversations I have led , people usually have been emp@@ tied up to their collection in 1998 or in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of trailers of a set of age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it just takes a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores provides a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some plate @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to pull themselves back to the stability of familiar sound@@ pl@@ atten@@ tions , of objects , the lucky Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says J@@ Z .
this is the case with me as collectors , and I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to be mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of the people bought a record last month , they have not yet been heard .
the survey was also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table which they never use , while 7 % of those who buy one record , who own a record .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while I was pet@@ alled by a stack of the Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at the sounds of the Universe ( count of data : three men middle aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ ph@@ ä@@ en@@ as@@ pe@@ kt &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals .
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own record player , but I would like to buy a radio head record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product las@@ ers , less musicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older , which only slowly come in .
stop , which has got the record almost a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , teen@@ ager and women middle aged .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the pre @-@ standing stores - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and far @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz is to be seen from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such a diversity among customers .
none of them looks faul@@ ty but na@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ectable when you stand beside someone 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around in business for a couple of minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it rather makes a window pe@@ e than a big one .
it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or another way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she is driving with a loved si@@ ghs .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners : Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I &apos;m giving up the light to patterns , I observe a group of young teenagers who group@@ ed for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a cros@@ ley plate .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential plates for an average collection .
nobody looks at her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; turn@@ out . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and to send some clients into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain .
it &apos;s no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects like plates .
even though my research results found that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in turn@@ table in Soho , the large number of female collectors &quot; collectors , which exist in reality , plate business and in online research centres .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they will certainly not spend their Thursday mor@@ nings with security through records of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves by plates , while watching the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator po@@ unded that rises over the shoulders of middle age .

French Court re@@ jects offering of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps .
a French Court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live .
during a trial proceedings , the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ elled to sell 72 provisional transactions , in which subjects within the camp merchandise , sell cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair @-@ services or sell tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais state of Cal@@ ais were argu@@ ing that these places should be crus@@ hed because they would constitute a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which val@@ bard a fire @-@ risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups will not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run 72 provisional business , but adm@@ its that the concerns of Cal@@ ais were absolutely tr@@ ack@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the judges Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feed people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas will offer quiet hits between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places that was threatened by the decline was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s café &quot; the camp who is generally operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos;s café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closing time for this children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migr@@ ants estimates on Friday , that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arri@@ vals during the summer .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation speed measurements : in different Länder , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should perform tem@@ pos@@ ün@@ der particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic acting Enfor@@ cement of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accidents , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites , or to san@@ atorium bridges with temporary Templ@@ ates , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the compliance of the speed limit .
a persistent mobile structure can however be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : his battery is holding five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology can also be recorded at the same time all vehicles over several tracks across the same time .
variable speeds and transit dri@@ lls to time , chassis and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in high @-@ ri@@ dden state , one can move the pend@@ ant to manufacturers with every car with trailer cou@@ pling .
so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is lowered by the Mess@@ enger , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and incidentally also sli@@ pped over @-@ safe outside .
also , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itzer before V@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities even flas@@ hes with the new technique : recently , France has declined 100 pieces after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
the impressive performance of Great Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the finals on Thursday evening to a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were beaten here in Rio on Thursday evening .
Fiji divided a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , res@@ isting , line @-@ up and crude power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color .
defeat was caught by the non @-@ too bad Tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they suggested New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the finals .
but independently of this one would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in existence in this form .
it could be a sol@@ ace for GB but will most likely not - that at least one Br@@ it will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef Ben Ryan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost under Ryan any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here , they lost only one .
this book is we@@ ather@@ ed , but the progress is amazing .
Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of G@@ b@@ S in fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . , as if you run into driving buses . the World Series winners went out 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner .
with even four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai still added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner which he walked .
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely doubled the ball .
a pre@@ ten@@ tious twe@@ et from Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has not stopped using Fiji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right hand side a touch down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the resur@@ rec@@ t and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by another weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB Teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s like being Fiji on how Fiji was born to play 7 during the UK .
this is how it is .
GB carried out fundamental changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a Touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game was running long in favor of the South overseas , whose fans sang , veins and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake icing with another attempt in the last seconds .
the P@@ fi@@ ff ru@@ ded , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB ki@@ cked them crus@@ hing in the lawn .
formerly on the day , Fiji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defeated and Great Britain in South Africa in a kn@@ itted half @-@ fin@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton passed the line with an impressive foot work , and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ tics of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ aside team , won the win - and therefore the silver medal .
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for the Ru@@ der@@ si@@ eg .
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ ist gold than with these games and that will be hot .
from the first stop to the last , 220 hard ho@@ ve that goes into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in her golden moment on Est@@ acio since Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the hat@@ s that sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was omni@@ present as she was awarded for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without wheel@@ ers in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that used such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ ter is un@@ brid@@ led , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant athlete who gli@@ de about the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not the way of trigger it ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on with willing Hel@@ per who make the difference and there was no more assistant than the coach , which was about 30 months ago did not know if he was diagnosed this day at all , as diagnosed with him cancer .
as he said he was risky .
I had bl@@ isters , which is operating and that did so .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start the interruption of a minimum if that under such circumstances is the right term .
I needed money , so I needed to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger .
in the in@@ medi@@ ability of the victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve fir@@ ing morning and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning which was the captain in the Royal Ar@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
without Robin , we would be no one , so many thanks to him . he is the best coach in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for wearing a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no races lost during the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to settle , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve .
we were very caught in the moment .
Helen called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Helen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the process , stay in the process &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it really is important to not get away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking for making some Tol@@ les .
we did not want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did .
the pair will take a break for one year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that could have too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ as .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
this feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of screening for clarity
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &quot; , R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öller , enters the retirement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small drinking water @-@ purpose combined as a model for the big water producers .
this way it was said some time ago in the Medi@@ alt@@ on &apos;s contribution to the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
little later , the water forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken damaged the purpose @-@ linked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is as a exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the two @-@ company associate , 28 years as managing director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ dorf group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of the Municipality of Kot@@ en@@ dorf , encourages about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
member states are the municipalities of Kirch@@ schlag@@ , Breit@@ brunn , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ah .
for further towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Ombud@@ sman in Ger@@ tru@@ d sta@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller 1985 was appointed as a water@@ jet and was appointed since 1988 as managing director of the two @-@ party association .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water conduc@@ tion and maintenance activities , bud@@ get@@ ary creation , calcul@@ ating fees and contributions to emergency operations at weekends , &quot; said the president .
as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ formation of a central computer control ( 1999 ) , the new@@ building of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the divisions of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still , and I have always recorded new additions because water is f@@ ute and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , they praised an@@ aes@@ ters , reliable and accurate service over the age of 31 .
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for its purpose @-@ purpose association , and he has lived for the purpose of the water @-@ purpose association than it would be its own company .
a few weeks ago , he allowed a true practitioner to present the success concept of the v@@ eit@@ es group to the nit@@ rates of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken District Forum in front of a few weeks .
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller s@@ well praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Grie@@ bel , who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as highlights from his point of view he drew the fountain structure and the turn@@ around of the two @-@ party association .
the biggest challenge and the hardest use were but the pel@@ let at the Hoch@@ hop@@ per at Church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
here at minus 17 degrees we had to work throughout the night , so that the villages with water could be supplied .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn at one time can only be maintained because one filled the container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with scr@@ ap@@ pers .
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who ki@@ cks the follow @-@ up of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has killed on Friday against 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) to his partner and they were fatal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called to us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly sp@@ un .
by now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , brown and has a lat@@ ze .
meanwhile the police published a picture of him .
it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a lat@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon in itself , so the police .
who sees Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police talks about an &quot; relationship of association . &quot;
the victim is year 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator 1981 .
the police in Lü@@ beck didn &apos;t want to make any information on the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between the perpetr@@ ator and the victim ; but it confirmed that a man was killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we are not saying &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said a police spokes@@ person in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the cryp@@ tic and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million@@ th .
financial stresses that thre@@ aten the industry from the cost of oil , are of the table .
it remains in the release of renewable energy sources in the matter @-@ so @-@ called self @-@ production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ end@@ Edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we were able to finally reach the tough negotiation after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission was first planned to use the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ ok@@ f to generate electricity for their own consumption , for the cas@@ hier .
the steel industry generated additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry association .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there are now a key@@ code with the European Commission for talks with the Commissioner Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works will be replaced , all an E@@ EG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on its own production .
by doing so , the status quo of the current regulation will be largely fixed .
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission standards , climate and employment targets are taken into account &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis in 2008 and has considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continues to increase as the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weak@@ ened domestic demand in the world market .
European manufacturers are throwing Chinese steel corporations rival @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation is somewhat relaxed .
for an over@@ hau@@ led import duties on imports and effect , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have opened up .
what is unclear how sustainable is the prize @-@ reco@@ vering .
the German industry leader Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp was careful on Thursday .
finally , the prices were again stag@@ nating again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Thys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp also wanted to exclude lock@@ ers of individual works .
in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 there were about 8@@ 6000 people .
in July the German steel producers remain cautious despite increasing prices and growing orders .
they produced about 3.4 million tons a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s previous year , as the economic association founded steel on Friday .
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to each other for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production rose by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an improved order with an increased output .
community , spirit , health : singing the elderly well
the singing has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp to her whole life : as Young girl she was in the school @-@ choir , in the school@@ ing @-@ studies it took the f@@ ach of music , and now the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sang in a sen@@ iors chor@@ us .
&quot; singing me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says .
at the same time , they are doing something good for her and her mind .
for singing is the same from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Erhard H@@ ac@@ ers says of the German sen@@ iors liga .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular merger , the sen@@ iors can establish and maintain social contacts .
we often solve social and family structures in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L g@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , writes H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors sen@@ iors a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand his lungs regularly , is not as fast as the pu@@ zz@@ ling in everyday life .
even if it is about getting the sound of voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in older people , S@@ ingen often have a very special effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ursula L@@ enz , said of the Federal Labour Organisation of the Sen@@ iors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in older generations the joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time .
L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing from songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth .
through Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and particularly melodies arise himself , the ill @-@ war@@ ts of people war@@ med down to a long backward events .
at the head , the head also requires a special performance , explained L@@ enz .
at the same time concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially elderly , who live alone , practicing not just concentrating on himself .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an avi@@ d audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
herself to show itself : if I am long for something , I will better get more vigil@@ ant about myself - this experience strengthens .
good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough .
who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent to have , av@@ enge L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t tell me alone - about 50 singing men , who doesn &apos;t hear when a tone goes next to it ?
looking for the right offer have sen@@ iors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
sings someone from the acquaint@@ ance in a senior ench@@ y@@ ma or can simply connect .
many cities also offer insights on cho@@ irs in the area .
those who want to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many senior par@@ ench@@ y@@ irs can also be found via the Internet .
anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask family , friends or neighbours to help with the inter@@ ne@@ go@@ che .
who like to sing , should not join a choir , betra@@ ys H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing the soul well and has something fre@@ eing - this is true for every age .
cats react sensitive as a han@@ go@@ ver on the cry of the young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hanover , the effect the herd of cat @-@ bab@@ ys has grown to adult animals .
to her surprise the Mi@@ wing even left the males not cold - however , they stopped in the difference to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kittens at the Mi@@ g of the Small .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens who found themselves in great need , as scientists have found out of the veterinary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
but K@@ ater also respond to the kittens of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ cks of less and strongly aroused bul@@ ls for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding said from the MH@@ H .
it is first authorized in the study published on this Friday in the magazin &quot; BM@@ C Evolution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch @-@ height of the kittens with the ur@@ gency of their help is distinguished .
a total of nine adult male and eight females have been studied from the shelter of the MH@@ H .
for a short run of babies , they were taken away from the throw box and separated from mother and si@@ blings for three minutes .
for the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger kit@@ ten , which were also lifted up high .
the researchers consider their results in spite of the low sample sample for sa@@ vi@@ ous .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , acted out on the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned more quickly to loud@@ speaker if this cat@@ cher has played the very sublime kit@@ ten .
this ability may be innate or developer with sex @-@ ripe .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have ever responded to , &quot; the Bi@@ olog@@ in said .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noises several times in the past .
also there are some studies that women re@@ acting on infants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes part with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , against the one @-@ ru@@ sty football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver was en@@ acted .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt in Turkey a major football match takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ie between visits to Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as well as &quot; is announced .
even at the suspension of the emergency , after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ hes are not com@@ promised .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who are responsible for the coup attempt .
it is not just done before football .
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r he placed his prosec@@ utor as a warran@@ t .
accordingly , in the meantime , the South of South America is being accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
South @-@ South should be adher@@ ents to the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup de President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan by the President Rec@@ ep Tayyip Erdogan .
while the first one is valid for 90 days , it still holds true for 90 days , in fact , that in fact , has the life of most Turks but as good as no effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of public places throughout the country Erdogan declared on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdogan .
especially fans of the club club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but faced with dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
that &apos;s even the fans agree - regardless of whether you are beating heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ cal@@ orie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is especially back on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his sporty value was demonstrated by the Köl@@ ner in the exp@@ ired season : with 17 gates and nine Templ@@ ates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old were his first season as a top scor@@ er of his organisation .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NAT@@ IK &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and backed his team to the tro@@ phy .
thanks to Pol@@ di &quot; the disappointing season for the record Master took an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion .
after the round @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; is also early in the Europe League .
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master visits the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who ended with 26 season figures as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ al@@ heads the base for the 14th title .
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the gi@@ fted Gom@@ ez had been announced at the AC Florence under contract and at visits to visits , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday not to return .
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; cited the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club@@ chief Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the falls should be ready to for@@ ego around a third of his to 7.5 million euros , it was clear that Or@@ man said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence cannot be paid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite of dop@@ ing : these athletes have medals and chances of Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa may not start in Rio .
others covered athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of dop@@ ing still determines the headlines with the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian ba@@ mmer@@ ed in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping sper@@ re their starting right shortly before the games , was filled with their start ( 100 meters chest ) filled and ble@@ bed .
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a big smile she was still ra@@ ged into the hall and prov@@ okes with her appearance .
as a proof that they won &apos;t get gold , the public broke out into a j@@ ubil@@ era .
but there are numerous other athletes , who go to the start despite dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here &apos;s an overview :
Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 @-@ 2010 ) .
since his ban the Olympi@@ asi@@ an from 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest challenge from U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and the seven @-@ time world championship in 2010 had to di@@ gest an six @-@ month lock after taking the pain by using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation you had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ asi@@ an of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and Europe has been positively tested on the ban of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ anol in 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic shot the same intake and was locked in six months .
the four widest lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the big Gold@@ fav@@ ors .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Peking @-@ Olympics and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , 2010 was positively tested and 21 months have been blocked .
a means to penis enlargement may have been responsible , guarded Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( He@@ aling , Belarus ) : probably hardly one athlete were subsequently sold so many medals .
so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been found testosterone she@@ oping with him .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to give Olympic @-@ silver 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he was also recognized as a medal from the Olympic Games in 2008 , due to a judgment of the CA@@ S International Tribunal .
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m , he is on the rank two of the world rankings .
Li@@ u Hong Kong , 20 km walking , China ) : the World War and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin has only been tested in May , but must still start in Rio .
during the 29 years old world championship in evidence we were found evidence of taking a wasted health supplement , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran off on 13 July .
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austria &apos;s in hurt - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is standing in contact with the woman , said the speaker at the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she has suffered cutting @-@ cutting and was treated in the hospital , but I can already leave this again .
I planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
whether from other explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ om@@ phe , are also still unclear .
the State Department stand in close contact with local authorities , so schn@@ apps .
around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok &apos;s Hua H@@ in was first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a half @-@ quarter two bombs .
according to the police , the police were killed and around 20 people were killed , among them the Austrian women , three Germans , three countries and three Italians .
Friday then again two spa@@ wn sets went up , and according to the authorities there was another human being killed .
even from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb has been en@@ rolled in the morning .
during deto@@ on@@ ation near the tourists popular Bad@@ estr@@ ands Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver has been injured .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , a further bomb that killed a municipal authorities .
the explo@@ sives was according to the authorities in a flower be@@ et in front of the prec@@ inct @-@ police force in the air .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in ch@@ om@@ phe on the southeast coast several wounded .
from a connection to the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ un@@ ate carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army General Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ y@@ h@@ ee pre@@ mat@@ urely prior to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably , however , it is about the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ate mus@@ li@@ des separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , however , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , which is restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok .
instead , it is assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling jun@@ ta .
the authorities have received secret critics concerning the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they have not been informed about the exact time and places .
still unclear , which group behind the attacks .
police rejected its officials throughout the country to strengthen security around major government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bombs , but mostly they are not opposed to tourists .
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bomb versions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry is recommended for its homepage to make the instructions of the Thai safety authorities as a result .
high safety risks ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ ola and surroundings .
according to disputes between security guards and Muslim population , do not take all necessary journeys to these provinces .
increased safety risks ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were taken only a few days after a controversial referendum on one by the jun@@ ta &apos;s military jun@@ ta .
the military will have great influence over the coming years even over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said that bombs were an attempt to sti@@ el chaos while the country moving towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , keeps itself too good to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not been able to get a handle from the military rebels since years in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok the attack on a popular Hind@@ u @-@ Sch@@ wa@@ 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several state offices also the Constitutional Treaty provided the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular Movement &apos; Con@@ clu@@ es for aspirations against the Freedom Democratic Party Order , &quot; said Constitutional prot@@ esters Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press @-@ Agentur in Berlin .
thus , the im@@ migrant Islamic faith or from the Middle East are attacked in the extrem@@ ist way .
that is why we are monitoring the movement well .
the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 .
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; controlled mass immigration , &quot; and &quot; loss of its own identity by tran@@ gement . &quot;
constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , N@@ RW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said his authority was closely coordinated with the state authority during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ary Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to get their target audience , where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generally speaking extremis@@ ts , speaking them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not num@@ b advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda should respond to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
finally , from several federal states there had been reports about contacts of the &quot; I@@ den@@ tit@@ ular &quot; to Af@@ for@@ es politicians .
Ma@@ ate said , he did not have knowledge .
for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind will be relevant only at some point .
it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ ales - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist to change their goal and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
decisive is that such people have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view of the marked increase of lawful criminal offen@@ ders and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps said Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new Right terrorism in this context .
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
it can be quite well that further right @-@ wing group@@ ings or small groups form to plan the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other extreme @-@ right motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a German @-@ wide or pan @-@ wide control of legal frozen should not be recognis@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the previous groups were written on the regional level or in social networks .
concerned , Ma@@ ate was talking about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who were not in the right scene first .
this is the worrying .
many of the counter @-@ demon@@ ic attacks on asylum seekers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated or adher@@ ents to the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes committed previously with right wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who however have been radical in favour of extreme @-@ right mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is becoming the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the detail was chosen .
in social networks he then became the vir@@ gin@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a back of 48 seconds its pr@@ its and ranked the 5@@ 9th position of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not a sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start @-@ to @-@ start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ cut countries known .
since in Ethiopia , most sports men wanted to walk , I wanted to do something else .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname of the Round took the lap .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media signed it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of whale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ ids leaf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about him funny . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , playing no part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; comparisons with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were also drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run between Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention was paid .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool made of Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in a tra@@ y over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle alone .
fren@@ e@@ tically , m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was stopped at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learnt only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ ple@@ ting voting system not so tight
the Republi@@ can Presidential Office . Donald Tr@@ ump speaks on an election event in Florida .
should it be nothing with the choice of US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative .
he will then drive into the holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be no surprise : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end it won &apos;t be a very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV broadcast@@ er CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if for him it would not be rich in the end for reasons of political correctness , it is ok , said Tr@@ ump .
thus he called the US President Barack Obama and the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia ( IS ) .
within his party the last more and more resistance was formed .

the interests of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post office plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oters .
the Group will soon want to start the trade with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer their electric transpor@@ ter from the next year on the free engine market .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday .
the company has been checking out whether they developed their own Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and bags , also to sell to other farms .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news of the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon get into the mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ own production , the company has the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des announced that the Group wants to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long run a complete change to the environment @-@ friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in late July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we can change the entire fleet .

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ leadership continues after dis@@ closing business figures
the consumer @-@ based company Gf@@ K sw@@ aps his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ig@@ nations suddenly arrived - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research @-@ business Gf@@ K agreed that the chair of Board of Directors Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the un@@ secure , the longer the success has promised .
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg @-@ based company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ appoint business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company &apos;s leadership is the global number five of the industry before a personalized re@@ beginning .
G@@ FR@@ P @-@ Executive Board wants to leave the company to the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert has already been dra@@ ined with effect on September 12 out of the board body .
as for September 1 , the management member states over already taking the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , divided the company with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; board &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a replacement for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the retri@@ bution , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ person on Friday .
who will be le@@ verage the market research business in the future is still unclear .
on the contrary , it was on Friday , during the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring had been managed by years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of the restructuring is still not to be seen after 5 years &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the last bad Gf@@ K transaction tax , each of the partial land@@ owners will eventually be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it meant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company had not stopped its losses in the quarter quarter in the second quarter of 2016 .
36@@ 1.2 million euros , the turnover amoun@@ ted to 6.@@ 1 per cent below the same level of the previous year .
in relation to the first half of the year , sales with 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros decreased by 3.4 per cent .
earnings in the second quarter , above all , the fiscal value of the company has been stra@@ ined in the face of its difficult economic situation .
in the Consumer Experience division , the company &apos;s business value is needed from 139 million Euros to the Group under the line , a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros .
in the second quarter of 2015 the Gf@@ K had still generated a Group &apos;s profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in cro@@ oked in dit@@ ch : eight Ver@@ last
with an accident of a travel agency with 43 sen@@ iors as the drivers &apos; guests , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kar@@ pac@@ a ( County Aur@@ i ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , shared the police with them .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the bus company from Eisen@@ ach had to differ according to their data according to a counter@@ part , which was partly focused on the road car .
the bus came right from the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , like a speaker in the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire@@ fighters liber@@ ated the in@@ mates .
six ambul@@ ances and an ac@@ qui@@ ties came to the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back by a liner bus to the Kar@@ pac@@ z district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the truck and possible witness to sign up in the police .
the fees per cu@@ bic meters waste water will be from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / World War 3.@@ 44 instead of 2,@@ 10 euro ; for Zul@@ tenberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to 2,@@ 26 Euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to 2,@@ 18 euros ) .
at the hotel in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will be further increased later , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary .
after a s@@ layer calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will be at 4,@@ 37 Euro per cu@@ bic meters .
as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , was established with the approval of the budget by the land department Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for these se@@ wage systems run @-@ covers .
the Kas@@ endorf market is committed due to its legal foundation , the facilities cost @-@ over@@ l@@ ingly .
from 1 October 2016 the citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ tenberg will have to reach deeper into the po@@ cket@@ book .
the stir@@ rings are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Chairman of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt presented the Panel , a re @-@ calculation of fees for se@@ wage systems of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 there are also over@@ - and sub @-@ covers from the previous cut @-@ up period .
the grace@@ ful g@@ ag@@ it@@ ches founded Schmidt in order that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage systems with a very low wast@@ e@@ water emergency , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year .
in this way , due to the small distribution base , for example , for the repairs of several thousand Euros would have a impact .
moreover , the se@@ wage treatment in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining .
furthermore , in the backward calculation period at all three plants , not least because of their age of san@@ itation and repair expendi@@ tures in a significant extent .
the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ tenberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt referred to that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ ores had to be exchanged due to a damage caused by damage .
in the Pump@@ werk World War II , the nearly 20 years old conve@@ ying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led , and after nearly 20 years of operation of the first clearance system , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge de@@ duct and an additional ventilation system will be able to keep the water @-@ legal requirements also in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expendi@@ tures came to consider the advanced tut@@ or and maintenance costs involved in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still significantly below the present level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made clear that in the low wast@@ e@@ water in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully beat &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thereby , added Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the se@@ wage systems have remained spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the situation for the aforementioned plants will remain prec@@ arious from stone houses on the duration of the period , especially since one could not extend the supply of the se@@ wage association of Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these installations , since it is concerned with de@@ frau@@ dul@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average of stag@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
the CP@@ I in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1,@@ 7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6,@@ 3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
the prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) .
the rates remained like in advance at alcoholic beverages and tobacco , apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian caricature
sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e but some observers say that it is uns@@ ha@@ bel against races .
with its filter tool , it allows sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users who change reality and play identities through such a way that already borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de .
you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ blo@@ omed , especi@@ al tools that produce more than 30 million improved sel@@ enium per day .
all de@@ tours arrive to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters in the past critic@@ ises that they were accused of making use of Black@@ magic , or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week some U@@ sers sl@@ apped a filter which gave them s@@ lit , false teeth and inv@@ aded W@@ angen , some critics called a rac@@ ist caricature of Asi@@ aten - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yel@@ lowing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they asked if these repeti@@ tive controversy sur@@ passed on a greater problem that the company with diversity has .
the news and the indign@@ ation were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat communic@@ ates that it would have the feature de@@ activated .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be a homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as cartoon by Asi@@ ads .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ is@@ m@@ atism , rec@@ alled the filter at vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et was widely used about the photos that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and mild to say . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the opposite of a very severe Asian caricature and the filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ sighted , but that the terrain was deduc@@ ted into the extreme extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural Stol@@ per@@ wire .
the American culture appears to be involved in an endless poem and integration process , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in hand .
and sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who di@@ ver in the bel@@ ong@@ ings of race as their older counterparts - could be more likely to assume sen@@ sibility .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters would create an image that is ins@@ ul@@ ting for a user , &quot; so it is much more difficult , that such things remain un@@ noticed as it was earlier the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided that as a product manager and engineer , she decided to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , asking others to do the same .
in an assignment for medium and in a telephone interview she told that they reflect a lack of diversity among Sn@@ ap@@ chat practices .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours who work there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say about what to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat , largely un@@ answered .
the Company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , there was Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a speech , the company has recently focused on a personnel responsible , which presented itself on sub@@ trac@@ ted population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not OK . &quot;
military @-@ fal@@ si@@ fied ISIS intelligence information , the Committee of Congress
military members of the United States Central Command changed information to draw an optimum picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when it would allow the actual conditions on site announced an investigation committee of the congress in a report on Thursday .
the provisional report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces , Intelligence @-@ Com@@ promis@@ ers and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ kom@@ mit@@ es , reported of great dis@@ content among Central Command secret services , reported how pre @-@ continued its in@@ estim@@ ations to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed .
the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military deployment in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news services , which were typically in@@ geni@@ ous from high @-@ level Cent@@ com Kom@@ man@@ ders , frequently signed a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than it allows the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; said a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses our political leaders will be presented &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives , fixed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ com range up to the top peak of the organisation .
the ten @-@ side report shows more detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces .
although there is no direct indications of it that government leaders have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts saw the pressure from their predecessors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as ISIS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half year 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the Congress were significantly more positive than the facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presented the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com arri@@ vals was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tops of Central Command changed the rec@@ tion@@ able reports to play the danger of ISIS in Iraq .
the Re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday is completed even through detailed findings and will be continued during investigations .
additionally , further investigations of Cent@@ com reports are underway by the Ministry of Defence in Kosovo .
democratic Members of the Intelligence Services Party published on Thursday their own findings , which agree with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of shipping services to IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; there was our stran@@ gely democr@@ at in the kom@@ mit@@ one , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of publication reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed the morality of analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave a little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. ship and Democrats gave to no evidence to have found evidence of the White House at the Cent@@ com analy@@ st in terms of a &quot; determined political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August the New York Times reported by the secretary of the Pentagon , which were recorded by Cent@@ com analysts after complaints from Cent@@ com .
marriage . Patrick Evans , a press secretary of the Pentagon , announced in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress while the investigations of the general spec@@ tor were still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have thoroughly diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcomed a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defense . &quot;
the investigations have gone beyond the question of a successful aviation campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a statement which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest expressions of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crises areas .
the criticism of the secret statements about the Islamic State remembering the isti@@ ce of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writer conducted by George W. Bush contrary to the recommendations of many analysts just looked forward to a small occupying forces in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker has also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to identify government officials that would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these provisional refin@@ eries could have been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
yet , this knowledge was not published , the Times in September reported .
Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s commander @-@ owner , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature for its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retirement in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain .
a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans were won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
however , that knows , however , the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain un@@ defeated .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which both of the two teams will gain each of the first and second place within their group .
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer out of the course of the strong ri@@ vals , which lead the other group .
as always the game likes to go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after having spent the past London games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sle@@ ger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a national champion of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus the things began to become better .
&quot; a culture change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the Ru@@ der completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a set@@ back from the Middle East .
India was gone to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the play rate from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she did a Sprint with the flat ball on the left side , then moved to the middle and swal@@ lowed the ball into the gate around the Americans to achieve a 2 @-@ 0 leadership .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last district .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how well will hin@@ ge the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen des Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are developing and inevitable , a rapid stag@@ gering between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rate , which is handed over from the wr@@ ist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour in the queue in the coffee shop , without any Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ v or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there are Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time during the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s throw @-@ warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could quite well have been sent among those known names that were sent to the Prime Time , build by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even Fe@@ b .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold .
the Olympic Fl@@ ame is not lit every event .
further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports , which are not generally recognized : air@@ brush shooting , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the thor@@ ax and may it reign for a long time .
but if I should humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has already been a Olympic event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , it was the last 16 years so spar@@ se that many that I asked , did not know that there is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent to competition , there has never won a medal in the trampoline , and until 2012 has had an athlete who made it to the final .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for sharing the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
jumping on a trampoline has a certain exter@@ i@@ iter@@ char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ resolved ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school as those for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should confess that I am not an expert , but only an un@@ ai@@ ded enthusi@@ ast .
it has hum@@ orous potential - the car@@ n@@ otic trem@@ bling of his never ending clouds - but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and num@@ b that combines two sports that is essentially united .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from Spanish El tramp@@ ol@@ ines , which means as much as the spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
asp@@ iring winners on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , he@@ ave and sal@@ es@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympi@@ as , they are assessed according to execution , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ abundant athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing against each other in Rio .
the common Olympic vector is straight on .
med@@ all@@ ers need to continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and dr@@ via , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , up and down on the playground .
they are not only hunting the zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the wall unit , but in the TV transfer also another height goal : that of the World or the Olympi@@ are@@ cor@@ ds .
the targeted aspir@@ ation is pos@@ h , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator with tears .
but it is also what I think even when looking at these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
of this the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is top .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she j@@ all@@ u@@ t , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then effortlessly back upwards , then effortlessly back upwards .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during practice there is no hectic attack on the goal , no v@@ ault in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is just as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympic Games .
the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ yers of Women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will shine as part of an afternoon @-@ bloc to both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anxiety and the obj@@ ectivity of the athlete , as the Male U.S. Tur@@ ner recently ki@@ cked off - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his following air rin@@ ks , New Fan@@ als .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , long ago an ally of the USA
violent protest protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , to the violent resistance of the government .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia straight to break up with it ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months the protests against the government are broken up in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the response of the government was according to human rights organisations un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses were given that polic@@ emen were killed in un@@ armed demonstrators and killed .
in the run @-@ up videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , how to strike young people with sticks while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN authority for human rights now demands a detailed investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold up this country and will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous land of Africa and its stability is appreciated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiop@@ ian economy was expanding in the remarkable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents effective to silence .
many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the wilderness .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from ground use up to the throws in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
after a further critical choice last year , the ruling party and its allies got the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time , the tensions rise along the border with Eritrea ; a struggle for this pron@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating Front , or the National Liber@@ ation Front des O@@ ga@@ den , which in recent years become more or less forced to use turmoil and be ar@@ ming again .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ing after years of the before turning out into the surface .
the first seems to be harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years have been very Ethiop@@ ians in a position to communicate with the social media as cheaper smartphones were becoming more frequent and improved the internet services .
even when the government lacks access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially at protests , do many people still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they are staying .
several young Ethiop@@ ians have announced that they gathered so to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of prosp@@ eri@@ as , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia , mostly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they are the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and living in low@@ lands .
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos .
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which constitute approximately 6 percent of the population , and which are dominant in the military , in the secret services and politics .
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was after his death on a un@@ sealed illness in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister .
he was regarded as tactical genius , a man who could think of corners .
analysts say he was particularly mistaken in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special officers to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict @-@ analy@@ st .
Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ attended reasons to assume the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Albania , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south .
analy@@ st saying that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray controlled .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia lived such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands against elections were prot@@ esting , who were apparently fu@@ elled by the government according to analyses , and subsequently were stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even though it was less than in the last months and this time of distur@@ ban@@ ces were relatively quickly over .
development experts praised leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for measurable progress in the fight against poverty .
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ g@@ ist in the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ aic city , from Tig@@ ray brought operations to and the hatred towards the tiger ray is always practiced in the social media .
analysts say that the protests the US and other Western allies are in a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for d@@ ron@@ ing flights about the neighboring Somalia , even though they recently en@@ vy that she concluded that basis .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want to collapse its allies in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin grass @-@ hike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has been founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy on Friday that surround his campaign by giving his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton had been the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fying new questions posed to the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republi@@ can public@@ ans whether he is able to communicate clearly and understand the American public .
it also brings to his co @-@ ordin@@ ates who will try to take him during an event@@ ful phase in order to explain in the peculiar position , statements that he could not do at all .
having made the hint at an election event on Wednesday evening , ru@@ ined Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS .
but on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic .
the T@@ we@@ et was contrary to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely seriously .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ o@@ der@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ witt Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to weak@@ en the statement that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS .
the last storm of the critic@@ isms pr@@ as@@ sel@@ t down to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign due to the case of case @-@ looking de@@ aler@@ ts to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return again to this issue .
referring to Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
at the end of July he had strong criticism of himself , as he said the Russians were to bake Mrs. Clin@@ ics E@@ mails , but he explained later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then adjust to the need .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages from his fans are invited , how they arrive , and then possibly to clarify &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I think he is clever enough to v@@ ise his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they may be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has still accepted an additional sound , since its question@@ ing has gone further .
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with great lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to ap@@ olog@@ ise for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort its statements or to understand his sense of humour .
but while he is more focuss@@ ed in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ ordin@@ ates into the in@@ convenient situation to him stand independently of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements seem to be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giu@@ li@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the world &apos;s most prominent c@@ essors , showed great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giu@@ li@@ ani , he said to the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements was asked if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State .
in this sense , it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them bot@@ t@@ aries , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq .
the majority of mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outside Minister , there is ISIS allowed to spread out by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and bow@@ ed them to ride in any of his words and be taken up against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he increases the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats spot@@ ted with Mr. Tr@@ umps and only one further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once pushed across the market from the market , cafe in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ by café in Williamsburg , in which you could pay only cash , that no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years in good coffee .
naturally , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front was pushed out of course .
the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals sad@@ dened it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ing wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is changing , but I still cannot believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ t and Ver@@ b now is a soap @-@ shop . &quot;
but if New York change is , then it is also new .
a re@@ vit@@ rec@@ ant cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the publisher is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing staff of the old cafe , the owner and the manager of the new café .
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same Distri@@ but@@ or for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are yar@@ ns such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are nature bow@@ ls .
the cafe serves no beer more , for this there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a steady stream on old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been squee@@ zed by awards from Williamsburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rebecca Oli@@ vei@@ ra was one of such customer .
Oli@@ vei@@ ra , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly .
even after having moved to Green@@ point , it would take the way up .
after the verb had closed , they gave a while the coffee sink down , she said .
&quot; it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; she said .
now she drinks her again coffee , even if she ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ s a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and tru@@ thful customer since the beginning of the verb .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably the same thing .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket . and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said .
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and put new ingredients into the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no res@@ ent@@ ant over that the soap @-@ business took up the old business room .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie were offered , a special soap for cra@@ b with the cold coffee of coffee as an ingredient .
&quot; I think we will go to their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez .
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Poland and Rodri@@ guez said that he predicted to place them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ ana wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the cafe expands upon a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb takes place to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a customer , and said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that a new coffee felt like a home@@ coming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to sm@@ elling that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an abundant meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension as president , Fran@@ klin DE@@ L@@ AN@@ O Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as an enemy , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
its menu on this day was a little more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ree and as dessert a pa@@ men@@ pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Zie@@ gel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights , and there are both food histori@@ a. .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zie@@ gel@@ man tells in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential home at the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
its latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ou@@ tra@@ geous snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash crash 1929 .
goat , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ eses made with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixing .
when re@@ porter was ordered , this was the pair of discussion on food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was pe@@ n@@ uss@@ bread , liver cheese and sav@@ ory bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheap , which stretched the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
co@@ de@@ gr@@ in .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach like Ble@@ i , &quot; he said .
in the years ahead of Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ buffet .
teams of women co@@ sities for male organ workers and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands out the ways in which the country turned to be no more of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wor@@ lied Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as tense was the new budget dishes : mysterious food like loaves and water @-@ specimen were found to stap@@ le food , the water @-@ remains reconstructed , &quot; noted brick , because chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a mu@@ ddy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rare @-@ fourth luxury .
peculiar mix@@ tures have been tried , as a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutrient @-@ rich satisfaction had priority before taste or even healthy kitchen .
during her research for the book , which includes also recipes , set to be a dish from this era , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zie@@ gel@@ mann goes further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not suitable to each other .
it was typical for many of the household &apos;s recipes .
as never before or since , household economics - among them Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 , the eating habits of the country is good .
by publishing the recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ as , like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a festival of historic ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports about the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ eating @-@ attitude .
while he made public the simple I@@ owa residen@@ ces in his kitchen he spec@@ ist like the millions of millions of world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e .
he ate in an almost con@@ gol@@ ous dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ king .
he was really more realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ anor had called him to stat@@ u@@ ate his stomach with his stomach .
as described in the book , the recru@@ it of a house@@ keeper had no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was rejected , once the country got back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zie@@ gel@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said how science was applied to food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pair passed when writing the book the eating habits of Zie@@ gel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law was better understood - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Zie@@ gel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ le case .
after the plates were cleared away at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s board , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had dressed in at home : the pl@@ ums , the president Roo@@ sev@@ elt took lunch .
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zie@@ gel@@ man and added that it was a common trick , humble recep@@ tions an send name to miss .
there was no wel@@ ded cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone emerged somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon into the tough , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e brought three times a supplement .
how a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ fier he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
with bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo , Khal@@ ed Omar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old itself died at a facade attack of the Assad regime .
Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group , which brought life up to almost 6@@ 0.000 people so far .
2@@ 900 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives to play in order to pull people out of bom@@ bed homes and to afford the first aid in the war @-@ field .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil tank , which shows him during a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a su@@ prem@@ acy of a house , went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians to the shining symbolic character in the atro@@ city of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as heroes he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am dying to save life I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before Omar was a victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicopter @-@ kop@@ ter have rejected four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from respiratory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now breaking the poison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the picture cited its last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest vor@@ tex is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland usually only occur in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board ship .
he was born 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland will only get after 150 years of experience .
the most common swi@@ ms of the Greenland was on the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is an average of 1,@@ 220 meters long .
only when it arrives , the five meters long animal speeds on s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this maximum speed .
this lifestyle @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a pan@@ acea for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least from Greenland , who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; madness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life @-@ span , which signi@@ fies a world record for verteb@@ rates .
the affir@@ med of the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already for a long time that Greenland will become rocky .
only l@@ acked the evidence .
Greenland are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the polar sea before the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees cel@@ sius , they usually dive on the surface only during the winter .
researchers know about the lifestyle of Greenland researchers accordingly .
their time @-@ ser@@ pent@@ ine measures they , as they were planted in front of S@@ val@@ bard six animals with one transm@@ itter .
loot also make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another , had swal@@ lowed the jaw @-@ bones of a young ice @-@ bear .
possibly , they hunt for sleeping animals or pat@@ rou@@ illi@@ ers on the ground of the ice @-@ me@@ tering and look car@@ c@@ asses , that from higher water layers down down@@ corners .
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a subsi@@ dy from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ etres long while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ timeter measurement .
to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method the lin@@ ens of shar@@ ks .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it later no longer be renewed .
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the len@@ tic@@ ular .
their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as a nuclear weapons trying to drag bigger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon off into the atmosphere .
in the very smallest animal in the course of 220 cen@@ tim@@ etres the third @-@ smallest animal contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during his investigation in 2012 .
all major Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their l@@ itter on the other hand , created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 centimeters long in Greenland . at the age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters even 3@@ 92 years old may be .
that the Greenland female would only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers have been able to arrange an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters is probably on the br@@ ink of sex and its age was determined with 15@@ 6 years , Greenland with the multip@@ lication was obviously at least one and a half centuries .
also this is likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ er@@ eme live mainly in e@@ isi@@ es waters is no coincidence .
also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland , in its bac@@ on on the neck a 120 year old Har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures it is often running the organism that live there on savings .
so you are lucky - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal heat heating up .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than in a gram@@ ophone elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is thus living dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as early as possible , &quot; the evolution@@ s@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein .
one very large animal should rather invest their resources in a long life .
back@@ ground@@ ing in double pack
with topics around the building , the community at the latest meeting has focused on a focal point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the relief the committee took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of the recently documented dwell@@ ings can start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ ing and ground@@ ing surveys have been clarified and the applications could be provided in the residential areas &quot; street l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße ) and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) to prospective buyers nothing more in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the be@@ g in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and with its sen@@ iors equally appeal .
as it meant , bau@@ bles can immediately sign up in the Town Hall to discuss the allocation of the plots is expected to advise the Joint Council in its September meeting .
in order to also obtain questions about the settlement of other commercial companies , associated with the creation of jobs , will be adjusted , the council decided to re @-@ change the area @-@ advantage plan within the spring of this year .
in the area of Unter@@ tim@@ lar@@ n , there is already a designated commercial area in the area around two plots on the road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
the City of Main has therefore attended the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg to attract the best opportunities for London to reloc@@ ated jobs and companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very probable that Frankfurt has benefited most from the Bre@@ xit vote &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Bre@@ xit referendum it is uncertain whether money @-@ houses are continuing to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have thus far from approval in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is just using large US banks .
several banks have already announced , to transfer jobs .
the lob@@ bying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; reck@@ oned with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main R@@ ange 5 years .
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important governmental authorities such as the European insurance view of the IO@@ PA and the EP@@ R@@ B &apos;s risk .
in Paris , the organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the not@@ en@@ bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
in Luxembourg a large fund sector , but also like Dublin at the infrastructure will be worse off .
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
further points are the city with easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the rents for first class properties are also 50 per cent higher than the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crime .
in a ranking of corporate consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stood at Square seven , Luxembourg in 2nd place 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Per@@ ry the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but London will be the most important financial center in Europe despite Bre@@ xit &apos;s most important financial center in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this also the forces of forces : in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 , we worked around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. government decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to a refund of the legal costs , which were created from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C jurisdictions with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was liber@@ ated of a claim payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ drugs So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge formed a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other non @-@ ethical actions .
upon survey the law@@ suit made on Thursday , US official in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead are entitled to decree the cost that arose during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to pull Gilead to heal the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients suffering from liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck got each other def@@ endants and ownership of laboratories , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir zu@@ ff@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead .

Clin@@ ics deserve 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal control
Hill@@ ary Clinton released their tax return for 2015 on Friday to mark the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective German tax rate of 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % .
in 2015 , the Clin@@ ics USD 1 Million for charitable purposes ended , primarily to the Clinton Foundation ; the former President Bill Clinton generated an income of USD 3 million by the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the State Department .
Clin@@ ics &apos;s candidate for the Vice President , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax deals in the last ten years .
they paid an effective Federal @-@ tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ ics fighting Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was in an opinion known . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a cr@@ ashes , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false interpre@@ tations and recall in relation to his present promises to publish its tax rates .
it is common for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax responses , although it is not oblig@@ ated by law because of this .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his attor@@ neys have indicated a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for his ref@@ usal .
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics &apos;s election campaign in Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate .
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he would not permit Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not complete .
Tr@@ umps critic , among other things also the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate at the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already been vo@@ ci@@ ble that his ref@@ usal questions in relation to wealth , its funds for charitable organisations , its business units and various other compounds e@@ jects , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown himself on the subject and published on Friday a video on the Internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Republi@@ can to publish their tax return .
on Thursday she was talking about the topic also in Michigan during a speech in Michigan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refused to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last few decades and to publish its tax affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid any or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a series of tax evasion and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case .
taxes have become a subject in an election campaign .
Clinton is named a regime that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett to ensure that people pay the more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire Hath@@ or industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tr@@ ump a meeting in order to share their tax deals .
Buff@@ ett said , he was also subjected to a control examination of IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump is &quot; afraid &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ ics campaign has returned a tax return to 2007 .
the Clin@@ ics , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , has an effective Federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the claim of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wage @-@ wage , unlike most of the Americans .
its main money system was a cost @-@ effective index funds , from which the Clin@@ ics dividen@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 had been controlled .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works , promote dancing @-@ bal@@ ani@@ as elephant
wildlife in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from dwelling in men inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years ago , trained along with the US @-@ conservation efforts by volunteers in villages in northern Tanz@@ an@@ as , to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and harvest without inf@@ ring@@ ing animals .
previously , many speakers have used to defend themselves .
Friday is a day &apos;s day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we &apos;ve developed the ... tool@@ kit we were able to observe within these communities that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants in doing so , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include the light of the eleph@@ ants with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles into a horn .
if he is not de@@ ported , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown off .
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with Earth together with a fire@@ works pass in a con@@ dom , whose end is shot up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion .
when it is ign@@ ited , the con@@ dom burst with a kno@@ b and sprin@@ kled fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der into the air .
a touch is usually already out to chase the eleph@@ ants .
a last possibility is a laun@@ cher which sho@@ ots a gol@@ dre@@ ary fire in the air and caused a loud , light explosion .
Stad@@ el@@ ude unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ os@@ k@@ re@@ building at the St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
normally , the St. Go@@ ar investment projects are taking part in the tra@@ des@@ people with Kus@@ sh@@ and - especially the retail centre is regarded as distinc@@ tly develop@@ able .
however , the application for the new construction of a sales ski@@ ski@@ ks am Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s construction still declined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in exp@@ on@@ able location on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk did not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director , defeats Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin had not listed any Israeli pres@@ election , as the Arab guest had requested so lou@@ dly for an employee . &quot;
Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country selection list .
however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room .
how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel about its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
the answer he got there , &quot; shock him , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel proposed that the measure is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason that stood behind it , dissolved in the director even more anger .
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they requested that the pres@@ election will be er@@ ased , &quot; the pres@@ et of Lan@@ z@@ mann was cited .
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were captiv@@ ated and troubled by this event .
this is really very embarrassing .
the fact that this has been worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the Hotel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident dissolved a fairly large resonance in the internet where people called the whole sc@@ andal .
some under@@ went to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged claims of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was mentioned in another post , in which it pointed out that the hotel , located at the most pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident a &quot; see &quot; and &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; by Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Israel should not include in the short @-@ term list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code was now added .

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade @-@ sum between Moscow and Teheran in the year equ@@ ated by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent .
since international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest on the Russian companies in shops in the country grew strongly , the Ambassador dealt with .
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade agreements is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade fair between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 was increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 to increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports went to Iran around 9@@ 1.5 percent and contributed $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade @-@ swing was achieved by deliveries of machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes off for this year by a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year the Russian foreign deployment gave around 3@@ 5.000 vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries that concerns the tourist number in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something of which the Ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend the visit of the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said .

from Hor@@ b it was driven by train to the starting point Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster of Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s loved wife is standing and so the pilgrimage route was stopped by the Münster .
the single daily tours were ham@@ pered in the morning and in the evening , depending on a brief impulse with various prayers , songs and writing .

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hed to home as Br@@ ite gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner rac@@ ed last evening at the Men &apos;s Sprint in Rio to glory , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow , took the ceramic role , who had made his land@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend proud when he rus@@ hed to home to get a win from the favor@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y brought the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
they repeated the trick , after they reached the railway world Championships in London in spite of the retreat Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the staff Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys retired , created a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the wi@@ pe that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - those four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner stayed in the qualification round a Olympi@@ are@@ ch@@ ord , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ ps victorious in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
subsequent to his lap was almost back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner thought it .
a strategic change made a great deal of transformation that was driving in a higher course to slow down and make it slow and above all Sk@@ inner to hold the pace .
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when this came up on the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year sc@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put up a Olympi@@ are@@ ch@@ ord in the ends and defeated the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , there was Hin@@ der that he fell on the train after a weak start .
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Rival .
with such a victory victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last three months we have joined together as a team .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if the bar@@ ometer of our progress has been in the last five months , we expect a successful five days at the velo@@ drome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the form of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenn@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it in the field of Pos@@ sible that he &apos;s victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest repeated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently sacred date for British sports ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal .
the boxes of the Ho@@ y immediately .
Kenn@@ y takes part next to the spr@@ int who starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lon@@ es@@ ome to gain alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal contest of the day but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll Quali@@ fied with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four o@@ dom@@ eter race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 on the destination .
the world record , which won in London gold was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where Wig@@ gins will be in focus on the second day of the competition .
he had disputed himself yesterday with respon@@ dents in front of the qualification as he called for him to measure his height .
in the course of the women &apos;s competition , which continues tomorrow and ended , Laura Des@@ p@@ t , Jo@@ anna Row@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie archive soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world volume time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 .
the GB team leaves itself on its strong rail cycle team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a crowd of medals .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were driven down .
Dr@@ amas played on the background so the res@@ ignation of the technical Leit@@ ers Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and Mob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ es and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like that &apos;s legendary reputation G@@ b@@ S , who has reached the perfect moment its climax , be repeated again .
future of the melting of Portland due to the abolition of energy consumption
the future of aluminium sm@@ el@@ mel@@ ted of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake as the plant operators announce the energy supply agreement , and thus will lift all the delivery contracts , as the supplier to supply energy companies .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one for 20 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sub@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will run in November . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered when closing .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting shop around 10 percent of total electricity Vic@@ tori@@ as consum@@ es .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point of Henry melt , which led to the closing of the Fis@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and risky a closure .
this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong austr@@ al dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which delivers the great aluminum mel@@ tdown with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina where the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p .
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate , which means more physical demand for electricity through the melting shop , &quot; shared the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continues to say that the contracts called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure businesses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were to come into force from November 2016 onwards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period deadline , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; so AG@@ L assumes that the contracts are contributing to the revenues in fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the power supply .
all potential impact on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the progn@@ oses of strong termin@@ us markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L share with that the value of the Tre@@ aties were already written in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the &quot; expectation of cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the treaties , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting shop or to ensure the power supply to the melting shop &quot; not com@@ promised .
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have come into force from November this year , even though an explanation is guilty of why it was res@@ igned by the contract .
analy@@ st about the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
in reference to the statements made by analysts at the beginning of the week , head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland , some 600 me@@ gawat@@ ts and Tom@@ ago consume around 900 me@@ gawat@@ ts of electricity .
should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and for us as generating sets , this would not be good , &quot; he said .
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ out of Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ners , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted sep@@ t@@ ember the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agram account .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this Co@@ vers brought me to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all .
the unvei@@ ling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , embro@@ i@@ fied Reality Video , which ends the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem of Rob and Ca@@ it@@ lyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z on@@ un@@ cle and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and that end with a classical turn : you have all planned a surprise party .
this is the cl@@ ad @-@ looking plot of almost every birthday sep@@ t@@ ler ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You were told that we had forgotten you ? &quot; with the honesty of a drawing room on a broadcast@@ er at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate her other girls somehow to this publicity .
with regard to the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th of Vo@@ gue , there is certainly a new era for car@@ c@@ hi@@ kers .
K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes it , as for the Vo@@ gue cover , have beaten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) but the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th of the magazine is one league for itself .
the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ th is for Vo@@ gue most of the most recent issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference , which resembles rather a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) , from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove ( 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the unvei@@ ling of his cover stars is expected , that over the last two years pictures of the magazine can still ob@@ ased out prior to the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the mod@@ ells &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the celebrities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar @-@ Pre@@ istr@@ ate and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even at the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passage model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celebrities are not related to the famous person@@ ages or Reality stars or young people from today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ners ) .
you are really talented women who are distinguished in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course , Jen@@ ners don &apos;t like success every one .
with its reality @-@ TV @-@ history , Jen@@ ners was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June he critici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ners and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the mist@@ ress of the moment . &quot;
these feelings clean@@ ses again , when the message came out with the appearance of Jen@@ ners on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut he seems to ride out at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ out of Vo@@ gue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
it is running for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she was sold by her paintings by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the journal .
and in her free time she is seen in the Reality . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
common areas centres annually 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the countries of the land are rejected annually by the community centers , while the industry is due to the impact of further intermediate cuts in already un@@ loaded transactions .
in Queensland , three out of five persons - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - for their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly under@@ mined , are ready for further cuts .
from June next year , these legal centers will be given further 30 percent of its funding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that the last survey of the National Association of Con@@ feder@@ ations centres revealed that thousands of people are rejected each year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse without lifting the German government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conqu@@ ering communities centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave non @-@ violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ prising and overwhelming debt , families , who were released by separ@@ ations , workers , the un@@ just dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get the help they need .
the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
we call on the Federal Ministry of federal law and federal judicial minister , as well as the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis in order to raise this mi@@ ddle@@ ware immediately so that people can get the help they need for legal problems .
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customer communities , as well as the government Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused by employees said to be a weapon
new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been indicted for alleged in@@ action after having been informed that their campaign manager for North Carolina was directed at an employee when they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .

&quot; weapons do not have to be fired to cause damage , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i .
the indictment was issued only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , when he said a crowd in North Carolina said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ armament and weapons of weapons should take action , if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should appoint and judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ umps campaign was clear that the media had been torn apart from the context , and that he would not lead to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses for the ruling party SPD and CD@@ U are exemp@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this was representative surveys of the opinion research institutions IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue in the north almost more , this is not possible after the surveys in Berlin .
in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore have good opportunities to continue to fight the government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD defeated by 35@@ ,@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
the party therefore sm@@ iled only just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed on the left and the A@@ fr@@ y .
the left came to 19 percent ( formerly 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ ales would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country .
in spite of a slight loss , the Gre@@ ens have hesit@@ ant with 6 percent ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the grav@@ itation of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be present at least 3 percent in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Berlin election of the Congress of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD of the survey was reported only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they are still looking for the Gre@@ ens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ ales would be represented with 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pirates would not miss the entry in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in Time lu@@ pe : Nokia communic@@ ator arrived on the market at 20 years ago .
the followers dominate the world today - its manufacturers experienced a disaster .
the device wei@@ ghed almost half a kilograms and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite con@@ du@@ sty .
the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning eight me@@ gab@@ y@@ tes , that would be enough for about two self @-@ makers with high resolution .
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was created exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , into the business - and it was the first smartphone .
for a few Euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they were somehow from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ network age .
but 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the Ce@@ BIT in Hanover as &quot; office in the West@@ cott format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML @-@ browser , although qu@@ itting slowly .
a pick@@ pocket was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be dis@@ connected like a laptop .
then you found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
quite proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros .
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was 2015 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody was able to guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the cell phones of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled in Microsoft .
today , suppliers dominate the market that made all the way more later than Nokia .
ever and everywhere will be online , this is today for very many people everyday .
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units sold .
global sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless App providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone has become an entire industry in the meantime .
the decisive breakthrough on mass market came from early 2007 , at that time Apple Chef Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet communication , everything via touch @-@ screen easy to use .
the winner of the Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market had the impact .
they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
in the section today every Germans already looks at his cell for 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to learn to disclose the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just Jan@@ ina Ball , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said at the Siemens @-@ Board of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent accessibility is now as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ i , just as in 2012 in 2012 , when we were running a large effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from the Games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will reach again by creating new opportunities for oral and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
for our local communities we will already create 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment .
just as they were ahead of us in London , there will be those who are thinking that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ ay is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ aming on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ g@@ ly 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to over@@ laps , but He@@ a@@ throw answers each other asked questions .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for a single infrastructure project .
enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion to business growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment for both the airport and the whole of GB .
we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years into a row at the world &apos;s best airport terminal , was built up to the T@@ 2 which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequented paths of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that enlargement of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse @-@ game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding indication block &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies wishing to earn online advertising money according to one of the software manufacturers testing , display blocking , a &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would block signs on its des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ gger , in which it hur@@ ried that users could upgrade their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the coding for its advertisements in order to make it more indication of the detection on which part of the page is advertising , difficult to detect .
but Ad@@ block proclaimed that it has found a new way to byp@@ ass the new codes .
in a blo@@ gger , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ fight between the existing open source community and the byp@@ ass have already been underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has launched in the battle is a strong indication of how worrying advertisers are turned into the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people use ad lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion a day of active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ age made up 84 percent of the ads .
the company has it on display blocking on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block lock does not have any effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a enough big share of revenue , so Facebook ga@@ thers the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update its &quot; ad prize pool &quot; to have more control over it to commerci@@ alized advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook indicated that adoption of new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that are no advertising .
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail notice .
ad @-@ blocking are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we instead have focused on development tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control in the hands of the people .
wife suspected suici@@ de suici@@ de on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the free@@ way .
the police calls witnesses after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early hours of the morning on Thursday at an anticipated suici@@ de of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 in the vicinity of Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight .
a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the street and were taken by several cars , said the police in V@@ aud .
it is obvious that a spon@@ ger at the age of 49 years , which was handed over by several vehicles , including a truck , would kill themselves .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , said the police , whom these and every witnesses of the incident requested to report themselves .
it was opened an investigation process , which is an &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation , shared Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter , the Le Trib@@ une de Gene@@ ve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases have been shown in the last five years that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases , when a person ran into the dark on the motorway - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian in the middle of the night running on the highway , as it was in the newspaper .
last year a poli@@ cem@@ an of the homeless kill@@ ings acqu@@ itted after she had over a man and killed , who was in August 2014 one night at the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and died on the street mind , and took the judgment .
the court established that the police had responded to a call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; totally unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably only hab@@ itable according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus in the use of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate research .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could be raised up with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the recent simulation points out that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nevertheless turned up slowly .
the model also illumin@@ ates the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet indicated probably more dry areas than earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected even more quickly ev@@ ap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ izes the slow turn of Venus in the Sun just for two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this enth@@ uses the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface of much of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles the evolution that was previously suspected of planetary research .
although it was likely to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billion years --@@ too much heat and ultra@@ violet light exposed .
her Oce@@ ans ev@@ acu@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burnt from the ultra@@ violet light .
as its hydro@@ gen , only left a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ anche .
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ anche and led to a low @-@ determination degree in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and suggests that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations , the Colorado Aval@@ anche for energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a position .
over the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed , and to bring it to a higher level .
to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization .
it must also have a decision @-@ right for decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
Sak@@ ic , which was announced to Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick told me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy became the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the League .
he carried the society to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the Aval@@ ok@@ er marked in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .

Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ o@@ ir take talks again , put strings from
the labour struggles in regard to the compensation for Northern sea @-@ oil workers are exposed , as all cases of dispute for a new conversation at the table said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field service providers - Wood Group have been operated spor@@ a@@ dically on platforms located in North Sea which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the inv@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the complicated process of current stri@@ fe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to start new problems at the beginning of next year .
the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
wood Group has shortened the rates to its contra@@ indications in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the rates of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage fall for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to come through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and plans to abandon their oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries because its business activities as a result of his me@@ gadrive with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had increased by the decision of the British in June , the European Union .
Scottish Dave Anderson was met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest unemployed persons who took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just a few &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
2016 will be less than $ 1.4 billion on spending on new projects in North Pacific compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of Stars in the constellation of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rotation among the stars of the observatory of the Ple@@ j@@ ade .
the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars revol@@ ves at different rates and in what context the rotation phases are at the planet development .
&quot; we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other constell@@ ations , learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s inf@@ rar@@ ed Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ pile of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this constellation have originated about 125 million years ago , now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
at peak red rates this str@@ apping stars also encounter large amounts of star@@ ches .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a brake effect on the stars .
if a star is aged , his rotation starts to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star -- such as sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ations points out that more solid stars revol@@ ve slower than a massive star .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slow pi@@ rou@@ gh@@ ettes revol@@ ve as smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the ast@@ ering @-@ pile of the ple@@ ad is so close , it serves as an ide@@ alistic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates .
&quot; the observatory of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still much ahead of us that we would like to find out more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported detailed in three newspaper articles about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades , which soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star begins
the tears ran faster by Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US Bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to base .
after his emotional retreat , the 41 year old pro will carry on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays a last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of its New York Yan@@ ke@@ es .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Good@@ bye &quot; to both the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable players of the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature under a tenth of the year contract has been held annually 27 million US dollars annually .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he works in the future as advisor and youth @-@ coach in the future .
as players paid Rodri@@ guez long time with performance back .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; ro@@ us &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 @-@ 2004 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to take some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two more bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics show similar values .
but in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be absorbed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ SP@@ N &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced , between 2001 and 2003 , the b@@ lasted stero@@ ids took place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was locked in August 2013 due to a completion in the so @-@ called bio @-@ art sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the main suspi@@ cious , for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez back then . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his deportation days go out not to be no@@ is@@ eless .
while lots of bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; including Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the ac@@ tress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the ac@@ tress Kate Hudson in , sympathy ad@@ missions of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ ie Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team .
Olympia 2016 : Chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , it is not allowed to launch wei@@ ght@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - Olympic Games 2016 are o@@ vers@@ had@@ owed by the first official release cases .
an enthusiastic athlete had almost one medal .
before the seventh competition , the first official release of the Olympic Games have become famous in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ cu@@ es in Chen X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meters obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa was tested in Brazil and were excluded in Brazil - immediately before the onset of the anyway critical athle@@ tics competitions arrive to this news at the time .
at Chen has been demonstrated by the di@@ ure@@ tics hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king means for dop@@ ing instances .
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of their expulsion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze .
on Friday , Chen would have to take part in the courses over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Chen has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association take the issue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands Chen &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a communication : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S and will accept the verdi@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the restoration of athletes with positive cases .
also during the night of Rio le@@ ak the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to act at the prescribed substance to deal with the blood @-@ dop@@ ing EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was rel@@ o@@ vers@@ ed , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already be positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w will immediately start with criticism of the Ath@@ ab@@ ian word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not drag the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians face under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , for example , approximately all weights from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not compete in Rio .
on Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was well @-@ known , the London @-@ Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , as its brother Tom@@ as@@ z has had a positive effect on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ lon .
both sprin@@ kled , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
in front of the start of athle@@ tics , a further big blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the entire Russian team had banned the entire Russian team to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ings , the le@@ ver@@ far@@ nation Kenya is also producing numerous bad news in Rio .
in the swimming sport , the earlier associations in China had also taken care of intense disputes between the athletes .
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t opened the Chinese Olympi@@ as ger Sun Yang Ger@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ le li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle I want to commit myself , &quot; I said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio .
sun also stood at the heart of an argument with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese Championships on the stim@@ ul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ k@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ resses her sol@@ ders
programmers of black@@ mail mal@@ ware currently act targeted companies - and are successful in this process .
according to a recent survey of mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies were at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail@@ ers .
in Germany just under 20 percent of firms had already been the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 per cent of victims paid will@@ ingly demanded by the perpetrators requested to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alize their press @-@ press according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes attack on attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially cause @-@ pressed ran@@ som be clearly higher than with private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 , most of the painters programs were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpetrators discovered Er@@ press@@ Music software to itself .
only did they use the goal , but the change to corporate att@@ acking was terri@@ fying dramatically over the past few months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware is active after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she specifically looks for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to the archives of pictures and videos .
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als lasting .
then the software presents the demands of black@@ mail@@ ers .
to get the end @-@ turn code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of mal@@ nutrition Bit@@ coin .
but where private users are using the personal photo database at stake , companies are related to sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down .
accordingly , the damage falls if a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests .
22 percent of the German firms involved in sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to dis@@ rupt the business operations , in one case people were in life @-@ threatening .
in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of hospitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say the victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pays not , it supports only the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of firms that pay , get their data back again .
for managers it is difficult to deny the requirement of the perpetr@@ ator in the face of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers from F @-@ Sec@@ ure have examined the commercial areas and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain to their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct support websites create one or de@@ code for free example files .
and are private individuals after payments of a few hundred euros will be rede@@ emed , companies must pay some hard to negotiate and five @-@ digit figures to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explaining security experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti@@ virus provider of Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
probable , it is that it is three or four people .
the programmers sell their pollut@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mailing .
the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware , consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; within delivery is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ mail@@ ers are then looking for further h@@ ackers to spread the freshly made software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and instruc@@ t another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
the payment is made per in@@ tified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually instruc@@ ting the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
in the meantime , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies to better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware to be rep@@ el using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanning software .
accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful creation , thre@@ aten the perpetrators with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing policies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the damage potential according to the type of data is still much higher than before .
the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things in the future .
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated security researchers , as they could get under their control with the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocking heating so many victims could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future will block an entire production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in the Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack up all : a little SU@@ V , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , really proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V looks rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond .
the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls out there .
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
not only is it a trunk of 4@@ 53 l on top @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l under folded back @-@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
this is less magical when it sounds : the seats of the back@@ bench can be high @-@ rated like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the floor up to blankets 1.@@ 24 m high .
the trunk of the trunk is well loaded , however the lo@@ ader with 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the speed of up to 300 N@@ m in wide turn@@ around areas very powerful .
however he should do something qui@@ eter in his work .
pleasing is the everyday consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km .
there is another mot@@ orization : one 1.5 @-@ l @-@ gasoline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
a All@@ ra@@ dan drive is not offered .
the ground @-@ behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but the steering could be a bit more direct .
the equipment is open in the top version &quot; Executive &quot; no desires open .
at the security systems the City @-@ Not@@ bre@@ ms@@ assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the trace assistant .
the coll@@ isions sometimes irrit@@ ate sometimes because he has reviewed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ant objects . &quot;
very reliable works with the open @-@ light assistant .
and the intelligent tem@@ por@@ e@@ gler is responding to the traffic @-@ detection and r@@ uses when needed the speed .
the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch Touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and therefore are a bit awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 Euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will get the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros .
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda provides a versatile and every day @-@ to @-@ day car .
Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on air@@ waves
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on a passenger bridge .
because a liability is conceivable only with dangers that are typical for air traffic , the Supreme Court argued for Düsseldorf ( AZ . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down in the fall of a knee rests .
however , the accident could have been able to happen everywhere - it &apos;s a general risk of life , so judgment .
the airline had no damage set to the man .
disease cases : when pays the organizer
ill vac@@ ation@@ ers get back after their trip only money if the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ ful in the hotel .
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to prove the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was severely ill to diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting for a family on the second day of their door .
she spent almost the whole holiday in the room .
your disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that supposedly had poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the journey was fla@@ vor@@ ful with it - and compl@@ ained on the organis@@ ers .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success in the court .
although the se@@ wage situation was def@@ ective .
but the promot@@ er starts only shortly before departure of the K@@ lä@@ ger .
he had to assume until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
he therefore does not hurt his obligations so the judgment .
especially since in the samples of water no contam@@ in@@ ants have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps im@@ poses to each other - belonging to each other - belonging to the general life @-@ risk .
from 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 ill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had concern about these events . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state must be circumc@@ ised and decided to respond to terror at the same time .
certainly : our country is not able to answer the violence of the perpetrators by hatred and acquisitions .
we will not allow terrorists in this triumph .
if pen@@ ned faster the country would have to leave , however , raise the security and effect also the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve an implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag election in 2017 .
he also announced another personalised reinfor@@ cement of security forces , and indeed &quot; in medium @-@ sized percent@@ ages over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ izing for terrorism must be under punishment .
video surveillance aims to improve arms law so that the purchase of weapons in the Internet is complicated .
the last much discussed silence @-@ light for doctors is supposed to be maintained after the Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; how the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at mental symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care .
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
in pursuit of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of covered investigations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of Minister expressed clearly against shareholders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was a ear @-@ cow@@ ard for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; he said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union for a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a general prohibition of enforcement claims he considers un@@ constitutional .
you can not for@@ bid everything you are ab@@ re@@ jects , and I reject the bur@@ dens of the Bur@@ ka .
talking about rules about traffic or to witnesses in court .
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter gave to the Minister , he wants to sim@@ ulate with new anti @-@ terror packages , as well as procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left wing party Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ ings and a tigh@@ tening of the common right bring people in this country no longer security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better transport flow on the motorway exit
it is che@@ wed regularly on the walk @-@ road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law@@ vote should be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is good news for all cars of motor@@ cyclists who stand in the traffic road every night in St@@ au , when they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road building is extended to the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit Wes@@ er Straße at 700 meters .
drivers can then take directly from the hammer street on the right .
the great advantage : traffic shares premature ejaculation , whereby the total recovery process is improved on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West .
the motor@@ way on the Zu@@ id@@ inger was annoying the motor@@ ists mainly between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back @-@ back ranges from the back to the bridge over the Alber@@ ob@@ serves way and sometimes also beyond .
the reason is the needle on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ er Straße .
from here , traffic is guided only on the highway bridge .
the second track had to be built in a well @-@ three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations revealed that the bridge has no longer the necessary capacity to take in particular the heavy duty of heavy traffic .
how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated p@@ au will last , the relevant provincial operation cannot tell .
however , it has been to be reck@@ oned with years : for the bridge has an official duration of resi@@ dual length up to the year 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the de@@ fle@@ dged version , the state is deliberately chosen the traffic weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities to reck@@ on .
the traffic is run on Tuesday and on Wednesday on the job@@ site .
intercultural journey : cultural offers for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club N@@ IMA &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ IMA is possible to visit young people with a migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Child &apos;s House has a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Young Theatre in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ IMA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intercultural journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of staging in the small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with will have the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most young people in the class were born between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the cens@@ or@@ ical images and video anim@@ ations , it would have been possible to follow the process of action nevertheless , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster .
the Club N@@ IMA &apos;s , founded by Dr Tann@@ az Wes@@ ter@@ berg from spra@@ yers , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theory project .
from October to December , young people with and without fluid and migration background between 14 and 20 years are given the opportunity to visit professionally instructed in the areas singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the theatre play and theatri@@ cal language skills are available in the planning process .
the project &quot; intercultural journey &quot; continues .
given the Ascen@@ ded refugee numbers , the association reck@@ on with many classes who want to participate .
rain instead of ast@@ er@@ holes : hope for weather repair
the weather has the ast@@ er@@ nu@@ bs in the southwest of Germany at night for Friday , a stroke made by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain that was bad to observe the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see many star nu@@ ps in the sky .
the star@@ ch bags are Per@@ sil@@ a , which belong to the fastest star@@ es with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name , because they seem to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the northeast .
relaxing night : tips against in@@ gestion
in the evening , one rolled out forever , at night there is stun@@ ned for hours , in the morning there is far more to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleep disorders , and over ten per cent , experiencing their sleep often or permanently as non @-@ relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleeping @-@ dys@@ functions ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be numerous causes underlying them , stresses Hans @-@ Günter J@@ al , Board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping research and Sle@@ eping Medicine .
what you understand among them is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y @-@ fil@@ tering .
just that perme@@ ates , many people feel as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , a member member of the German Haus@@ ral association with practice at the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep @-@ compul@@ sive disorder ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind can organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ conditional factors , but also drugs are stuck .
not rare is the sleeping @-@ disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early waking up is common in the depression of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ aving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors are in one another .
who for example has a sli@@ pped disk can lie badly , waking up all the two to three hours and then cap@@ sul@@ king over all day @-@ to @-@ day problems and uns@@ ur@@ ling , gives us an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
from when should one talk to a doctor ?
who over a period of one month at least three nights per week is not well sleeps and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , av@@ enge &apos; .
the impairment can look quite different : one is defeated , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or bodily discomfort like stomach or head@@ ache .
to allevi@@ ate the fil@@ tering , it is important to find out their causes .
as a treatment options , such as treatment options occur , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
low @-@ quality dormit@@ ory is available in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore at sleeping , one should first contact the veterin@@ arian , av@@ enge We@@ j@@ on .
the patient can be resolved with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who was going into the dormit@@ ory , and what happens ?
for investigation in the dormit@@ ory , medical advice for example in snor@@ ing with respiratory disorders , for abnormal day @-@ time we@@ ar@@ iness , at bed@@ time or if you do not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t really have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ um@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , one gets to his normal time into the bed .
in addition to the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nose @-@ edge , a chest strap and a thread at the finger .
in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling at bed@@ time .
how can people get the problems under control ?
there are quite a lot of positions that you can set for a better sleep .
We@@ ar counts on : regular dor@@ m and recording @-@ times , not too long in bed , do not sleep watching television , alcohol , and at night don &apos;t look at the clock - then you begin immediately to reck@@ on , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to have
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ closing the DS@@ V teams at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in Doha and presented his first world record at the same time .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete has placed Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook protecting his ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ asi@@ ger gets 20,000 € award and a jungle of 15@@ 0.000 € should no one be wondering about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday on his Facebook page .
the conveyor system in swimming @-@ sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls however very good .
with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not see as precisely the topic of dop@@ ing , or they could even operate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say here the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( N@@ ada ) .
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who cannot control a certain amount of time before the World Cup / OS by independent inspec@@ tors of W@@ ada / F@@ ina must not participate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands the election of Hamburg , who now operates an ice cream . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : ban@@ anas of luggage di@@ so@@ da
professional D@@ be at the Airport Düsseldorf
civilian mar@@ sh@@ ders of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police arrived on Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ - and luggage di@@ eb@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 21.@@ 30 &apos;s civil servants at the airport of the airport Düsseldorf came a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from the past theft of theft . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the mid @-@ July of this year and were involved in a collaborative effort , working and especially professional .
the specialists of the crime commander 34 may have entered the di@@ b@@ ation of criminal off@@ ences to Germany from criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions .
they had a total of more than 15,000 euros .
Alt@@ bauten , a couple of Lin@@ den@@ bach , in the meantime another head@@ stone pav@@ ements : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one walks along the road from the east to the west , one gets along with play@@ grounds , a fres@@ kn@@ itted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ ades .
at the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot;
opposite a li@@ d@@ l which is to be demol@@ ished soon , is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new homes .
article on these &quot; separ@@ ating district &quot; as the authorized property company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , be preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars .
the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile , the inhabitants of rental income , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel Hen@@ kel had been a hard case for a hard course of the police against the project , the region as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point for violence .
after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ ds@@ mi@@ ths , had been cleared with 300 police officers , the police took three weeks of official statements , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams , on site , wi@@ ped parts of the road and kept visitors from starting the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the unknown land@@ owners the rooms .
on July 13 , a Berlin district court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and building workers went up under the che@@ ers of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon , the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , sitting with children sitting on the side@@ walk in front of houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i .
in the immediate vicinity of the domestic projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gartens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the jaw since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs in three children here mainly from the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the domestic projects they share the concern of rising rents and ri@@ vals .
it does not sound according to a jaw , who wants to burn several political forces before v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left .
the dit@@ ch , the Berlin Philharmonic , and the police between household and their neighbors , does not seem to exist .
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which even today compared to the rest of the city a low average person come and has high poverty risk .
also houses and the native land @-@ projects have long been occupied for a long time : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer street near the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a large police battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district of the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and el@@ ic@@ ers from all over the world : with them the inhabitants of the GDR and former house occupied their jaw .
this is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by nearly 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one re@@ alises it in verb@@ ati@@ fied sli@@ ces or freshly kn@@ itted faç@@ ades , which were thrown with color @-@ boards .
no other street was mentioned that year so often together with the words &quot; lef@@ aut@@ on@@ ous violence . &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours can see this as problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodily injury , statistics reveal nearly exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the greatest part of the criminal off@@ ences make claims , the tends to make rather the newly built and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental building next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
for violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they certainly did not have .
even the famous burning cars give it directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , live together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
that &apos;s why it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their road : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claims the interpretation of the district in July .
but in the eyes of the inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : due to character@@ less new constructions in former building blocks , which over@@ sees the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um that are not interesting for many here - here rather people who are not so well tolerated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; force and destruction can I fail completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do , if someone never list@@ ens to anyone ?
there is a frustration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for the drawn carri@@ ages who are angry about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the domestic projects and the left scene were belonged to the jaw .
those who go from , should be aware of it - just like someone who walks into a bar neighborhood where noise can be compl@@ aining about noise .
all persons listed only with first names have asked to be called by their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
besides , she is a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee guard for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration by Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it can be seen as contact for all actors : refugees , Arbeitsk@@ reis Refu@@ ge@@ rics , Administration , Auth@@ orities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer of the working circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le now is there , the ha@@ sten@@ ed wool of wool , which above all have a problem .
thus some - fewer potential tend to be focused on the variety of suitable tasks - meant as the administration wanted to write the job .
he was looking for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , a ei@@ ving lust for lust .
but administration is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network value .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place for three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ ing - and full @-@ time actors are supported .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and jurisdiction problems .
soon new containers are available in the washing machine
a serious problem has been to find for some time , apartments for the connection @-@ linear , which have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the inter@@ connection .
you must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment rooms .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must wear the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Department of Land@@ ister@@ ium and job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto the administration is not finding private apartments .
we do not work yet so far as they are dependent on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common homes have to be er@@ ron@@ eous , as it is called so beautiful .
so soon new containers will soon be positioned in the washing machine .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keywords , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
in addition to a solid base , it are practic@@ alities , training places , school places , one @-@ Euro jobs and aid activities for refugees and migrants who must be rus@@ hed or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house@@ master , do non @-@ profit work - and this motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive effect .
that is &quot; not employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of confidence .
so it offers offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so you can also jump to the administration and honor of the volunteer .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are appreciated in Germany and welcome .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it takes it and it can be sensible to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
who will eventually feel the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , don &apos;t get to work and be un@@ selfish if I will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are also problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some na@@ ï@@ ve could call &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; a Res@@ tr@@ isi@@ ko can and would not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ pers already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also subject to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them fully into dis@@ credit .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so you need to keep the main and honor @-@ standing people on @-@ site and in the region according to activities .
they are always in the background that soon a new shock could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
this question clearly to answer , shy the policy .
actually , it is unfair to put it hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not arrived yet where we would like , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already under@@ utilized to integrate the previous people .
this is currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there is no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars searching for helicop@@ ters
